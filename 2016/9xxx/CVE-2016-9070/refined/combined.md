User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36
Firefox for Android
Steps to reproduce:
I visited some sites (9gag.com, google.com, etc.) in inkognito mode on my Firefox client on Android (Ver. 48.0), 'grep'ed those domains from all files in "/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/\*\*\*\*.default/" and got binary mathes in the files "browser.db" and "browser.db-wal". Although this requires root, still incognito mode should provide some protection, at least it shouldn't leave traces in persistant files.
Actual results:
root@A0001:/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/baro4nyl.default #
grep 9gag\*
Binary file browser.db-wal matches
root@A0001:/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/baro4nyl.default #
Expected results:
root@A0001:/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/baro4nyl.default #
grep 9gag\*
root@A0001:/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/baro4nyl.default #

Is there anything going to happen here? I am pretty sure many people really want to be able to use Inkognito mode without having to be afraid of leaving a history of their activities.

I take it you started off with a fresh profile? Otherwise, if you visited these pages prior, there will be matches. It's an obvious condition of course, but I just wanted to clarify.
I'll take a look into this and report back.

Forgot to mention that, i did clear the apps data through settings as well as reinstalling the app, and made the grep-tests before and after only visiting those websites in Inkognito mode.

I've tried this in the current nightly (51) and in the latest aurora (50.0a2) - two builds I could easily get a hold to run in an i386 emulator - and I can certainly reproduce this.
Culprit seems to be the metadata table. After browsing in the private mode, I see entries for the visited URLs in there.Status: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(gkruglov)

Attached patch is probably enough - however, I can't reproduce this at all anymore to ensure :/ As far as I can tell, this is the only place where we actually write into the metadata table, so just marking this as a no-op for the PrivateTab seems sufficient.

Attached patch

[private-browsing.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8787813&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8787813&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1294438&attachment=8787813)

Let's definitely uplift this into Aurora, and perhaps Beta? Not sure if last week is too late for sec-low fixes to be uplifted.
[Feature/regressing bug #]: private browsing
[User impact if declined]:
Opening private tabs sometimes persists metadata information about the tab, specifically page URL and an icon url. This information is stored, along with a timestamp, in browser.db->metadata table.
If there's root access to the device, it might be possible to see some information about private tabs that were opened.
Note that metadata is not always stored for a tab (I'm not quite sure what the required conditions are), so this bug doesn't always leak private browsing information - but it has the potential.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Manual testing.
[Risks and why]: Low to medium risk; private tab's method to store metadata was overridden to be a no-op. "Store metadata" action is triggered from within Gecko, and I don't have a full understanding of conditions under which it decides to store this information. From manual testing there isn't any visible impact though.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Actual results:
It seems like javascript is executed in the chrome context though so far I can only execute close(), blur() and focus()
Expected results:
Block script execution from content to chrome window.
The theory is that this could be used in the future to execute code in chrome context using other exploits.

What leads you to think this is the case? The document doesn't have the system principal AFAICT. It has a reference to the window currently loaded in the tab, which it can only access if it's same-origin with that thing. Note that 'content' is just defined on Window ( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/Window.webidl#397> ), so the reference also exists in the main content window itself. This is useful if the page in the sidebar \*is\* same-origin with the page you have open in the tab. AFAICT you're not actually successfully breaking the cross-compartment barrier between the sidebar and the main window content, nor does the JS-as-run have system privileges.

Oh - and additionally, you could already use javascript: or data: URIs running in the content browser directly when creating those as bookmarks / bookmarklets, which is a broadly recognized feature-with-security-issues. So even if you could access the content from that sidebar I'm not sure I follow how that alone gains you anything over running javascript: URIs directly against the content window from a bookmark.

> What leads you to think this is the case? The document doesn't have the system principal AFAICT.
The main reason I think so is that when I directly access close or blur its blocked, using the other methods, it seems like it fires. Also the fact that the console shows a javascript error and claims the source of the error is 'about:newtab' brings me to the conclusion that there is some confusion going on.
>and additionally, you could already use javascript: or data: URIs running in the content browser directly when creating those as bookmarks / bookmarklets,
Bookmarketed javascript: urls dont work on privileged windows. I believe javascript: uris are blocked even if the user manually enters it in the address bar within a privileged window.
As far as I know you can't reproduce the behavior I mentioned using non-sidebar bookmarks on privileged windows.
Also, if you open a non-sidebar bookmark of a data: uri while a privileged window is open, it wont result in data: having any higher privileges, as its just content.

I guess its not that we have code running as chrome, but that non-chrome content is accessing (or at least executing) chrome functions which is not supposed to be the case.

Also, the only other way I'm aware of gaining a reference to a chrome owned window is to perform window.open() within a content and then having the user manually navigate to something like 'about:newtab' in the newly opened window. Which would give the same results as here.
Pretty much requires an equal amount of user interaction here.
So the only real question here is whether the behavior as far as executing close(),blur() and focus() is expected behavior or not. My argument is that a content window should never be able to effect a higher privileged window in any way.
So, is this behavior indicative of a potential bug in the future? I will leave that to you guys.

Well, no, it's executing content functions (you're using 'close' from the scope in which the JS is evaluated, ie content) which you've rebound onto chrome-privileged objects, and that then fails with something other than a security error, which is somewhat surprising. I believe the reasoning is that it's possible for web content to close windows it's opened, even when not same-content. It's surprising content.close() doesn't produce the same error as close.bind(content). On the web, "even" windowRef.close() works (irrespective of what's loaded in that window). I also verified that you can use the close rebinding from the sidebar on windows that \*were\* opened by script. That is:
1. open some website
2. in the web console, run e.g. w = window.open("<http://www.mozilla.org/>"); - you probably need to allow popups for this to work well and open a window;
3. open the sidebar bookmark from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window")
4. run 'close.bind(content)();'
will close the tab. That's a lot of effort/specificity for a dos-type issue though...
I think it would make sense if .bind, .call, .apply and friends did a cross-compartment check on arguments, but I don't know if that would be a web-breaking change. Bobby or Boris can likely comment as to whether that's feasible.
Do the blur and focus calls actually do anything? I don't see any user-visible changes, but maybe I'm missing something?
Anyway, all of these would be Core/DOM changes... we can move the bug, but equally I'm not sure to what degree we think sidebars are special here (cf [comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window")) and if there's something we should do in the Firefox front-end to disallow this. We could prevent data/js URIs from loading in the sidebar, but I don't know if that would actually accomplish anything security-wise.

Interesting example. I always assumed that only windows that opened another window (through open()) were able to close tabs. But seems like any window can close a window thats been opened by some other window.
>Do the blur and focus calls actually do anything? I don't see any user-visible changes, but maybe I'm missing something?
I know focus() does, you can test this by reproducing the steps in [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window") (with focus instead of close) and just make your firefox window smaller so that you can see the scrollbars inside the newtab window. Once you execute the focus.blur immediately hit the down arrow key and you will see that you're focused in the newtab.
To test the opposite just click anywhere in the sidebar and try hitting the down arrow and you wont be focused on newtab but rather the sidebar.
So we know these functions are being executed/accessed to an extent.

So, here are some general points from a 100-ft view:
\* As defense-in-depth, we want to avoid allowing untrusted content to get a reference to a chrome window, even though there's no security issue with that per se.
\* There are additional levels of mitigation here if the this is only accessible from code executed in the bookmark sidebar. Still worth avoiding if we can though.
\* Chrome Window / Location objects do not expose the usual cross-origin methods. However, as Abdulrahman correctly points you, you can still call/apply cross-origin getters to it, because methods marked with the [CrossOrigin\*] attributes in webidl do an unconditional unwrap of any security wrapper around |this|. This is probably worth fixing as defense-in-depth, and wouldn't be hard - we just need to replace the UncheckedUnwrap call at [1] with a slightly-smarter helper method that fails if the helper method is not a CrossOriginXrayWrapper instance. Should be a quick patch and extremely unlikely to break anything.
\* I don't think it's useful to mess around with adding security checks to bind/call/apply. The above fix should be sufficient.
In summary, the two things to do with this bug are:
\* Investigate if there's any way we're exposing a chrome window reference to untrusted content, and eliminate it if it's practical.
\* Tighten down the usage of cross-origin-accessible accessors per the suggestion above.

You mean if something being unwrapped is not.
Can we just check the flags that UncheckedUnwrap (optionally) outputs, or is the state we care about not reflected in those flags?

Right.

> the state we care about not reflected in those flags?
It is not reflected precisely, but we could pretty easily do that. Though we could actually just check for IS\_XRAY\_WRAPPER\_FLAG (which is reflected), which is probably good enough.
That might be more complicated than we need though. We still need to check whether the thing is a wrapper at all, since if it's not then the flags won't be there. So we basically want the code to do this:
if (IsCrossCompartmentWrapper(obj) && !IsXrayWrapper(obj)) {
// throw
}
obj = UncheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);

No, because we don't want to throw for a transparent CCW, right?
The right thing might be more like:
if (IsXrayWrapper(obj)) {
obj = UncheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);
} else {
obj = CheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);
}
if (!obj) {
// security error, throw.
}

IIUC the issue here is that we have a content docshell with a chrome window which embeds a content window as an iframe. Is that right, or am I misunderstanding the situation?
In general it seems better to avoid having chrome windows in content docshells. But perhaps that's unavoidable here?Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Close, but not quite.
The sidebar in browser.xul has a <browser> (id=sidebar, no type attribute, so AIUI it ends up being a type=chrome browser - document.getElementById("sidebar").frameLoader.docShell.itemType returns 0) which loads <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/web-panels.xul> which is a privileged page ("chrome window"). That page itself has another XUL <browser> (type=content) that loads the webpage (so yes, kind of like an iframe). The webpage that's loaded in the sidebar is content-privileged, it has the data: URI from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window").
However, it has a reference to the webpage loaded \*in the browser for the current tab\* - which is in a separate part of the document tree (ie not anywhere under the browser#sidebar I started this explanation with). Because the main tabbrowser is type=primary-content, that's what "window.content" refers to in anything under the browser.xul-based docshell tree. It is that primary-content browser that has a chrome-privileged page in, in some cases, such as about:newtab or about:preferences or about:config, etc. etc. (basically any about: page that doesn't have URI\_SAFE\_FOR\_UNTRUSTED\_CONTENT that you load in a tab).
> In general it seems better to avoid having chrome windows in content

It's just software, right? ;-)
We do this for a number of about: pages that are chrome privileged. So to avoid this, we would either:
1) make the docshell we load them in non-content
2) make the pages unprivileged/non-chrome.
For (1), changing the type attribute of the browser and reinserting it into the DOM (without which the type attribute change has no effect) whenever we load a chrome-privileged page would likely lead to functional bugs because the XBL binding state gets lost that way, so that doesn't seem very attractive. Though, to be completely fair, we have some code for this type of thing for when we switch between remote/non-remote browsers (e.g. about:preferences loads in the parent process, webpages don't, and so we do all kinds of evil switches when you back/forward through history/navigation between those things). That code has "issues", but we could potentially look into this if we thought that was actually feasible and important.
For (2), I believe people are working to make about:newtab unprivileged on and off. It hasn't been a priority compared to a lot of other things people want to change about about:newtab. Even if we did that, though, the same problem would continue for things like about:preferences, about:debugging, and about:config, which are much harder to make unprivileged.
TL;DR: this feels like it would be difficult

Is this at all fixable in the DOM/bindings layer? As in, can we just proxy in a null-ish object for any case where the referring item is content-privileged / in a content-privileged compartment, and the referred-to item is chrome-privileged?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
