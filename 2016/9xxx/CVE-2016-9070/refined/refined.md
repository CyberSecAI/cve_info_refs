Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A maliciously crafted page loaded into the sidebar through a bookmark can access a privileged chrome window.
- This is due to a lack of proper cross-compartment checks when using `bind`, `call`, and `apply` on methods and properties of a chrome window from content.
- The `window.content` property in the sidebar is referencing a privileged chrome window in some cases when specific about: pages are opened in a tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-origin bypass:** Content loaded in the sidebar could access properties and methods of a chrome-privileged window loaded in a tab, violating same-origin policy.
- **Privilege escalation:** While not fully privileged execution, the content could call methods like `close()`, `blur()`, and `focus()` on the chrome window, which should not be accessible to content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Limited JavaScript Operations:** The malicious code could execute certain JavaScript operations on the chrome window. This included methods like `close`, `blur` and `focus` on the window, however, it was noted that these were content functions rebound onto chrome objects.
- **Potential future exploits:** The vulnerability could be used in combination with other exploits to gain more control over the chrome context.
- **Denial of service:** Specifically, it was found that the rebinded close() could be used to close tabs, leading to a potential denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sidebar Bookmark:**  A user must create a bookmark with a malicious data or javascript URL and check "load this bookmark in the sidebar". This allows for the malicious code to be loaded into the sidebar.
- **User Interaction:** The user must execute this bookmark when a chrome-privileged page is open in the main tab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **User Action:** An attacker would need a user to create a specific type of bookmark with malicious content and select the option to open in the sidebar.
-   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need specific privileges on the system, this was an issue with how the browser handled javascript.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability was found to be present "forever" as it is a fundamental issue with javascript and compartment handling.
- The fix involves preventing access to chrome window properties and methods when accessed from untrusted content.  It implements a check to ensure that when cross-compartment access is attempted via call/apply, the object being unwrapped is an XrayWrapper.
-   The vulnerability is classified as sec-moderate.
-   The fix was implemented in Firefox 50, with no backports to prior versions, but the patch is included.
-   The report was rewarded with a small bounty.
