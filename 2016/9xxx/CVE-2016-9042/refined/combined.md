-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-17:03.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2017-04-12
Credits: Network Time Foundation
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2017-03-28 04:48:17 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
2017-04-12 06:24:35 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p9)
2017-03-28 04:48:55 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2017-04-12 06:24:35 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p18)
CVE Name: CVE-2017-6464, CVE-2017-6462, CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2016-9042
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
A vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration
directives. [CVE-2017-6464]
A vulnerability was found in NTP, in the parsing of packets from the
DPTS Clock. [CVE-2017-6462]
A vulnerability was discovered in the NTP server's parsing of configuration
directives. [CVE-2017-6463]
A vulnerability was found in NTP, affecting the origin timestamp check
function. [CVE-2016-9042]
III. Impact
A remote, authenticated attacker could cause ntpd to crash by sending a
crafted message. [CVE-2017-6463, CVE-2017-6464]
A malicious device could send crafted messages, causing ntpd to crash.
[CVE-2017-6462]
An attacker able to spoof messages from all of the configured peers
could send crafted packets to ntpd, causing later replies from those
peers to be discarded, resulting in denial of service. [CVE-2016-9042]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with these attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-11.0.patch.xz
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-11.0.patch.xz.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.0.patch.xz.asc
[FreeBSD 10.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-10.3.patch.xz
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:03/ntp-10.3.patch.xz.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.3.patch.xz.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to Port UDP/123 of an affected device.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and follow the recommendations in the product manual.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-211752](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-211752.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0260

## Network Time Protocol Origin Timestamp Check Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### March 29, 2017

##### CVE Number

CVE-2016-9042

### Summary

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted unauthenticated network packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) causing the reply to be dropped and creating a denial of service condition.

### Tested Versions

NTP 4.2.8p9

### Product URLs

http://www.ntp.org

### CVSSv3 Score

CVSSv2: 4.3 - (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
CVSSv3: 3.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### Details

In most modes, NTP prevents spoofing by off-path attackers by verifying that the origin timestamp of an incoming NTP packet
matches the transmit timestamp on the daemon’s last outgoing packet — using the transmit and origin timestamps as a per-request nonce. This test described in RFC 5905 and dubbed `TEST2` in ntpd’s source code. To prevent an NTP daemon from accepting responses to duplicated request packets, RFC 5095 also specifies that the expected origin timestamp should be set to zero after successfully validating the origin timestamp of an incoming packet. Unfortunately, ntpd releases before 4.2.8p9 did not correctly reject incoming packets bearing a zero origin timestamp. This allowed a trivial bypass of TEST2, the origin timestamp check, by setting the origin timestamp on spoofed packets equal to zero (CVE-2015-8138,CVE-2016-7431).

ntp-4.2.8p9 fixes CVE-2015-8138 by rejecting packets with zero origin timestamps in all modes where that is not expected legitimate behavior. However, for reasons unknown, before rejecting a packet bearing a zero origin timestamp, ntp-4.2.8p9 clears the expected origin timestamp (peer->aorg) as can be seen in the following abstracted code:

```
if (0) {
} else if (L_ISZERO(&p_org)) {
        char *action;

        L_CLR(&peer->aorg);
        ...
        peer->bogusorg++;
        peer->flash |= TEST2;	/* bogus */
        ... /* packet will be dropped */
} else if (!L_ISEQU(&p_org, &peer->aorg)) {
        peer->bogusorg++;
        peer->flash |= TEST2;        /* bogus */
        ... /* packet will be dropped */
} else {
        L_CLR(&peer->aorg);
}

```

This leads to a trivial denial of service. An unauthenticated network attacker who knows the address of one of the peers of a
victim ntpd process can send the victim ntpd spoofed packets with the source address of the peer and a zero origin timestamp in order to reset peer->aorg for that peer. This will cause the next packet sent from the peer to fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) and be dropped. The attacker can repeat this each poll period for all known peers in order to prevent their packets from being accepted by the victim ntpd.

This attack is very effective against symmetric associations where the duration between an outgoing packet from the victim ntpd and its “response” will be on the order of seconds to minutes. The attack is more difficult for client-server associations where the request-response window is likely to be on the order of milliseconds. However, if the attacker can observe the victim
ntpd’s request packet, it can attempt to race the remote peer’s legitimate response.

An attacker can learn the currently selected peer of a victim ntpd process by sending the victim a client mode request and reading the peer’s address from the refid field of the victim’s response. This allows the attacker to target the currently selected peer one at a time until it has learned and targeted all peers of the victim ntpd process. If the victim allows NTP control queries or the attacker can observe the victim’s NTP traffic, the attacker can easily learn all the victim’s peers.

The call to L\_CLR(&peer->aorg) when a zero-origin timestamp packet is received appears unnecessary and should be removed. To see that clearing peer->aorg is unnecessary, let’s consider the operation of each NTP mode in turn after omitting the L\_CLR(&peer->aorg):

* Client-Server: Servers are stateless, so the change has no
  effect on them. Clients should not be sending requests with
  zero transmit timestamps and, therefore, should not be receiving
  responses with zero origin timestamps. Thus, removing the
  L\_CLR(&peer->aorg) should have no effect on legitimate
  client-server behavior.
* Broadcast: Broadcast packets are handled separately and thus are
  not influenced by the behavior of this code.
* Symmetric (Active and Passive): When two symmetric peers are
  synchronized to a legitimate time source (0 < stratum < 16) and
  the association between them is fully operational, the origin
  timestamp on incoming packets will be non-zero and equal to
  peer->aorg, thus avoiding the L\_CLR(&peer->aorg). The
  interesting cases occur when there is packet loss or one peer
  resets their association (e.g. ntpd is restarted).

  Without loss of generality, let A be the sender and B the
  recipient of the first packet with pkt->org != peer->aorg. If A
  reset its association with B, pkt->org == 0. Otherwise,
  pkt->org != 0 && pkt->org != peer->aorg. In either case, B will
  mark the packet as having failed TEST2. However, if the packet
  is authenticated correctly for the association, B will update
  peer->xmt = pkt->xmt before rejecting the packet due to failing
  TEST2. In B’s next packet to A, it will set pkt->org =
  peer->xmt and peer->aorg = pkt->xmt, ensuring that the packet
  will pass TEST2 at A, causing it to be accepted by A, and
  overwriting any previous value of peer->aorg at B. A will
  update its peer variables for B as well, ensuring that A’s next
  packet will be accepted by B. From this point on, the symmetric
  association between A and B has successfully resynchronized.

  Thus, we see that recovery from packet loss or peer restart is
  not hampered by allowing peer->aorg to maintain its previous
  value when a packet with a zero origin timestamp is received.
  Further to the point, ntpd versions prior to ntp-4.2.8p6 did not
  clear peer->aorg upon receipt of a packet bearing a zero origin
  timestamp.

### Mitigation

The only ntpd-based mitigations for this vulnerability are to try to
make it harder for an attacker to guess the peers of ntpd instances
and to monitor ntpd logs for messages such as the following:

```
ntpd[16767]: receive: Drop 0 origin timestamp from sym_active@192.168.33.12 xmt 0xdbe84918.63324800

ntpd[16767]: receive: Unexpected origin timestamp 0xdbe849a1.279a6fea does not match aorg 0000000000.00000000 from sym_active@192.168.33.12 xmt 0xdbe849a4.52a12e3a

```

All ntpd instances should be configured to block control queries from untrusted servers. This is best practice.

All ntpd clients should block all incoming traffic that does not originate from a known peer address. This can be accomplished with a stateful firewall.

Because peer->aorg is cleared before authentication is enforced, enabling NTP authentication does not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.

SUMMARY

All versions of the SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA contain multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying third party
component NTP.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA (6GK7443-1UX00-
0XE0):
All versions

Currently no remediation is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to port udp/123 of an affected device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

SSA-211752

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1548

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the
peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate
server responses.
It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been
changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.
