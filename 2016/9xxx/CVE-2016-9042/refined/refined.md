Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how NTP (specifically, ntpd) handles packets with a zero origin timestamp. While NTP is designed to reject such packets as a security measure, a flaw exists in the implementation. Before rejecting a packet with a zero origin timestamp, the `ntpd` clears the expected origin timestamp (`peer->aorg`). This action allows an attacker to reset this expected timestamp.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `ntpd` does not properly validate the origin timestamp in incoming packets, leading to a bypass of the intended security mechanism (TEST2).
*   **State Reset:** Clearing the expected origin timestamp (`peer->aorg`) upon receiving a zero origin timestamp is an unnecessary operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly send spoofed NTP packets with a zero origin timestamp to a vulnerable `ntpd` server. This will cause the `ntpd` server to reset the expected origin timestamp for targeted peers. Consequently, subsequent legitimate responses from those peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2) and be dropped, resulting in a denial of service by preventing the server from synchronizing its clock.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attacker sends specially crafted NTP packets over the network to a vulnerable ntpd server.
*   **Spoofed Packets:** The attacker spoofs the source address of a legitimate NTP peer.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable `ntpd` server.
*   **Knowledge of Peers:** The attacker needs to know (or discover) the IP addresses of the NTP peers that the target server is communicating with. This information can be obtained by monitoring traffic or by sending control queries to the server.
*   **Spoofing Ability:** The attacker needs to be able to send spoofed packets with a manipulated source IP address.
*   **Timing (For Client-Server):** For client-server associations, the attacker may need to race against legitimate responses, making it harder but not impossible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in NTP version 4.2.8p9.
*   Enabling NTP authentication does not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The fix is to prevent clearing of the `peer->aorg` timestamp upon receipt of a packet with zero origin timestamp.
*   This issue affects symmetric associations more easily than client-server associations due to the longer time window for request-response.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
