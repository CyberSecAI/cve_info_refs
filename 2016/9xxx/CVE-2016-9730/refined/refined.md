- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the fact that IBM QRadar SIEM and Incident Forensics allow web requests for sensitive operations to be stored in 3rd party websites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker can execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized alterations of the product and user data.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can use a third-party website to store web requests for sensitive operations which are then executed by a user who has an active session in the targeted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a user with an active session on the targeted application to a malicious third-party website under their control. The attacker does not require to authenticate to the application. The attacker does need to know the API calls to use for malicious actions to be performed.
