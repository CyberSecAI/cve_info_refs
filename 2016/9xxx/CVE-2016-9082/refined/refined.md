Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9082:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability when calculating memory offsets within the `cairo` graphics library, specifically when handling images larger than 4GB on 64-bit systems. This arises from the use of 32-bit integers for image dimensions and strides, leading to incorrect memory addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability lies in the calculation of memory addresses using the formula `image->data + y * image->stride`. Both `y` (row index) and `image->stride` (bytes per row) are 32-bit integers. For images larger than 4GB, the multiplication can overflow, wrapping to smaller values and resulting in out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Incorrect Data Types:** The `_cairo_image_surface` structure incorrectly uses `int` for `stride`, width and height, which can cause overflows when used to calculate memory offsets, particularly on 64-bit systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, because out-of-bounds memory access leads to crashes due to invalid memory reads.
- **Potential Memory Corruption:** There's a mention of potential memory overwrites during `read_png` in an older version of the code (which was partially fixed), however the primary vulnerability in `write_png` leads to out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious SVG Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted SVG files that result in large images when rendered with `librsvg` and `cairo`.
- **Large Images:** Any image-handling functionality using cairo that attempts to process very large images is potentially vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SVG or another form of large image input that will be processed by a vulnerable application.
- **No Specific Location:** No specific positioning is required, the attacker can send malicious data remotely (for example, when a web server processes user-uploaded images using vulnerable software).

**Technical Details:**

- The issue was initially reported with an SVG file causing a crash in `png_write_row` inside `libpng`. This occurred when `cairo` passed invalid pointers to `libpng`.
- The main bug was in the declaration of `_cairo_image_surface`, where `stride` was an `int` instead of `size_t` or `ptrdiff_t`.
- The fix involves changing the type of `stride` to `ptrdiff_t` (or `size_t`). It also involves addressing cases where the calculation of image buffer size was done with 32-bit integers, which were then assigned to a pointer. The multiplication `stride * height` should be checked for overflow and potentially rejected.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is not specific to SVG but also other image formats, and any `cairo` code that processes large images could be affected.
- The bug report also mentions that the function `cairo_format_stride_for_width` should return `ptrdiff_t`, and that the callers should check the return value for error conditions.
- Some code uses the result of the multiplication as the size parameter of a call to `malloc()`. While the overflow in the multiplication is a concern, the `_cairo_malloc_ab` function, which performs allocation, has built-in checks to prevent the overflow when calculating the buffer size.
- There is a historical reference to the out-of-bounds *write* being caused by the same overflow during memory access, but it was found to be less likely.
