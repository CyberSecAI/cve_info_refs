Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9127:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The password recovery form in Revive Adserver was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection in the password recovery form. Specifically, the form did not include any mechanism to verify the authenticity of the request, such as a CSRF token.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could send a large number of password recovery emails to registered users.
- In conjunction with a bug that caused recovery emails to be sent to all users at once, this could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by overwhelming users with password recovery emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into making a request to the password recovery form by visiting a malicious link or webpage which will make the user's browser to send the crafted request to the vulnerable application.
- The request would be made to the password recovery functionality, without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious website or click a malicious link.
