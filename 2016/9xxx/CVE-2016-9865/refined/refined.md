Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9865:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a bug in how phpMyAdmin parses serialized strings. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass the protection offered by the `PMA_safeUnserialize()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Serialized String Parsing:** The core issue is the flawed logic in parsing serialized strings, which can be manipulated to bypass security checks.
*   **Bypassed Protection:** The vulnerability circumvents the intended protection mechanism of the `PMA_safeUnserialize()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided information doesn't specify the exact impact of exploitation, but it indicates the vulnerability is considered "severe." The impact would likely be the ability to inject malicious code through a manipulated serialized string and then potentially perform other attacks. This can lead to various security breaches like data exfiltration, service disruption or arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted, malicious serialized string to the phpMyAdmin application. The details of how this string is sent are not mentioned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted malicious serialized string to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance. The attacker can either be authenticated or unauthenticated based on other listed vulnerabilities impacting the same component.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.18).
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-661, which relates to "Incorrect Operation Order."
*   Patches were released to fix the vulnerability on the 4.0, 4.4 and 4.6 branches
*   The Debian security advisory also lists the vulnerability as affecting phpMyAdmin and recommends an upgrade, as well as listing it among other related vulnerabilities.
