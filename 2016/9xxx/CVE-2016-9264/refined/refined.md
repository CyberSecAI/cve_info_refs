Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9264:

**Root Cause:**
- A global buffer overflow exists in the `printMP3Headers` function within `listmp3.c` of the libming library. This overflow occurs when accessing the `mp1_samplerate_table`, `mp2_samplerate_table` and `mp25_samplerate_table` arrays. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read happens due to an invalid `samplerate_idx`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a global buffer overflow, meaning that memory outside of the intended buffer is accessed, leading to a read out of bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** The provided ASan output shows the program crashes due to the global buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service if the vulnerable program is processing user-supplied MP3 data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although not directly described in the provided information, a carefully crafted attack could potentially manipulate program behavior through the out-of-bounds memory access, although in this case it is a read out of bounds.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed MP3 Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed or specifically crafted MP3 file that leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the samplerate tables using the index obtained from the MP3 header.
- **Direct Execution of `listmp3` Binary:** The blog post notes that if a web application calls the `listmp3` binary directly to parse untrusted MP3 files, then it is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable program (specifically, `listmp3`) with a crafted MP3 file or control the input stream to the `listmp3` binary.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered by the input data itself, therefore, no prior authentication is needed for a successful attack.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected versions:** libming 0.4.7.
- **Fixed version:** libming 0.4.8.
- **Fix:** The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the `samplerate_idx` is within the bounds of the available tables. The fix also involves using a constant `MP3_SAMPLERATE_IDX_MAX`.
- **Reproducer:** A proof-of-concept is available at the provided github link: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00034-libming-globaloverflow-printMP3Headers`
- **Discovery:** Discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
