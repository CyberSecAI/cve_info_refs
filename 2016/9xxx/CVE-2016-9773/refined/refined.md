Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-9773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `IsPixelGray` function within `pixel-accessor.h` of ImageMagick. This occurs even in versions that included a fix for CVE-2016-9556, indicating an incomplete or incorrect fix for the original issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: A read operation attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer in the `IsPixelGray` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow, which is detected by AddressSanitizer (ASan).
- In a successful exploit, it could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image file with the `identify` command of ImageMagick.
- The `IsPixelGray` function is called within the process of identifying the image, which triggers the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file to ImageMagick.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `identify` command on the target system using the crafted image.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
- The vulnerability exists in ImageMagick version 7.0.3.8, which was intended to fix the issue from CVE-2016-9556.
- A patch was created by upstream to resolve the issue.
- A reproducer is publicly available at the provided link.
