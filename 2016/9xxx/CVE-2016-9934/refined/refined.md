        "data": "The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `php_wddx_push_element` function during WDDX packet deserialization with a PDORow object. \n\nWhen a PDORow object is created during WDDX packet deserialization, the object's properties are accessed using the `Z_OBJPROP_P` macro. However, the PDORow object is not properly initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference when the get_properties handler is called. \n\nAffected Products:\n\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7.7 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7.6 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7.5 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7.4 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7.3 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 7 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 6.7 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Server) 1 for RHEL 6 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Workstation) 1 for RHEL 7 x86\_64\n* Red Hat Software Collections (for RHEL Workstation) 1 for RHEL 6 x86\_64"
