Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-9570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Carbon Black sensor processes data received through a named pipe (`\\.\pipe\netmon`).
- It uses a command type number to select a handler.
- When command type '4' is used, a DWORD at a specific offset (`Buffer_Base + 0x7B`) is interpreted as the size for a memory allocation.
- The program allocates memory based on this size, but does not properly validate the size against the actual input data, causing an out-of-bounds write during the copy of the input data to the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Read-Out-Of-Bounds:** The primary vulnerability is a read-out-of-bounds. While the code checks the size is not negative or zero before allocating the memory, it does not validate the provided size against input buffer, allowing the copy operation to write outside allocated input data buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability results in a crash of the Carbon Black Sensor due to an invalid pointer dereference. This leads to a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to send data to the `\\.\pipe\netmon` named pipe of the Carbon Black sensor module
- The attacker has to send a command type of '4'
- The attacker must supply a large value for the size parameter at offset `Buffer_Base + 0x7B`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to hijack or access the `NetMon` named pipe to send specially crafted data to the Carbon Black sensor. This suggests the attacker needs to be local, or have a privileged position on the network which allows them to reach that pipe.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content gives a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability with assembly code snippets. It mentions that while the code does a check to prevent an integer overflow during the allocation, it doesn't perform validation of the supplied size against the input data buffer during copy operation, which leads to the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects version 5.1.1.60603 of the `cb.exe` module.
- The vulnerability has been remediated.
