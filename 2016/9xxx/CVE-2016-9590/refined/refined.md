  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A puppet script, used during the installation of Red Hat OpenStack Platform director's Object Storage (swift), incorrectly removes and recreates the proxy-server.conf file with world-readable permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The puppet script overwrites the configuration file with incorrect permissions, leading to information disclosure."
    ],
    "impact": "An information disclosure vulnerability where sensitive information in the proxy-server.conf could be read by any user on the system due to world-readable file permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the affected system is required to exploit the vulnerability. No network access is required."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to the system where OpenStack Object Storage (swift) is installed and the puppet script is executed. No special privileges are required to read the misconfigured config file."
