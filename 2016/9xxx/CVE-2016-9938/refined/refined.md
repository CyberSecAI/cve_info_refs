- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `chan_sip` channel driver in Asterisk incorrectly handles whitespace characters between a SIP header name and the colon, treating any non-printable ASCII character as whitespace. This deviates from RFC 3261, which specifies only spaces and horizontal tabs should be treated as whitespace.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation/handling of whitespace characters in SIP headers, specifically in the `chan_sip` driver. This leads to a discrepancy in how SIP headers are parsed by Asterisk and SIP proxies.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can bypass authentication by sending specially crafted SIP INVITE requests. These requests can appear as in-dialog to a SIP proxy (due to valid and invalid To header combinations) but will be treated as out-of-dialog requests by Asterisk, thus bypassing authentication checks and allowing unauthorized call processing.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted SIP INVITE requests with non-standard whitespace characters in header fields to an Asterisk server configured with the vulnerable `chan_sip` driver and behind an authenticating SIP proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the Asterisk server. The Asterisk server needs to be configured with the vulnerable `chan_sip` driver and must be behind an authenticating SIP proxy.
