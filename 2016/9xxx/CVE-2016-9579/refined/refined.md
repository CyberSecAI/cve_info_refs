  "CVE-2016-9579": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Ceph Object Gateway would process cross-origin HTTP requests if the CORS policy was set to allow origin on a bucket. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service by sending a specially-crafted cross-origin HTTP request.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Ceph Object Gateway (RGW) did not properly handle specially-crafted cross-origin HTTP requests when a CORS policy was set to allow any origin on a bucket. The vulnerability lies in how the `RGWCORSRule::is_origin_present` function is used when matching the `Origin` header against a configured CORS rule. Specifically, when the `Origin` header is too short, the `std::string::substr` method can throw an `std::out_of_range` exception, leading to a server abort.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Out-of-bounds read (via string substring operation)"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted HTTP request, causing the RGW service to crash.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "Remote network access via HTTP requests with a crafted `Origin` header."
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Ceph Object Gateway endpoint and must know the name of a bucket with a CORS rule that allows the origin.",
    "affected_versions": "Red Hat Ceph Storage 1.3 and 2.1, as well as other Ceph versions.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when an HTTP request includes a crafted `Origin` header that is too short, causing an out-of-range exception during string substring operation, leading to the service aborting. The `RGWCORSRule::is_origin_present` function does not properly check the `Origin` header length before comparing it to the allowed origin in the CORS rule."
