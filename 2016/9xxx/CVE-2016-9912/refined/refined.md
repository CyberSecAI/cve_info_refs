Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-9912:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `virtio-gpu` device emulation within QEMU. Specifically, when a guest destroys a GPU resource, the associated memory mappings (`iov` and `addrs` fields) are not properly freed, leading to a leak. This occurs because the cleanup function `virtio_gpu_cleanup_mapping` is not called during resource destruction.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Failure to free allocated memory when a virtio-gpu resource is destroyed by the guest.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A guest user/process can trigger the memory leak, leading to the consumption of host memory and potentially causing the host to become unstable or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or compromised guest operating system within a virtualized environment can exploit this vulnerability by creating and destroying GPU resources repeatedly without freeing allocated memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a QEMU guest. This typically means the attacker has access to a virtual machine where they have user or root level permissions.

**Additional Details**
- The fix involved calling `virtio_gpu_cleanup_mapping` in the `virtio_gpu_resource_destroy` function to free the memory.
- The vulnerability was present in QEMU versions prior to 2.8.0.
