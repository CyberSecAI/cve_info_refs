Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the interaction between Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP to HTTPS redirects, specifically when a CSP directive uses an explicit port number (e.g., `img-src http://example.com:80`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSP Bypass:** The vulnerability exploits a flaw in how CSP handles port matching. A CSP that explicitly specifies a port (e.g., `http://example.com:80`) allows the HTTP version of the site but blocks the HTTPS version (`https://example.com`).
*   **Timing Attack:** By setting a CSP directive to block HTTPS requests while allowing HTTP, a malicious server can measure the time it takes for the browser to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. This timing difference reveals if the redirect occurs due to a cached entry (meaning a previous visit) or a server-side redirect (first visit), effectively allowing an attacker to probe the user's browsing history.
*   **HSTS/301 Redirection:** The vulnerability leverages the browser's behavior of automatically redirecting HTTP to HTTPS URLs, especially with HSTS enabled, and uses this redirection to measure the user's browsing history.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Browser History Probing:** An attacker can determine which websites a user has previously visited, potentially revealing sensitive information about their browsing habits.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to infer user interests and activities, violating their privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** A malicious website includes a CSP directive (e.g. `img-src http://example.com:80`) that blocks the HTTPS version of a target URL.
*   **Image Loading:** The malicious website then tries to load images from target URLs, and measures the response time.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The time taken to load the image reveals whether the target URL had an HSTS redirect entry (or other cached redirect), thus indicating previous visitation of that site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious website and control the CSP directives.
*   **Knowledge of Target URLs:** The attacker must know the specific target URLs they want to probe from the user's history.
*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker must have control of the web server to manipulate the CSP headers, and therefore be able to perform the timing attack.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The vulnerability is reproducible on Firefox 47.0.1 (and was also present in Chrome, tracked as CVE-2016-5137, and WebKit).
* The fix involves normalizing port matching in the browser's CSP implementation to treat HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 as equivalent for comparison purposes.
* The vulnerability is classified as "sec-low" severity, indicating a limited risk impact compared to other vulnerabilities.
