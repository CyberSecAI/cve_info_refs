| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1404096#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2016-12-13 03:25:44 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.0.2 and Firefox ESR 45.5.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3757-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : icedove
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9893 CVE-2016-9895 CVE-2016-9897 CVE-2016-9898
                 CVE-2016-9899 CVE-2016-9900 CVE-2016-9904 CVE-2016-9905

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple vulnerabilities may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code, data leakage or bypass of the content
security policy.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.6.0-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

I took a look at [bp-9fc65d48-5d23-4c6b-a890-a24b12160812](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/9fc65d48-5d23-4c6b-a890-a24b12160812), and it looks like FlushLayoutRecursive is being called with aDocument == 0xE5E5E5E5E5E5E5E5. That one was amd64, where the "Crash Address" field tends to be less reliable. On x86 crashes, most crashes appear to have a crash address of 0xe5e5e5e5.
That's apparently how jemalloc marks freed memory.

> aDocument == 0xE5E5E5E5E5E5E5E5
That implies a deallocated shell, which is a bit strange since the only caller
of DispatchSynthMouseMove holds a strong ref on that shell on the stack:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/annotate/6cf0089510fa/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp#l5858>
and DispatchSynthMouseMove calls FlushLayoutRecursive with mDocument
(line 3718) which is a nsCOMPtr member on that shell.
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-unified/annotate/6cf0089510fa/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp#l3687>
It seems possible that aDocument might not be alive after line 3691 though,
in case mDocument changed as a result of line 3691, but then it seems like
it should indicate line 3692 as the crash site.

fix?
If the list of subdocuments that EnumerateSubDocuments is iterating over changes while iterating over it (because we flush in a callback that causes it to change) then we'd also have a problem, no?

I had a look at the minidump, it's aDocument itself that is 0xe5e5e5e5, not the contents of the document.
That would suggest that the SubDocMapEntry (referenced in EnumerateSubDocuments) that has been deleted and poisoned.

part 2 - Make EnumerateSubDocuments resilient to adding/removing sub-documents.
Actually, let's just go ahead and try landing this on esr45. Dan and I discussed it and we have some time to respond if there are issues.

I can't produce patches for esr45 because [bug 881832](/show_bug.cgi?id=881832 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make inner document reflow asynchronous to improve performance") etc needs to land on esr45 first.
I suspect that this will apply without conflicts once they have.Flags: needinfo?(mats)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Pocket toolbar button, once activated, listens for events fired from it's own pages but does not verify the origin of incoming events. This allows content from other origins to fire events and inject content and commands into the Pocket context.

#### [#CVE-2016-9893: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 50.1 and Firefox ESR 45.6](#CVE-2016-9893)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 50.0.2 and Firefox ESR 45.5.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Jan de Mooij, Iris Hsiao, Christian Holler, Carsten Book, Timothy Nikkel, Christoph Diehl, Olli Pettay, Raymond Forbes, and Boris Zbarsky reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 45.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1317936#c0)• 8 years ago |
|  | |

JS code can use a Map/Set timing attack to determine whether an atom is used by another compartment/zone. See [bug 1312001](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312001 "VERIFIED FIXED - ASLR leak and cross-frame oracle via pointer scrambling in Map/Set").
The plan ([bug 1312001 comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1312001#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - ASLR leak and cross-frame oracle via pointer scrambling in Map/Set")) is to add a hash code to atoms, to avoid leaking information about the atom's address.

Unfortunately this will add 8 bytes to all atoms, due to GC alignment restrictions. In theory we could use the 4 unused bytes as extra inline storage, but that will complicate things tremendously. Another option is to store the hash code only for atoms with length > X and calculate it lazily for short strings. Maybe we can do that as a follow-up.

Attached patch

[Part 1 - Add hash code to atoms and use it for Map/Set](attachment.cgi?id=8811253&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8811253&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1317936&attachment=8811253)

This adds a hash to all atoms and uses it in HashableValue::hash().
I think we have to fix jsid hashing to use this hash as well, since ShapeTables likely have a similar issue :/

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a nice clean patch.
Not for this bug, but now that we have separate thing kinds for atoms would it be possible to get rid of the ATOM\_BIT flag and the process of morphing strings into atoms?

Nice idea. I think it would hurt perf though as isAtom() is queried on some very hot paths (including JIT code we generate for comparing strings).

Attached patch

[Part 2 - Fix jsid hashing](attachment.cgi?id=8812732&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8812732&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1317936&attachment=8812732)

This changes jsid hashing to use atom->hash() if the id is an atom, to prevent a similar attack on shape tables.
I had to move DefaultHasher<jsid> to an internal header, a bit unfortunate but there are no consumers outside SpiderMonkey atm. The alternative is to move HashId out of line but I'd like to avoid the perf overhead of that for now.
When this is on all branches I'll post another patch to add comments.

Part 1 - Add hash code to atoms and use it for Map/Set
Requesting approval for both patches.
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not trivial. Maybe with some work.
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
> Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Should be possible to backport this. There is some risk but this has to be in 51.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Perf and correctness regressions are certainly possible, but having this code in a few Nightlies before uplifting should be sufficient I think.

Part 1 - Add hash code to atoms and use it for Map/Set
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Old bug.
[User impact if declined]: Security issues.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: This code is exercised by pretty much all tests we have.
[Risks and why]: These patches are not trivial so there is some risk. But still, this code is exercised a lot and Nightly testing didn't reveal any issues so far AFAIK.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None.

This was already landed on ESR45 for the 45.6 release, so I think that makes this more important to ship with 50.1 as well.

Setting tracking- for fixed bugs seems to conflate bug status with severity and is a dangerous practice in general (What happens if a bug gets backed out? Are we going to rely on luck that it ends up back on RelMan's radar at that point?). Especially for security bugs, can we please stop doing this?

Can't write an advisory for this issue without 0day'ing ESR45 because the fix in ESR45 doesn't ship until January. This should not have gone into 50.1.

Ok. There is an ESR 45.6 release going out with 50.1. This should be in the advisories for both unless the disclosure precludes that.

I was trying to understand the whiteboard, "Disclosure date ~Jan 21 2017 (note Fx51 scheduled for Jan 24)".
Dan Veditz says that it shouldn't limit us writing an advisory as it is just indicating when the reporter will be disclosing per his own policy.Flags: needinfo?(jdemooij)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)
