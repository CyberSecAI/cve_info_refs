Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9949:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Apport crash reporting tool in Ubuntu improperly uses the `eval()` function on the `CrashDB` field within a `.crash` file. This field is intended to hold configuration data, but the use of `eval()` allows for arbitrary Python code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the `CrashDB` field is evaluated as Python code via the `eval()` function. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Python code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `CrashDB` field is not properly validated or sanitized before being passed to `eval()`. This allows an attacker to introduce malicious code within the field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user opening the crafted `.crash` file. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a crafted `.crash` file is placed in `/var/crash` (writable by low-privileged users for system crashes) and a user with uid < 500 opens it and accepts the prompt, code execution as root can be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker can create a malicious `.crash` file and trick a user into opening it.  Since Apport is the default handler for `.crash` files, simply clicking on such a file triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Downloads:** Attackers could use methods like a malicious download through a web browser to place a crafted `.crash` file on the target's system.
*   **Exploitation via other Vulnerabilities:** An attacker could use other vulnerabilities (e.g., an SQL injection) to write a malicious `.crash` file to the `/var/crash` directory to be automatically executed by a user login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a crafted `.crash` file:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a file with the "ProblemType:" prefix that includes a malicious `CrashDB` field containing Python code.
*   **Ability to deliver the file to the target user:**  The attacker needs a way to make the victim open the file. This could be through email, file sharing, or other means.
*   **User interaction:** For a successful exploit, the victim user needs to open the crafted `.crash` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Ubuntu Desktop versions 12.10 (Quantal) and later.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the `eval()` function with `ast.literal_eval()`, which only evaluates literal structures and not arbitrary code.
