Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the `usersController.php` file in the Exponent CMS. Specifically, the `show()` function was not properly restricting access to user records. The original code allowed logged-in users to view other user records and administrators to view super-admin records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. The system relied on `($user->isAdmin() || ($user->id == $id))` for access to user details. This allows any logged in user to potentially view details of another user by changing the id in the url. Further, the system did not prevent administrators from viewing super admin records via the same logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view sensitive information of other users, including super-admin user accounts, which could include private information. This information could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request Modification:** The attacker can modify the 'id' parameter in the URL to view other users' records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of the system.
- **Knowledge of user IDs:** The attacker would need to know or guess the user ID in order to target specific users.
- No special privileges are required other than being logged in.
