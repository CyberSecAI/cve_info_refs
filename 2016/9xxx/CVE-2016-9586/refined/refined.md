{
  "CVE-2016-9586": {
    "description": "libcurl's implementation of the printf() functions triggers a buffer overflow when doing a large floating point output. The bug occurs when the conversion outputs more than 255 bytes.\nThe flaw happens because the floating point conversion is using system functions without the correct boundary checks. \nIf there are any applications that accepts a format string from the outside without necessary input filtering, it could allow remote attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in libcurl's implementation of printf() functions, specifically when handling large floating-point output. It occurs because the floating point conversion uses system functions without proper boundary checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to insufficient boundary checks when converting large floating-point numbers to strings."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) or execute arbitrary code, particularly in applications that accept format strings from external sources without adequate input sanitization.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by providing a large floating point number that, when converted to a string, exceeds the buffer size.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input to a `printf` style function. This includes providing a format string and the associated floating-point value."
