Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe generation of the `blowfish_secret` key in phpMyAdmin. This key is used for encrypting cookies. When a user does not explicitly define a `blowfish_secret` in the `config.inc.php` file, phpMyAdmin generates one at runtime using a weak algorithm.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Weak Random Number Generation:** The core issue is the use of a weak algorithm to generate the `blowfish_secret` key when it is not defined by the user. This results in a predictable secret.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker who can determine the user's `blowfish_secret` can potentially decrypt their cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's session and the phpMyAdmin application.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack is carried out remotely by an attacker.
-   The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses phpMyAdmin with cookie-based authentication, and the user has not defined a custom `blowfish_secret` in their configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to observe or deduce the generated `blowfish_secret` through the weak algorithm used by phpMyAdmin.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity.
-   The vulnerability only affects cookie authentication.
-   The issue is resolved by upgrading to phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.5, 4.4.15.9, 4.0.10.18 or newer, or by applying the provided patches.
-   The Gentoo security advisory mentions this CVE as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities, which affected phpMyAdmin.
-   The official phpMyAdmin advisory also provides references to code commits that address the issue in different branches (4.0, 4.4, and 4.6).
