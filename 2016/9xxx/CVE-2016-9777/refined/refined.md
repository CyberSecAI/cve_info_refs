  "cve": "CVE-2016-9777",
  "description": "Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory access issue. It could occur on x86 platform, while servicing I/O APIC requests with larger vcpu_id. A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or it could potentially be used to escalate privileges on a host.",
  "affected_versions": "Linux kernel with KVM support on x86 platforms",
  "root_cause": "The KVM implementation used arrays of size `KVM_MAX_VCPUS` indexed by `vcpu_id`. However, `vcpu_id` can be greater than the maximal number of VCPUs, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds memory access"
  ],
  "impact": "A guest user/process can crash the host kernel (DoS) or potentially escalate privileges on the host.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A guest can trigger the vulnerability by sending I/O APIC requests with a large vcpu_id."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest user/process running inside a virtual machine is required to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "fixes": [
    "The fix involves changing the size of the arrays to use `KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID` instead of `KVM_MAX_VCPUS`"
