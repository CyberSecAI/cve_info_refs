Based on the provided commit message, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message "Fix #3845 : sécuriser les exec info\_plugin et puce\_statut" indicates that the vulnerability lies within the execution of `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` functions in SPIP.  The commit is intended to secure these executions, suggesting they were previously insecure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The commit message implies that there were security vulnerabilities in the execution of the `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` functions before this patch. The exact nature of these vulnerabilities is not specified in the commit message but it suggests there might have been insecure handling of user-supplied data or lack of proper sanitization when these functions are executed. It could involve arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The commit message doesn't detail the impact, but the fact that it's a security fix to `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` suggests that exploitation could lead to serious consequences, such as:
    * Arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to take control of the server.
    * Information disclosure, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
The commit message does not describe the attack vectors. However, given the functions are named `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` they likely involve requests from a remote attacker to invoke these functions. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to make requests to the SPIP application that result in the execution of `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` with malicious input. It is implied that this attack would be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
The commit message mentions "merci à felixk3y de PKAV Team pour le signalement", indicating that the vulnerability was reported externally. The fix was implemented in commit `347cae39`. This commit message is more descriptive than the CVE.
