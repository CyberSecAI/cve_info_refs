The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9049.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check on the result of a memory allocation (`cf_malloc`). A crafted packet with a size value that causes the allocation to fail results in a subsequent null pointer dereference during a `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing check on the return value of `cf_malloc`.
- Null pointer dereference due to failed memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS) of the Aerospike Database Server. The server process crashes due to the null pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted packet to the fabric port (3001/TCP) of the Aerospike server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the TCP port 3001 of the target Aerospike server.
- The attacker can send a crafted packet with a large size value to trigger the vulnerability.
