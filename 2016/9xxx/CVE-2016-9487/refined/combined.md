## EpubCheck 4.0.1 contains a XML external entity processing vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#779243

Original Release Date: 2016-12-13 | Last Revised: 2016-12-14

---

### Overview

EpubCheck 4.0.1 is vulnerable to external XML entity processing attacks.

### Description

| EpubCheck is a tool to validate that EPUB files follow the proper format. It can be used as a stand alone command line utility, or included in a project (most commonly being epub readers) as a library.  **CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')** - CVE-2016-9487 EpubCheck 4.0.1 does not properly restrict resolving external entities when parsing XML in EPUB files during validation. An attacker who supplies a specially crafted EPUB file may be able to exploit this behavior to read arbitrary files, or have the victim execute arbitrary requests on his behalf, abusing the victim's trust relationship with other entities. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to access arbitrary files on a system, or cause the system execute arbitrary requests. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  EpubCheck has released version 4.0.2 to address the vulnerability. |
