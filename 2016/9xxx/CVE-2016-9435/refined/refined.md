    "description": "The HTMLtagproc1 function in file.c in w3m before 0.5.3+git20161009 does not properly initialize values, which allows remote attackers to crash the application via a crafted html file, related to <dd> tags.",
    "affectedSoftware": {
      "name": "w3m",
      "version": "before 0.5.3+git20161009"

    "rootCause": "Improper initialization of values in the HTMLtagproc1 function, specifically related to <dd> tags.",
    "vulnerabilityDetails": [
      "Use of uninitialized values leads to incorrect program behavior.",
       "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted HTML file with specific tags.",
       "A conditional PUSH_ENV(HTML_DL) call was added to handle uninitialized values during the processing of <dd> tags.",
