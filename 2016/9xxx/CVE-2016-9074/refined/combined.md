##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Ehsan Akhgari, Jon Coppeard, Gary Kwong, Tooru Fujisawa, Philipp, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

                 CVE-2016-9066 CVE-2016-9074 CVE-2016-9079

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
same-origin policy bypass issues, integer overflows, buffer overflows
and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or
denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1 or earlier.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

[window-create.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8774583)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8774583&action=edit)

I've attached a WebExtension, that does this:
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
chrome.windows.create({
url: "popups/popup.html"
});
});
"popups/popup.html" is a path to a file packaged with the add-on. In Chrome, the document is loaded. In Firefox, A new window opens, and tries to load "<http://www.popups.com/popup.html>".

We don't currently do any resolution or security checks for these URLs. The most obvious problem this causes is that relative URLs don't work. But it also gives extensions the ability to load arbitrary URLs with the DANGEROUS\_TO\_LOAD flag, which is a much bigger problem.Assignee: nobody → kmaglione+bmoKeywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)Summary: chrome.windows.create doesn't work with relative paths → windows.create schema doesn't specify "format": "relativeUrl"

Resolve URLs passed to windows.create relative to the caller
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily, without further details about the bug.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
This patch does not, but the follow-up patch with additional security tests does.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All supported branches are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This patch should apply cleanly, or with minimal modification, to all non-ESR branches. ESR may require non-trivial modification.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely. The method that this changes is relatively well-tested, and the changes do not affect existing tests. Existing code should only be adversely affected if it is already passing illegal URLs, either maliciously or inadvertantly.

Add tests for attempted loads of unsafe URLs
This makes sense as far as testing that common URLs rejected by checkLoadURL() aren't valid parameters for windows.create(), but I don't really understand what URI\_DANGEROUS\_TO\_LOAD means and hence what the vulnerability in this is. So either a review by somebody who does understand or a more detailed explanation here would be good.

Resolve URLs passed to windows.create relative to the caller
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: N/A
[User impact if declined]: This bug allows WebExtensions to load privileged URLs, and to potentially break out of their security sandbox.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: The API that this change affects is covered by existing tests, and this patch adds additional tests for the changes. A separate patch adds tests for the security issues that this addresses.
[Risks and why]: Low. The method that this changes is relatively well-tested, and the changes do not affect existing tests. Existing code should only be adversely affected if it is already passing illegal URLs, either maliciously or inadvertantly.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.82 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Firefox Version: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
1. Download the poc.zip file
2. Put the p.url file into the Path 'C:/'
3. Open the spoof.html, click the 'sumbit' button, wait and reproduce this issue.
spoof.html:
<form action="file://127.0.0.1/c:/p.url" target="xx" method="post" onsubmit="setTimeout(k, 2020)" id="c">
<input type="submit">a</input>
</form>
<script>
function k(){
window.open("ja vascript:document.writeln('Spoof Google.com<img src=# onerror=alert(location.href)>!!')","xx");
}
</script>
You could find more details by watching PoC.mp4 and watch PoC.png
Actual results:
The attacker could spoof and inject javascript code into any web pages. In the PoC, you could find the google.com is spoofed and the same-origin police has been bypassed.
Expected results:
Never change the address bar and navigation utill the page has been full loaded.

If you have to convince a user to download a file to a specific path that the website then needs knowledge of to get to a spoof, that feels like it's very hard to exploit. If you can direct the user to download a particular file to a particular location, it feels like that would enable you to do more severe things than spoof the location bar. In other words, I'm not really sure about the severity here.
In fact, does this work if spoof.html is hosted on http? The screenshot shows it on file:///. I would expect it to only work if hosted locally, because the POST to file:/// is presumably not allowed. And if that \*is\* allowed, that feels much more like a docnav issue to me than something to do with the location bar.

> loaded.
As written, I don't believe this helps (and it has other downsides both from a UX and security perspective). AIUI, it is possible for the testcase to work even if google.com loads fully - in fact, if location.href has been updated to reflect google.com, it \*is\* loaded (at least to some degree - waiting for extra images or stylesheets or whatever won't make a difference here).
Instead, the location bar should be updating when the JS runs, though I'd argue that the JS shouldn't be running against the other window at all, because it shouldn't have the same principal as the file-linked-to-google.com document. That's a Core issue, and it wouldn't go away by just not updating the location bar.
Boris, I would expect that we get notified (like through nsIWebProgressListener) when the JS runs here somehow. As noted, I also think the JS shouldn't be running at all, and the fact that it does is a Core issue that needs to be addressed. Am I missing something?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Also pulling in Christoph because of the ... interesting... similarities with [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss"). Which is fixed for 48. Not sure why it's not helping here.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

There is nothing preventing POST to a file:/// URL that I know of. It just gets turned into a GET, with the postdata dropped on the floor.
This does in fact look like [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") to me. And at least on Mac if I try the attached testcase (replacing the .url file with an equivalent .desktop file) I don't see the JS running or the spoof working.
I assume the problem \_is\_ reproducible on Windows? If so, I'd really appreciate it if someone who has easy access to a Windows debug build could check what things look like in nsJSProtocolHandler.cpp, in the nsJSThunk::EvaluateScript, around the principal->Subsumes(objectPrincipal) call. What are principal and objectPrincipal in this case?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Wait. The patch for [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") is using "^" and not "&~" to remove the security-inheritance bit? Which means it might be \_adding\_ it in this case in some situations? That could explain what's going on, if so... :(
Gijs, if you change
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() ^
nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
to:
nsSecurityFlags secFlags = mLoadInfo->GetSecurityFlags() &
~nsILoadInfo::SEC\_FORCE\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL;
in nsBaseChannel::Redirect, does that fix the problem?

With this change, AFAICT the JS no longer runs. It's hard to be 100% sure because of the timeout, which means the testcase feels like it'll be a bit racy, but actually it's 100% reproducible for me on beta, and 0% reproducible after this change, when testing on self-compiled nightly. So I suspect you're right. Please needinfo if it'd be helpful for me to poke at this more (e.g. stacks for how we're hitting this case for this exploit) and I'll try and answer any questions tomorrow if that's helpful.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

OK, I thought about it more, and I can reproduce this bug on Mac too. All I have to do is make sure that p.desktop is in the \_parent\_ of the directory that houses spoof.html, so that normally the load of p.desktop would \_not\_ inherit the principal. The use of xor instead of &~ means the inherit bit gets added in that situation...

Be more careful about removing the inherit principal bit on base channel redirects
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Good question. Probably pretty easily if you know how this codepath is hit and how our file security model works.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Not as far as I could avoid. I did explicitly talk about removing the bit, but I assume anyone who sees fooo & ~bar will know that anyway.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
45esr, 48, 49, 50, 51.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should be a trivial backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This seems pretty safe to me. Minimal testing is probably OK.

Daniel, note that this bug basically allows file:// stuff to violate our security model for file://. Place a .url/.desktop file in a dir pointing to an arbitrary file, have a file in a \_child\_ of that dir that links to that .url/.desktop, load that file from the child dir, and suddenly you are same-origin with the arbitrary file the .url/.desktop links to.
So it may be worth taking this in a security update to 48, unless there simply isn't time for one before 49 ships anyway.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

[User impact if declined]: Allows files to attack other files on the hard drive
in ways they shouldn't be able to do, in addition to creating spoofing risks.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Test coverage is lacking for
file:// stuff.
[Risks and why]: I think this is pretty low risk, but since this is a regression
from what we thought was a low-risk fix...

Generally sec-high or sec-critical unless a special case is made. We don't take moderate or low rated issues on the ESR branch normally for stability reasons.

Dan is the one who rated it sec-moderate so you would need to ask him why it isn't a high if you think it is misrated. Otherwise, policy is that we don't take moderate or low bugs on ESR.

This was already marked "49+", because on security grounds it does. "sec-moderate" doesn't mean "we never take it on ESR", it means we judge it case-by-case. The download requirement lessens the mass-pwnage possibilities (thus not "high"), but the impact to affected individuals can still be severe.
Looks like it's too late for 49 (RC already shipped, this isn't a re-spin type fix) so I'll move the ESR to match "50+", but we do still want it on ESR just as we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR.

Yes, we have to draw a line somewhere for ESR. As Al said, sec-high and sec-moderate.
If you think that the risk is high enough to take it into ESR, we should probably bump the severity.Flags: needinfo?(sledru)

Well, I can't tell, because our severity ratings are all web-site-centric and don't really address the threat vector being a local file.
In this case, the attack would involve placing a specially crafted .desktop/.url file on the users disk, so maybe it's not that dangerous. I just can't tell. Do we consider a file on a network drive reading arbitrary files off your hard disk a sec-moderate or a sec-high?

We do take exceptions to this policy. The dev or someone else just makes a case for it normally. I didn't realize Dan had wanted it. Bumping the severity isn't really a solution as it messes up our rating system, which is not "make this more severe so we'll take it on ESR." The ratings have specific meanings (as much as possible).

Additionally, as Dan said in [comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c30 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), we took [bug 1278013](/show_bug.cgi?id=1278013 "RESOLVED FIXED - Same origin policy bypass in local document/Universal xss") on ESR, which was also sec-moderate rated and involved a similar-ish problem. This bug is a direct regression from that bug, and so arguably as a regression that we uplifted to ESR, the fix for that regression should be uplifted as well, particularly because it is a security issue that, as noted in [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1292159#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox V48.0 UXSS & Address Bar Spoofing"), is reasonably "obvious" given both the commit here and the previous fix which was already CVE'd and made public as fixed in earlier versions of ESR.

# SLOTH

## Security Losses from Obsolete and Truncated Transcript Hashes (CVE-2015-7575)

* [**Technical Paper:** *Transcript Collision Attacks: Breaking Authentication in TLS, IKE, and SSH*](/downloads/transcript-collisions.pdf), Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent, Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2016)

### TL;DR

If your TLS 1.2 client or server supports RSA-MD5 signatures, then client authentication
is broken, and server authentication may be breakable by a powerful adversary.
(Note the signature algorithm is not related to the chosen ciphersuite;
you may use ECDHE\_RSA\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256 and still be signing with RSA-MD5.)
If your TLS application relies on the tls-unique channel binding to prevent
credential forwarding, you need to redesign your application.
If practical collision attacks on SHA1 appear, then many constructions in
TLS, IKE, and SSH will be breakable. So, if you can afford to do so, get
rid of MD5 and SHA1 in all your protocol configurations.

## Introduction

In response to recent high-profile attacks that exploit hash function
collisions, software vendors have started to phase out the use of MD5 and SHA1
in third-party digital signature applications such as X.509 certificates.
However, weak hash functions continue to be used in
various cryptographic constructions within mainstream protocols such
as TLS, IKE, and SSH, because practitioners argue that their use in
these protocols relies only on second preimage resistance, and hence
is unaffected by collisions. We systematically investigate and debunk this argument.

We identify a new class of *transcript collision* attacks on
popular cryptographic protocols such as TLS, IKE, and SSH, that
significantly reduce their expected security. Our attacks rely on the
use of obsolete hash constructions in these protocols. The full
details of our attacks are in the [technical paper](/downloads/transcript-collisions.pdf).
This page summarizes our results and describes two concrete attacks on
TLS: one on [TLS 1.2 client authentication](#tls-client-auth), and the
[other on
the tls-unique channel binding](#tls-channel-bindings) used in various
TLS-based authentication protocols
like [Token
Binding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tokbind/charter/), [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-uaf-v1.0-ps-20141208/fido-uaf-protocol-v1.0-ps-20141208.html),
and [SCRAM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802).

Our main conclusion is that the continued use of MD5 and SHA1 in
mainstream cryptographic protocols significantly reduces their
security and, in some cases, leads to practical attacks on key
protocol mechanisms. Furthermore, the use of truncated hashes and
MACs for authenticating key exchange protocol transcripts is dangerous
and should be avoided where possible.

Partly as a consequence of this work, the TLS working group has
decided to remove RSA-MD5 signatures and truncated handshake hashes
from TLS 1.3. We encourage TLS 1.2 implementations to disable MD5
signatures immediately and SHA1 signatures as soon as practical. We
also advocate that tls-unique should no longer be used for
channel binding in application-layer authentication protocols.

### Why SLOTH?

SLOTH is an acronym for the loss of security
due to the use of obsolete and truncated hash constructions in
mainstream Internet protocols. SLOTH is also a not-so-subtle reference
to laziness in the protocol design community with regard to removing
legacy cryptographic constructions. For example, MD5 signatures have
been known to be cryptographically broken since at least 2005, but
they continue to be used in TLS today, when collision attacks have
become significantly more practical, even on standard desktop
workstations. Furthermore, SLOTH is part of a series of recent
attacks on the use of legacy crypto constructions including [POODLE](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf), [FREAK](/pages/attacks/SMACK) and [Logjam](http://weakdh.org). We hope that these attacks will
encourage the protocol community to proactively remove known-weak
constructions, rather than waiting for concrete attacks to make it necessary.

## SLOTH in TLS, IKE, and SSH

The following table summarizes the security losses (SLOTH) due to
transcript collision attacks on well-known cryptographic protocols. In
each protocol, we identify a protocol mechanism and a rough estimate
of its expected security. For example, if a TLS server uses a 3072-bit
RSA key for signing and supports SHA-256 as a hash algorithm, the
expected security of server signatures is 128 bits. Even if the server
supports MD5 signatures, since the 2nd preimage attack complexity of
MD5 signatures is still 2128, one may expect 128-bit
security for server signatures. However, in our paper, we describe a
transcript collision attack on TLS server signatures that takes
264 connections, 264 storage, and 264
hashes per connection. Hence, the effective security is halved to
about 64 bits. The security losses for other mechanisms such as TLS
client authentication are even more dramatic, leading to practical
attacks on real-world clients and servers.

## An attack on TLS 1.2 Client Authentication

In TLS, the client authenticates itself by presenting an X.509 certificate and then
signing a hash of the entire handshake transcript (up to that point) with the private key
corresponding to the certificate. In TLS versions up to 1.1, the hash algorithm
used before signing was a concatenation of MD5 and SHA1. However, TLS 1.2 allowed
clients and servers to negotiate the signature and hash algorithms they support.
This enabled the use of newer, stronger hash algorithms such as SHA-256 and SHA-512, but
unfortunately it also enabled the use of weaker hash algorithms such as MD5.

Indeed, we find that the TLS libraries in Java (SunJSSE) and on Akamai Servers
support RSA-MD5 signatures for both client and server authentication.
Even implementations that do not advertise support for RSA-MD5, such as
NSS (before version 3.21), BouncyCastle (Java before version 1.54, C# before version 1.8,1),
PolarSSL/mbedTLS (before 2.2.1), GnuTLS (before version 3.3.15),
and OpenSSL (before version 1.0.1f) surprisingly accept RSA-MD5 signatures.

### Man-in-the-Middle Client Impersonation Attack

Suppose a TLS client C and server S both support RSA-MD5 signatures for
client authentication, and suppose that the client is willing to
use the same certificate to authenticate at some malicious server M.
The figure below shows how M can mount a man-in-the-middle
transcript collision attack that allows it to impersonate C at S.

![](/i/tls-client-auth-mitm.png)

To accomplish this attack, the attacker M must compute a chosen-prefix
MD5 collision between two handshake transcripts, one between C and M,
and the other between M and S. The attack complexity depends on the
difficulty of finding such collisions. For MD5, such collisions are
known to require computing 239 hashes, which can be accomplished
in[several hours on Amazon EC2 instances](http://natmchugh.blogspot.com/2015/02/create-your-own-md5-collisions.html).

### Proof of Concept Demo

We implemented our man-in-the-middle attack between a standard Java
TLS client and a Java TLS server. We captured the handshake traces and
modified them as shown in the figure above. We used the publicly
available [HashClash](https://marc-stevens.nl/p/hashclash/)
software (with some optimizations we implemented) to compute the MD5
collision needed to complete the attack. After our optimizations,
computing the collision took only 1 hour on a workstation with 48 cores. We expect
that this time can be significantly reduced using a full GPU implementation
of HashClash, or custom MD5 hardware.

## An attack on TLS Channel Bindings

Application-layer user authentication protocols
such as SASL, EAP, and GSSAPI are vulnerable to generic credential forwarding attacks,
where an authentication credential sent by a client C to a server M may then be used
by M to impersonate C at another server S. (Note that our attack on TLS client
authentication has the same flavour.) To prevent such credential forwarding attacks,
modern authentication protocols rely on *channel bindings*.
For example, protocols like
[Token Binding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tokbind/charter/)
and [SCRAM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802) (used in [XMPP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120))
use the tls-unique channel identifier provided by the TLS layer
to strongly bind authentication credentials to the underlying channel,
so that a credential received on one TLS channel cannot be forwarded on another.

The tls-unique channel binding is defined as the first Finished
message sent in a TLS handshake. We observe that the TLS Finished message
in all versions up to TLS 1.2 is computed as the HMAC, using a session secret,
of the hash of the full handshake transcript. Importantly, this HMAC is
truncated to 96 bits, even in TLS 1.2 where the transcript hash and the
HMAC both use SHA-256. This use of a truncated hash enables a transcript
collision attack as described below.

### Man-in-the-Middle Credential Forwarding Attack

Suppose a client C and a server S use the tls-unique channel
binding to bind a user authentication credential to the TLS channel.
Further assume that the client is willing to use the same authentication
credential with a malicious server M. M will then connect to S and try
to forwards C's credential to S. The figure below shows how M
can synchronize the tls-unique on both connections and
successfully carry out this credential forwarding attack.

![](/i/tls-unique-mitm.png)

To accomplish this attack the attacker M needs to collide two ClientFinished
messages, one between C-M and the other between M-S. Two key observations make
this attack possible. First, the attacker knows the session master secret on
both connections and hence can compute the MAC. Second, the attacker controls
large parts of the transcripts in both directions and hence can try many
values to obtain the collision. Since the HMAC is only 96 bits long, even
a generic collision requires only about 248 HMAC computations.

### Proof of Concept Demo

We implemented our man-in-the-middle attack between a Google Chrome
client and the Google.com TLS server. We captured the handshake traces and
modified them as shown in the figure above. We implemented a TLS 1.1 Finished collision
search algorithm for Nvidia GPUs (using the CUDA framework).
Computing the collision took about 80 GPU days (20 days on a workstation with with 4 Nvidia Tesla GPUs).
This work can easily be parallelized across more GPUs to arbitrarily reduce the computation
time, and dedicated hardware would bring a significant speedup.

## Impact on TLS 1.2 and 1.3 Server Authentication

TLS 1.2 enables RSA-MD5 signatures for both client and server
signatures. Indeed, about [30% of HTTPS servers are currently willing to send RSA-MD5 server
signatures.](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/november-2015-scan-results/) However, the server signature in TLS 1.2 is not over the full
handshake transcript; it covers only the client and server
nonces and the server's Diffie-Hellman key share. This means that,
compared to client authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker is much more
limited when trying to exploit a server signature collision.

To mount a transcript collision attack on TLS 1.2 server authentication,
an attacker first has to collect a large number, say 2X, of
RSA-MD5 signatures signed by the server. The attacker may do this by
passively observing RSA-MD5 connections to the server, but since such
connections may be rare, it may have to actively connect to the server
to obtain a sufficient number of signatures.
Once these signatures (and their hashed contents) have been collected
and stored, the attacker can hijack any connection to the server
by choosing a server random such that the hash of the attacker's
key exchange message collides with one of the server signatures already
collected. Finding this collision requires the attacker to
compute up to 2128-X MD5 hashes and then
look them up in the stored signature database.

The complexity of the attack on TLS 1.2 server authentication
is therefore 2128-X MD5 hashes per connection,
in addition to 2X connections peformed before-hand, and 2X storage.
The attacker can trade-off between these costs---the more signatures he can collect, the less
he has to compute per connection. For example, if it is feasible to collect 264
signatures, then the per-connection cost is 264 hashes.

### Removing MD5 from TLS 1.3

In TLS 1.3, the server signature has been modified to cover the full handshake transcript.
Consequently, the transcript collision attack becomes as practical as the attack on TLS 1.2
client authentication. That is, if a TLS 1.3 client and server were to support
RSA-MD5 signatures, then a server impersonation attack can be mounted
with about 239 MD5 computations per connection. Considering that
server authentication is one of the main goals of TLS, this attack would have been devastating.
Fortunately, in response to comments from TLS practitioners and researchers, and partly
as a consequence of our work, all MD5 signatures have been disabled from TLS 1.3.
However, in light of previous bugs in TLS libraries that allowed legacy crypto
even after it was thought to be disabled, we warn that TLS implementations
must take special care to ensure that MD5 signatures are not enabled in TLS 1.3 connections.
Furthermore, we warn that the use of SHA1-based signatures in TLS 1.3 also reduces
its security significantly, and should be quickly deprecated.

## Affected Software and Responsible Disclosure

Our attack on MD5-based signatures affects all TLS clients and
servers that support RSA-MD5 and ECDSA-MD5 (DSA is typically enabled
only with SHA1). This protocol-level flaw in TLS 1.2 is covered
by [CVE-2015-7575](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7575).
Here is the list of software known to be affected. This list will evolve as we gather more information.

* OpenSSL clients and servers up to version 1.0.1e advertise,
  send, and accept RSA-MD5 signatures. Consequently applications
  that use this version are vulnerable, including those that rely
  on the default system OpenSSL on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and
  7, Debian Wheezy, Android 4.4.2 and 5.0.0, and Akamai GHost
  servers.

  (Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1f. Fixed on all Akamai servers on 17th Dec 2015.
  [Fixed in RHEL 6 and 7 on 6th January 2016 via updates to the OpenSSL, NSS, and GnuTLS packages.](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1289841))
* NSS clients (but not servers) up to version 3.20 accept RSA-MD5 server signatures
  even though clients do not offer RSA-MD5 in the ClientHello. This affects all
  versions of Firefox up to 42.

  ([Fixed in NSS version 3.21, Firefox 43](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1158489).)
* Oracle Java clients and servers up to version 8u66 (and 7u79) advertise, send, and accept RSA-MD5 client
  and server signatures.

  (Fixed in main codeline on 23rd December 2015, scheduled for a future CPU)
* GnuTLS clients and servers up to version 3.3.14 accept RSA-MD5 signatures even
  if the client or server disables them (using the priority string, for example).

  ([Fixed in 3.3.15 - GNUTLS-SA-2015-2](http://www.gnutls.org/security.html))
* BouncyCastle Java clients up to version 1.53 (C# clients up to 1.8.0) accept RSA-MD5 server signatures
  even if the client did not offer RSA-MD5 int he ClientHello.
  BouncyCastle servers up to the same versions may offer and accept RSA-MD5 signatures depending
  upon application configuration.

  (Fixed in Java version 1.54 and C# version 1.8.1)
* PolarSSL/mbedTLS up to 2.2.0 offers and accepts
  RSA-MD5 and ECDSA-MD5 signatures for server (but not client)
  authentication in its default configuration.

  (Fixed in mbedTLS 2.2.1, 2.1.4, 1.3.16.)
* Other TLS libraries are being tested. If you know of any TLS library
  that supports RSA-MD5, please let us know at the contacts below.
* Internet scans by Hubert Kario show that [32% of TLS servers support RSA-MD5 signatures](https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2015/12/07/november-2015-scan-results/) as of November 2015.

Our attack on the tls-unique channel binding affects application-level protocols
that rely on this channel binding to prevent credential forwarding attacks.
In general, all uses of tls-unique are suspect, but the following are known to be
specifically affected:

* [SCRAM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802) is used in SASL and GSSAPI and relies
  on tls-unique for channel binding. SCRAM is the default authentication protocol for [XMPP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120).
* [Token Binding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tokbind/charter/) is designed to
  protect HTTP cookies and OAuth tokens. It used to rely on tls-unique in [draft-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tokbind-protocol-01)
  but in response to our findings, it now relies on a different mechanism since [draft-02](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tokbind-protocol-02).
* [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-uaf-v1.0-ps-20141208/fido-uaf-protocol-v1.0-ps-20141208.html) supports tls-unique for channel bindings.
* If you know of other protocols that rely on tls-unique please inform us on the contacts below.

As agl notes in [0] the divSpoiler hack to avoid CPU optimisation and thus timing side channels isn't working. We have the same code [1] that we should replace with something similar (Barrett reduction sounds like a good choice).

As a general suggestion, I recommend to mention affected function names, as links with line numbers, that don't refer to a specific revision, will get outdated very quickly.

Looks good: I've verified that the ranges are sufficient for removing the padding lengths we need to deal with, and that they are right.

This notation is pretty opaque. It's equivalent to an ssl\_constantTimeSelect, right? If so, that would be clearer.

Which Firefox branches need this fix?

This bug fixes what ought to be fixed in [bug 822365](/show_bug.cgi?id=822365 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-constant time CBC decoding results in padding oracle (Lucky Thirteen attack)"). So the exploit is known for about 4 years already. Though the code changed considerably as a result of [bug 822365](/show_bug.cgi?id=822365 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-constant time CBC decoding results in padding oracle (Lucky Thirteen attack)") such that it's not immediately clear to me if/how the original attack still works. It'll land with 3.27 and and such be in Firefox 51.
Dan, do we want to backport the fix to other Firefox versions? I think an uplift to 50 would be reasonable. Not sure about 49 and ESR.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

This looks like a small part of the fix in [bug 822365](/show_bug.cgi?id=822365 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-constant time CBC decoding results in padding oracle (Lucky Thirteen attack)"). Does this flawed timing attack defense (which seemed to work OK at the time) really defeat the whole of the Lucky13 defense? I'm guessing sec-moderate is more appropriate, but if this does resurrect Lucky13 then we should go back to sec-high.
If it's sec-high we should definitely push for Firefox 49 (NSS 3.25?) -- we still have a week or two. If it's sec-moderate and we're still mostly safe from lucky13 then 50 is probably OK. Either way we'll want this on the ESR release that matches when it ships.

Based on comments from Dan and Liz, it seems the request is to fix this
for Firefox 50, and ESR 45.5, scheduled for 2016-11-08
Firefox 50 will require a backport of the fix to NSS\_3\_26\_BRANCH and a NSS 3.26.1 release.
ESR 45.5 will require a backport of the fix to NSS\_3\_21\_BRANCH and a NSS 3.21.2 release.
Franziskus, is the patch compatible with those older branches (in other words, your patch doesn't depend on anything else that has been added after the release of NSS 3.21.1) ?Flags: needinfo?(franziskuskiefer)

Regarding branch landing timing, I suggest that we land the updated NSS branch releases into the mozilla-beta and mozilla-esr45 branches, shortly after 2016-09-13.
Dan, Liz, does that work for you? Will be give branch commit approvals by mid september?Flags: needinfo?(lhenry)

We aren't 100% sure of the release date right now. Probably 2016-09-13, but we have a little uncertainty right now that we may need to slip the date. Landing after we release should be ok. Dan, what do you think?

Merge attempt for NSS 3.21 branch.
I was testing on Fedora 24 with gcc 6.1.1, and I ran into a warning-as-error, misleading indentation.
I suggest to disable that error on the old branch, which doesn't have our code reformatting yet.

Regarding the announcement of the NSS 3.21.2 and NSS 3.26.1 releases:
When are we allowed to send the public announcement message for those NSS security fix releases?
I'd like to land the code into Firefox beta and ESR 45 as soon as possible (soon after the mit-september releases are done), and this will require me to make the new NSS releases publicly available on FTP/S3 (which means people will find them).
Should the NSS announcement be sent immediately, with a vague text - or -
should the NSS version annoucement be delayed until some later date?
(If yes, please suggest the date.)

For the lines that trigger the warning we have
if ()
action();
However, those two lines start with a different mixed amount of tabs and spaces. The compiler apparently wants to warn that the indenting might mislead a human reader.

Are you landing "final" versions on the "beta" branch, and thus triggering what looks like an NSS "release"? Why so early in the cycle? If we need testing could we land these as "beta" versions of NSS and then change the definition (header value) to final later in the cycle?
How has this not come up before? We've fixed NSS bugs in the past and not released advisories for them until that version of Firefox was released.
> Should the NSS announcement be sent immediately, with a vague text - or -
What else is being fixed in these versions?

The tracking flags mean tracking, nothing more. When a patch for a tracked bug is produced then the approval process is there to give release managers a chance to make sure the actual patch isn't too complicated/risky/untested/late for a given milestone.

Correct.

I just assumed you want all changes to mozilla-beta happening as early as possible.

We could. What's the deadline for landing the final header version changes (and configure update to require the new version number) into the mozilla-beta and mozilla-esr45 branches?
We should start by testing with mozilla-central immediately, by uplifting a new NSS 3.27 beta to m-i today, I'll work to get this done. (It might have been a good idea to do this immediately after this fix landed into NSS trunk.)
> How has this not come up before? We've fixed NSS bugs in the past and not

Not sure I understand the question. Yes, situations like that had been come up before. I made my comment to ensure everyone is aware of these needs for timing the announcements.

> What else is being fixed in these versions?
Nothing else. The proposal is to produce security NSS releases, which are based on the currently used NSS branch releases used by the respective Firefox branches, plus this fix.
(These days we have one NSS branch for each Firefox branch.)
> The tracking flags mean tracking, nothing more.
Thanks for the clarification. We'll make attachments for the approval process.

- the fix from this bug hasn't produced any issues with the NSS own test suite
- a try build with this fix has now been started here:
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=0a08925056fc>
(if try build succeeds, I'll uplift into mozilla-inbound by tomorrow)

backport to NSS 3.21, v1
Franziskus, the patch for NSS 3.21.x doesn't work with older gcc versions, apparently not on OSX. We need to limit -Wno-error=misleading-indentation to compiler versions that support it.

This patch is wrong. -Werror is fine for all versions of GCC and clang.
I suggest we simply remove -Wno-error=misleading-indentation. If an
NSS 3.21.x package needs to be built with the latest version of GCC,
the NSS 3.21.x package spec file should add -Wno-error=misleading-indentation.
We should not add such a change to an NSS branch without adding it to
the NSS trunk first.

That's why I made the second version of the patch, which keeps -Werror in general.

I don't intend to add this parameter to the NSS trunk. We don't need it there. We have reformatted our code on trunk, that prevents the error, and doesn't require the parameter.
This parameter is specifically suggested for the old NSS branch, where we shouldn't mess with cleaning up the bad whitespace.
Adding the patch to NSS directly is preferred, because this isn't just about creating NSS packages, but our continous integration includes systems that use gcc 6.

... and I'd like to build the NSS 3.21 release candidate on our continous integration infrastructure, just for completeness, to ensure all tests still pass on all platforms with this fix on that branch.

GCC documentation says:
In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses
the -ftabstop= option to determine if the statements
line up (defaulting to 8).
<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html>
NSS uses a tabstop of 8. So if GCC cannot handle that, we
should submit a bug report to GCC.

[incremental for nss 3.21, fix misleading indentation (patch v2)](attachment.cgi?id=8794355&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8794355&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1293334&attachment=8794355)

I updated my patch because Kai's patch has been checked in.
I hope the benefits of compiling NSS\_3\_21\_BRANCH with -Wmisleading-indentation
are clear.

Wan-Teh, I appreciate your intention to simplify, but let me say:
- I'm trying to minimize patches that backport security fixes as much as possible,
and white space changes in particular can usually create confusion very easily,
and distract from the real change
- I had not attempted to go the whitespace fixing approach in the first place,
because my expectation was that a much larger number of places might have
required fixing, so it's good that only very few places would need a fix.
- the benefit of the compiler warning seems negligible in this particular scenario,
because we know the code is correct, and we're not developing new code on this branch.
My preference is to keep things simple, and because buildbot seems to currently build fine with the code as checked in, avoiding additional commits seems simpler to me, so in my opinion your patch isn't necessary.
But if Franziskus thinks differently and prefers the whitespace cleanup and gives you r+, I'll check it in, and will have to trigger another round of test builds afterwards.

I was mainly curious about the speculation that -Wmisleading-indentation
cannot handle mixed tabs and spaces correctly. I found that GCC handles
mixed tabs and spaces correctly in all the four files it warns about.
\* The two files in lib/dbm/src/ use a tab stop of 4. The warnings could
also be fixed by compiling those files with the -ftabstop=4 option.
\* The other two files simply have incorrect indentations.
I'm glad I don't need to submit a bug report to GCC.
I also wanted to know if any of the incorrect indentations is a bug.
Fortunately none of them is. Without looking at the warnings, we cannot
be sure.
So, whether you accept my patch or not is secondary to me.

Wan-Teh, thanks a lot for your thorough verifications!
I'll defer to Franziskus if we should check this in, or can skip it.

Thanks a lot for the investigation Wan-Teh.
But since there's no bug I think we should leave the 3.21 branch alone.

Firefox 51 is already using NSS 3.27, which already contains the fix for this bug.
I'm flipping the bit to fixed.

Hi,
I am trying to understand if this is really a security flaw? I understand that barrett reduction is much better, but is the div\_spoiler implementation broken, ie it did not implement the fix correctly?
If not, that this is just security hardening and not a flaw imo

Yes this is a security flaw. See links [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293334#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Replace unreliable divSpoiler (timing side-channel defense)"), i.e. division on Intel CPUs is not constant time, which provides the attacker with a padding oracle.

I know, but the workaround to that is to use the divspoiler mechanism, which was used everywhere, barrett reduction is just the better way of doing it.

Note:
Just to clarify the above, i dont understand why a CVE id was assigned in the first place. barrett reduction is a much better way of doing constant-time operation, but div\_spoiler is not vulnerable in the first place (not perfect but not vulnerable).
So even that the older method isnt really vulnerable, this is not really a security issue.

No, this is not a security flaw. div\_spoiler solves the problem, its not perfect but works, barrett reduction is just a better way of doing things.

Not sure if this makes any difference now. I want to suggest we reject this CVE id. This is not a security flaw. div\_spoiler works well, barrett reduction is just a better method of handling things. This is an enhancement bug not a security flaw.

Huzaifa: I think you're missing the point. At the danger of repeating myself let me explain again what this bug is about.
The original code added the so called divSpoiler to |macStart - scanStart| in the hope that this would make CPUs compute |divq| operations in constant time. That's however not the case (at least not everywhere).
The new code, using barrett reduction, aims to bypass the problem of non-constant-time div operations on CPUs by not using it. Barrett instead only subtracts.
So this change has nothing to with enhancement but is fixing a security issue. Because observing timing differences in CPU instructions is relatively hard, this is sec-moderate.
