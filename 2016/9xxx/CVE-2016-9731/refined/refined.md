- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A responsive coach view in IBM Business Process Manager is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable responsive coach view.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attacker needs to have the ability to embed JavaScript code within the Web UI, likely requiring some level of access to the application or its configuration. User interaction (UI:R) is required to trigger the XSS, as the malicious script needs to be executed by the user's browser. The attacker must be a low-privileged user (PR:L) to exploit the vulnerability.
