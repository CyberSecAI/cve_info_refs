- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM QRadar SIEM and Incident Forensics Web UI does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that could alter the intended functionality of the Web UI. This can lead to spoofing attacks and potentially expose user credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI. The attacker must be able to insert this code into the application, likely through a user-controlled field or input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **For CVE-2016-9723:**  The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to interact with the crafted UI elements. The CVSS vector indicates a 'User Interaction' requirement. The attacker does not require any privileges.
    - **For CVE-2017-1133:** The attacker needs to have low privileges to use the application. The CVSS vector indicates a 'User Interaction' requirement.
