The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9048.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is improper sanitization of user-supplied input, which allows for SQL injection attacks. Specifically, multiple parameters in various URLs are vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in ProcessMaker Enterprise Core 3.0.1.7-community. These vulnerabilities stem from the application's failure to properly neutralize special elements used in SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes stored in the database, potentially leading to the exfiltration of the entire database. In certain scenarios, it may also allow access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities can be exploited through specially crafted web requests. Both authenticated and unauthenticated attack vectors are identified. The authenticated vulnerabilities are present in multiple GET and POST requests with injectable parameters like `sort`, `cat`, `node`, and `lang`. The unauthenticated vulnerability is present in the GET request to `gulliver/genericAjax` with injectable parameters `pk` and `table`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user of the application. 
- For the unauthenticated SQL injection, an attacker needs to know a valid database connection name (`cnn` parameter).
