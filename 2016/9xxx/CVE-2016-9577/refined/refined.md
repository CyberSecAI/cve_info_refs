Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-9577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `main_channel_alloc_msg_rcv_buf` function within the SPICE server's protocol handling. This occurs when reading large messages due to a missing buffer size check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The core issue is a heap overflow. Specifically, the `main_channel_alloc_msg_rcv_buf` function in SPICE doesn't properly validate the size of incoming messages, leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Missing Buffer Size Check:** The vulnerability arises due to the absence of a size check before allocating memory for received messages. This allows an attacker to send messages larger than what is allocated, causing a write beyond buffer boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the SPICE server process, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Possible Code Execution:** In some cases, the heap overflow could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated as the primary impact.
* **Remote DoS:** By sending a crafted message, an attacker could remotely crash the SPICE server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, targeting the SPICE server.
*   **Crafted Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted messages to the SPICE server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Attacker:** Initially it was thought that the attacker needed to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, but later information shows unauthenticated access could also cause a crash.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the SPICE server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).
*   The vulnerability affects various products using the SPICE protocol, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Virtualization, and Fedora.
*   The fix involves updating the `spice` package to version `0.12.4-20.el7_3` or higher for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, `0.12.4-13.el6_8.2` or higher for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and `0.13.90` for the spice package as a general fix, including a proper buffer size check.
* The fix was included in the RHSA-2017:0253, RHSA-2017:0254, RHSA-2017:0549 and RHSA-2017:0552 errata.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-9577 describes a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the SPICE server related to how it handles incoming messages. A malicious, potentially authenticated, attacker, by sending a specially crafted message can crash the server, and potentially execute arbitrary code. This has been addressed in the mentioned errata by adding a proper size check for messages received.
