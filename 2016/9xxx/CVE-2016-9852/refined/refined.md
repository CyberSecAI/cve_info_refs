Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of PHP errors within phpMyAdmin scripts. When certain scripts are called in an unexpected manner or during an execution timeout in the export functionality, PHP error messages are generated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** These error messages inadvertently reveal the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is **information disclosure**. An attacker can learn the exact file system path of the phpMyAdmin installation on the server.
- This information can be used for further attacks as it would allow an attacker to understand the layout of the server, this in turn may assist in other types of attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unexpected Script Calls:**  Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by calling specific phpMyAdmin scripts in ways they were not intended to be used.
- **Export Timeout:** The full path is revealed in errors written to the export file when an export operation times out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable phpMyAdmin installation.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement to trigger the vulnerability. However the export timeout is likely to require an attacker to initiate an export process (requires some level of access).

**Affected Versions:**
- phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x prior to 4.6.5 and 4.4.x prior to 4.4.15.9 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical by the phpMyAdmin team, suggesting that it does not lead to direct compromise, however this type of information disclosure can assist an attacker with other types of attacks
