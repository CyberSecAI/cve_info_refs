\* To determine the core product version, log in and view System Information. The core product version is the "Tivoli's process automation engine" version. Please consult the [Product Coexistence Matrix](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Maximo%20Asset%20Management/page/Product%20compatibility) for a list of supported product combinations.

## Remediation/Fixes

This can only be fixed by a manual configuration change outlined in the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

This vulnerability can be exploited in the automation scripts created in the Automation Scripts application. While itâ€™s typical for clients to give limited access to the Automation Scripts application, it is recommended that clients limit user access to the Automation Scripts application to trusted users on an as needed basis. Clients can do this by removing access to the Automation Scripts application for all security groups. To grant access, create a new security group, give the group access to the Automation Scripts application and then add the user(s) that need to create scripts. Since automation scripts are used for customizing Maximo, and are typically created and tested in development/staging environments, no users in a production environment should really need access to the Automation Scripts application. You can find additional information on Maximo Security groups in the IBM Knowledge Center: <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter>.
