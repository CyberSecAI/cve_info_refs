Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an information exposure issue within the SIMATIC S7-300 and S7-400 PLCs when Protection-Level 2 is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):**  The PLC exposes sensitive information (credentials) when accessed via Port 102/TCP (ISO-TSAP) or through Profibus if protection level 2 is configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain credentials from the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the PLC via:
    *   Port 102/TCP (ISO-TSAP)
    *   Profibus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the PLC to exploit this vulnerability.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability since the vulnerability is exploitable via network access and does not require authentication.
*   The PLC needs to have "Protection Level 2" configured for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various SIMATIC S7-300 and S7-400 CPU families, including SIPLUS variants.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5.
*   Siemens recommends using protection level 3, cell protection concepts, and defense-in-depth strategies to mitigate this issue.
*   Specific mitigations for SIMATIC S7-CPU 410 include activating Field Interface Security in PCS 7 V9.0 and using a CP 443-1 Adv. to communicate with ES/OS.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*   There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
