Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `libImaging/Storage.c` file of the Pillow library.
*   Specifically, the `ImagingNew` function in `Storage.c` was accepting negative values for image dimensions (xsize, ysize) without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `ImagingNew` function failed to check if the provided image size arguments (xsize and ysize) were non-negative.
*   **Memory Error:** By accepting negative values for image size, the code could lead to memory corruption due to incorrect memory allocation calculations, resulting in a memory error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted image with negative dimensions could trigger a memory error leading to the application crashing.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated in this document, memory corruption issues can potentially be exploited by a skilled attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker could craft a malicious image file (e.g., a PPM file as seen in the test case) with negative dimensions.
*   **Processing by Pillow:** When a vulnerable application uses the Pillow library to process this malicious image, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious image to an application that uses the vulnerable version of Pillow. This could be through a website, email attachments, or other methods.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check in `ImagingNew` to ensure `xsize` and `ysize` are not negative, causing the function to return an error if negative values are supplied.
*   **Test Case:** A test case was added (`Tests/test_file_ppm.py`) that creates an image using  a PPM image (`Tests/images/negative_size.ppm`) with negative dimensions and verifies that an error is raised. This highlights the use of the PPM image format as a specific attack vector for this particular issue.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201612-52) indicates that Pillow versions before 3.4.2 are affected. The advisory lists CVE-2016-9190 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the update, which is categorized as having local and remote exploitability.
*   **Debian:** Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3710-1) also references CVE-2016-9190 and indicates the vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.6.1-2+deb8u3 for stable (jessie), and in 3.4.2-1 for testing (stretch) and unstable (sid).

In summary, the core of this vulnerability lies in the lack of input validation, specifically with regards to negative image dimensions, which can cause a memory error. An attacker can trigger this by supplying a malicious image file with crafted dimensions.
