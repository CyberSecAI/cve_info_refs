â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8814034&action=edit)

Note: I am reporting this issue here rather than to Pocket because Pocket is an integral part of Firefox and cannot be disabled or removed by regular means.
The bubble displayed by the Pocket toolbar button is actually an <iframe> loading from either about:pocket-signup or about:pocket-saved. In order to communicate with that frame the Pocket extension registers event listeners on browser.xul's document, accepting untrusted events. The event listeners don't do anything to verify the origin of the event so that events bubbling up from the browser's content area will be processed as well.
Steps to reproduce (I tested with Firefox 53.0a1 nightly 2016-11-23 on macOS 10.12):
1. Make sure that E10S is disabled (with E10S events from content won't bubble up to the browser).
2. Click the Pocket button to make sure that the extension is initialized. It doesn't matter whether anything happens after that, you don't need to sign up with Pocket.
3. Now open the attached webpage in Firefox and click the "Open about:preferences with Sync tab selected".
This button will open about:preferences#sync page, something that web pages normally cannot do. Pop-up blocker doesn't affect this, so websites can open any number of pop-ups at any time this way. Security checks don't apply either so opening arbitrary file:///, chrome:// or about: URLs is possible.
Note that this only abuses "openTabWithUrl" message that Pocket listens to. There is a number of other message listeners which might also have abuse potential - e.g. "deleteItem" message allows deleting items from Pocket. Note also that the website can detect when its attack was successful because the Pocket extension will remove the event target from the page.
Also, this issue is completely avoidable. There is only one Pocket frame in the browser document, the event listeners could be registered directly on that iframe element rather than on the document - this would make sure that no events from other sources will be received.

Eh, fairly sure that you can just right click the pocket button, click 'remove from toolbar', and that should stop all of this (if not immediately, certainly on the next restart). Also, most of this code was still written by pocket...
Shane, can you make sure we CC whoever needs to be CC'd from the pocket side on this?

Well, if you never click the Pocket button it will never initialize and my PoC won't work. But if you click it, and be it out of curiosity - removing it from the toolbar will no longer help you, for the current session you will be vulnerable.

I'm assuming I don't need to touch messages.js because it only runs \*inside\* the iframes for messages/events going in the other direction. That said, I wonder if you could frame those documents using their chrome URIs and then manipulate them that way :| .

Given [bug 1320057](/show_bug.cgi?id=1320057 "VERIFIED FIXED - Remote code execution vulnerability in Pocket extension") it's probably a good thing that they are accessed via about: URIs that drop all privileges.
Note that changing removeMessageListener() is pointless - it is dead code not being called anywhere and it wouldn't work anyway (it removes the wrong function, not the closure added in addMessageListener). There is also quite a bit of unnecessary complexity in the surrounding code but that's irrelevant for this security issue.

They are in the iframe we use for the actual UI. But the pages have chrome:// URLs, e.g. chrome://pocket/content/panels/saved.html . They're contentaccessible too, presumably in order for the about: pages to be able to load all the other gunk. That still doesn't let you link to them, fortunately, and AIUI this vulnerability doesn't let you open URLs into arbitrary subframes - "just" in new tabs, which at least avoids then being able to spoof the messages back to these pages (like, say, the suggested tags) which you could then exploit to go other places in the now-system-privileged page you just opened. :|

I'm pretty sure that this is possible as long as a system-privileged script sets location.href.

Given that this is technically an extension and that the code is probably upstreamed to Pocket, is it a good idea to rely on implementation details like the global urlSecurityCheck function? Besides, just calling scriptSecurityManager directly wouldn't be significantly longer:
var secMan = Services.scriptSecurityManager;
secMan.checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal(data.url, contentPrincipal, secMan.DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL);

Hrmpf. Will file an orthogonal bug about that.

It also relies on openUILink / openLinkIn, I think? Which is in the same file. So I don't think that relying on this as well is fine.

Eh, too many negations. But yeah, I think this is fine, tbh.

Not actually the same thing - it's in the same file now because it moved there. This is documented API (<https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Codeschnipsel/Tabbed_browser#Opening_a_URL_in_the_correct_window.2Ftab>) and has been stable for a long time. Quite a few extensions rely on it already which is probably why it is still around in that form. urlSecurityCheck() is neither old nor documented.

It's documented to the extent that someone wrote a code snippet that uses it, but that says nothing about it being supported, or its use being good practice. In fact, the en-US version of that page was marked as obsolete because it suggested a lot of bad practices.
I don't think this is worth worrying about. checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal is no more of a public API than urlSecurityCheck, and it would be much easier to make changes to the latter (which is already used by many add-ons) without breaking compatibility than it would the former.

Patch v0.3
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-moderate, obvious html injection issue that might be remotely exploitable, trivial patch. I would be more sanguine about not having this on ESR if we weren't about to roll it into 50.1 giving adversaries 4 months to figure out how to exploit this together with 1320057 and other addon bugs into something higher severity (before it'll ship as part of 52esr)
User impact if declined: see above
Fix Landed on Version: 53
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): pretty low. The changes are straightforward. We should make sure they get tested on release/beta/aurora, of course.
Approval Request Comment
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Some basic automated tests cover stuff this code changes, but not in any great deapth, sadly.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet...
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
from [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1320039#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Pocket extension unnecessarily exposes its messaging interface to web pages"):
> Steps to reproduce (I tested with Firefox 53.0a1 nightly 2016-11-23 on macOS
> 10.12):
>
> 1. Make sure that E10S is disabled (with E10S events from content won't
> bubble up to the browser).
> 2. Click the Pocket button to make sure that the extension is initialized.
> It doesn't matter whether anything happens after that, you don't need to
> sign up with Pocket.
> 3. Now open the attached webpage in Firefox and click the "Open

In builds without the patch, the page will open. In builds with the patch, it shouldn't open.
The patch changes how some of the pocket internals function. The basic verification steps would amount to checking:
a) you can still successfully save pages in pocket
b) you can still tag them as you like
c) you can still remove pages once saved in pocket, as you would before.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: [bug 1320057](/show_bug.cgi?id=1320057 "VERIFIED FIXED - Remote code execution vulnerability in Pocket extension") is not necessary for this fix to work, but because both affect pocket and how easy it is to run code in its code, I would suggest both need uplift.
[Is the change risky?]: not very
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: well, the worst that could happen is that we break pocket's tagging system. Manual tests by me suggests this patch doesn't do that. It's also pretty straightforward.

This needs to be added to the 50.1 Firefox advisory and ESR 45.5.2 (or 45.6 since I don't think there is a 45.5.2 ESR release) after it ships in ESR.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Ok. My mistake, there is a 45.6 release so this can be added once that ships.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")â€Ž | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)

* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

|  | |

I honestly don't know if or how this exploitable, but the SDK bundles a world-accessible file with an intentional HTML injection vulnerability:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f5c9e9a249637c9abd88754c8963ecb3838475cb/addon-sdk/source/lib/sdk/ui/frame/view.html#17>
document.documentElement.innerHTML = atob(location.hash.substr(1));
This file is accessible to the entire web at resource://gre/modules/commonjs/sdk/ui/frame/view.html in the stock browser, and at various other locations in add-ons with bundled copies of the SDK. In the latter case, it can probably at the least be used to access the add-on's localStorage, or to trick unwary content scripts. It's probably exploitable in other ways too, though.

Jorge,
Can you please look into notifying the authors of AMO add-ons that bundle this file that they need to remove their bundled copies of the SDK, and block the ones that don't do so promptly? This could be an especially dangerous exploit in the case of add-ons that use localStorage or load content scripts into URLs belonging to their add-on.Flags: needinfo?(jorge)

Fix intentional, gaping XSS hole.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The patch should apply cleanly on all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely.

> Do we need to take this patch on branches?
Probably. I don't have a good proof of concept exploit for the in-tree version of this, but anyone who put in some effort probably could. The fix is fairly low-risk, in any case.

Fix intentional, gaping XSS hole.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: [Bug 787390](/show_bug.cgi?id=787390 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add Toolbar's components type")
[User impact if declined]: This is an easily exploitable XSS/privilege escalation vulnerability, but the potential impact is unclear.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: There are tests for this feature, but not for this security issue.
[Risks and why]: Low. This is a fairly simple change that removes a DOM to HTML to DOM round trip, and an accompanying security hole, but otherwise changes very little.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None.

web content can't link or open resource:// or chrome:// urls. How would this be exploited by web content? Do we have features that take arbitrary web content (from messages? urls?) and passes them to a frame containing this content?
IOW is this automatically a vulnerability, or is it a foot-gun that requires the add-on to also do something specific and probably ill-advised?

Hm. You're right, web content can only directly load the URLs as resources, not as documents, so I think it requires another vulnerability to exploit.

Hi Kris,
When you nominate the uplift request, aurora is 51, beta is for 50, and release is for 49. Since the merge days is passed, is this worth uplifting to 51 beta?

Yes. The issue isn't as severe as I originally thought, but it's still severe.

Yes. I canceled the aurora uplift request after the merge, but I'd still like to uplift to the other channels.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Is there necessary any manual testing around this bug? If yes, could you please provide some reliable steps? Or it would be preferable to perform exploratory testing around the add-ons mentioned in [Comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=1315435#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intentional XSS injection hole in add-ons SDK")?Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

There's probably not much point in manual testing. It might be a good idea to do some testing of add-ons that (directly or indirectly) use the ui/frame module, but if this were going to cause breakage there, we almost certainly have seen it by now.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)Whiteboard: [qa-]

I would prefer to keep the fixes for 50.0.1 release (planned to gtb and push this week) to a minimal set of required fixes. I think we should take this in the planned 50.1.0 release. Please let me know if there are any concerns.Flags: needinfo?(rkothari)

50.1.0 sounds fine to me.

Based on [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1315435#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intentional XSS injection hole in add-ons SDK"), dropping this to sec-moderate, since it should only be exploitable in combination with other vulnerabilities.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) â†’ [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)
