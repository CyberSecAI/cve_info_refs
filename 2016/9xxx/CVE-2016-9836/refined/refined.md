The provided content is related to CVE-2016-8869 and CVE-2016-8870, not CVE-2016-9836. However, since the content provides a detailed description of an exploit for the mentioned vulnerabilities in Joomla, here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient whitelisting of file extensions and content during file uploads in Joomla's `com_users:user.register` component. Specifically, while `.php` and `.phtml` extensions and files containing `<?php` are blocked, the code allows `<?=` and `.pht` files, which are still executable as PHP code on most servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate File Upload Whitelisting:** The system does not properly sanitize file extensions and content, allowing attackers to bypass upload restrictions.
*   **PHP Execution via `.pht` Extension:** The server configuration, often including a standard Ubuntu LAMP setup, treats `.pht` files as PHP files. This means that the uploaded `.pht` file is executed as PHP.
*   **`<?=` Short Tag Usage**: The server environment supports the `<?=` short tag to execute PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious `.pht` file containing PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to full server compromise, allowing attackers to access sensitive data, install malware, or further pivot into the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** Exploits the user registration functionality (`com_users:user.register`) in Joomla to upload a crafted `.pht` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Joomla website.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The exploit can be triggered through the public user registration functionality.
*   **Basic HTTP interaction:** The exploit is performed by sending HTTP requests to the Joomla server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided script `joomraa.py` automates the exploitation process, demonstrating how to register a user, log in as an administrator, upload the malicious file, and then execute it.
* The content mentions that the exploit works "out of the box" on most hosting environments, making it a potentially widespread issue.
* The `FilesMatch` directive shown highlights the configuration issue that allows the `.pht` extension to be processed by PHP.
