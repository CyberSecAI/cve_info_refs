      "entries": 11
    },
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the ALSA pcm layer.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Race condition when calling kill_fasync() outside the stream lock.",
        "Potential for the stream to be released while the IRQ handler is still running.",
        "fasync data pointer not handled correctly when freeing the runtime structure."
      ],
      "Impact": "A local user may cause a denial of service, memory corruption, or possibly privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access to the system is required.",
		"Crafted SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_START command."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to execute code on the target system.",
		"Ability to write to /dev/sg or /dev/bsg device to exploit the use-after-free in scsi generic driver (CVE-2016-9576)"
      ],
	  "Affected components" : [
	  	"ALSA pcm layer"
	  ],
    "Additional Information": [
        "The fasync interface is rarely used.",
		"Fix for this vulnerability was backported to multiple kernel branches."
