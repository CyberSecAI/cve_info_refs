Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the mentioned CVE:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   The commit message "Fix #3847 : sécuriser exec plonger" suggests a security fix related to the `exec` function and specifically the `plonger` functionality within the SPIP framework. This type of fix often involves sanitizing user input or preventing code injection vulnerabilities, making it plausible that this commit addresses a CVE. However, the provided commit message doesn't explicitly refer to CVE-2016-9152. Further evidence would be needed to confirm the link.

**2. Vulnerability Details (Extracted from the provided content):**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The commit message indicates that the vulnerability lies within the `exec` function, specifically concerning its `plonger` functionality. `plonger` suggests a feature related to immersion or deep execution, but more context is needed to fully understand its function. The commit message also notes "merci à xiaoL pour le signalement", meaning that the vulnerability was reported by someone named xiaoL.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core issue is a lack of security in how the `exec` function handles the `plonger` feature, which likely leads to a code injection vulnerability, especially if user-supplied data is processed by this function without proper sanitization or validation.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** The exploitation of such a vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to various impacts, such as:
      - Data breaches.
      - Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
      - Server compromise.
      - Defacement of the website.
      - Denial of Service.
   - **Attack Vectors:** The attacker would likely need to provide malicious input through a vector that interacts with the `exec plonger` functionality. Without the specific code, it is difficult to identify the exact method of injection, but common entry points are:
      - URL parameters
      - POST data
      - Uploaded files
      - Database entries

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `exec plonger` function with malicious input. Their position would need to have access to a point in the application where that interaction is possible.  This may mean being a logged-in user or, in some cases, an anonymous visitor to the site.

**Summary**
The provided content relates to a security vulnerability in SPIP, specifically around the `exec` function and the `plonger` feature. This likely involves code injection due to a lack of input sanitization when processing `plonger`. The impact of exploitation could be severe, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the server. The attacker would require the ability to interact with the vulnerable function with malicious input.

Based on the information available, we can hypothesize the vulnerability involves injection through `exec` and its `plonger` parameter. To confirm whether this relates to CVE-2016-9152 or not, further investigation using the CVE ID would be necessary. However, the provided commit message suggests a similar class of security vulnerability.
