- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `jsC_dumpfunction` function due to an incorrect index (`c`) being used to access the `opname` array. The value of `c` can exceed the bounds of the array, causing a read beyond the allocated memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure, as the attacker can read arbitrary memory contents.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted Javascript bytecode that results in an out-of-bounds access during the debugging dump process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to supply the vulnerable application with malicious bytecode that will cause the `jsC_dumpfunction` function to read beyond the bounds of the `opname` array.
