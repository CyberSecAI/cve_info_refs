  "cve_id": "CVE-2016-9150",
  "description": "Palo Alto Networks web management server improperly handles a buffer overflow. This can result in a possible remote code execution (RCE). An attacker with network access to the management web interface may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) or denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `mprItoa` function of the `appweb3` embedded web server. The `size` parameter, intended to represent the buffer size, is not properly validated, leading to a write beyond the buffer's boundary by one byte for a null terminator when the converted value exceeds the provided size.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) or denial-of-service (DoS). The vulnerability can corrupt memory, such as the GOT pointer, leading to unexpected routine calls and potential crashes.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "Network access to the management web interface."
