The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9263.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-domain Flash injection (XSF) issue within the `flashmediaelement.swf` file, part of the MediaElement.js library used by WordPress. This file incorrectly uses `Security.allowDomain("www.[XYZ].com")`, allowing any Flash file hosted on `www.[XYZ].com` to execute code within the security context of the WordPress site. The domain `www.[XYZ].com` was vulnerable to Cross-Site Flashing (XSF) allowing an attacker to chain the vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary code execution on the WordPress site.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Flashing (XSF):** The core issue is that the `flashmediaelement.swf` file uses `Security.allowDomain` with a third-party domain (`www.[XYZ].com`) which is vulnerable to XSF. This grants the third-party domain's flash content the same permissions as the WordPress site.
2.  **Insecure Flash-to-Javascript communication:** When the `ogVideoType` is set to "video/flv", the `flashmediaelement.swf` sends javascript code to the webpage using `setTimeout('log("[VIDEO_URL]")', 0)` where `[VIDEO_URL]` is attacker controlled. The `absolutizeUrl` function, which normalizes the URL, behaves differently across browsers. Specifically Chrome did not encode `"` in the hash part of URL allowing an attacker to inject code.
3.  **Insecure Iframe injection:** When the `ogVideoType` is set to "video/vimeo", the `ogVideoUrl` is not properly encoded before injecting into an iframe leading to XSS.
4.  **Insecure link generation:** When the `ogVideoType` is unknown, the `ogVideoUrl` is injected into a link without encoding leading to XSS.
5.  **Insecure Silverlight parameter handling:** When the `ogVideoType` is "silverlight", a parameter containing the `ogVideoUrl` is passed to the silverlight plugin. The plugin improperly parses this parameter which leads to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary Flash code within the security context of a vulnerable WordPress site, bypassing the Same-Origin Policy. This allows the attacker to:
*  Perform actions on behalf of the victim by leveraging the victim's cookies.
*  Steal private information, including CSRF tokens.
*  Perform CSRF attacks.
*  Potentially achieve account takeover.
The vulnerability also affects any other website on the same subdomain as a vulnerable WordPress installation because of the Same-Origin Policy bypass.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Malicious link:** The attacker creates a link to a malicious page that exploits the vulnerability within the `flashmediaelement.swf` file or other vulnerable endpoints.
2. **Open Graph Protocol:** An attacker can post a URL on a social media platform (e.g., Facebook) or any site that uses Open Graph. When a victim views the post and plays the embedded video the XSS is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  The attacker needs to have a malicious Flash file hosted on the third-party domain (`www.[XYZ].com`). The attacker does not need to be able to modify the contents of `flashmediaelement.swf`.
2.  The attacker needs to convince a victim to click on a malicious link or view a crafted post on a vulnerable site (WordPress, Facebook, or any other site using the vulnerable MediaElement.js Flash component).
3.  The victim needs to have Flash enabled and active.
