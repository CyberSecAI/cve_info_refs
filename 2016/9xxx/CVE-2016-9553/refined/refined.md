Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a command injection vulnerability present in the `MgrReport.php` file of the Sophos Web Appliance. This vulnerability is triggered through the `blockip` and `unblockip` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `blockip` and `unblockip` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server process.
*   **System Compromise:** Successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows for full system compromise, including but not limited to data exfiltration, denial of service, and further propagation within a network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/index.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are `blockip` and `unblockip`, which are appended to the URL, followed by malicious shell commands embedded within backticks.
*  **Authentication Required:** The exploit requires a valid username and password for the web administration interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Sophos Web Appliance's web administration interface (typically port 443).
*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs valid administrative credentials to log in to the web interface before exploiting the command injection.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP GET requests to target the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Sophos Web Appliance versions 4.2.1.3 and prior.
*   **Exploit Methods:** Two exploit methods are detailed in the Metasploit module, one using the `blockip` parameter and the other using `unblockip`.
*   **Metasploit Module:** A Metasploit module is provided that automates the exploitation of this vulnerability, including login, command injection, and payload delivery.
*   **Sophos Fix:** The Sophos Community blog post mentions that version 4.3.1 fixes this vulnerability.
*  **Dynamic DNS:** Sophos 4.3.1 also includes changes to DNS usage and recommends not to configure a public DNS server as secondary or tertiary if internal DNS servers do not host the same DNS records.
