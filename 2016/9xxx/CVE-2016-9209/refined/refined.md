Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper processing of out-of-order TCP segments (retransmissions outside the current window that have already been acknowledged). These segments are not correctly handled before being passed to HTTP inspection.
- Specifically, when dealing with GZIP compressed streams, this incorrect handling causes GZIP decompression to fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper TCP segment handling leading to incorrect data processing.
- Failure to properly decompress GZIP compressed streams due to out-of-order TCP segments.
- Incorrect SHA-256 hash calculation for files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware Bypass:** Attackers can bypass malware protection mechanisms by delivering malicious files that are not correctly scanned due to the incorrect SHA-256 hash calculation.
- **File Download:** Allows an attacker to deliver malicious files via HTTP download that would normally be blocked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing authentication.
- **HTTP Download:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into downloading a specially crafted file containing malware via HTTP.
- **Specially Prepared Server:** The attacker needs a server that can send the malicious file and manipulate the TCP segments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a server that can deliver malicious files via HTTP.
- Ability to manipulate TCP segments to trigger the out-of-order segment handling issue.
- Ability to trick a user into downloading the malicious file (e.g., social engineering).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Cisco FirePOWER products, including ASA devices with FirePOWER services and AMP appliances.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this issue.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is provided as Base 4.3, Temporal 4.1
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the TCP processing and is related to the fact that out of order TCP segments are not correctly handled which leads to incorrect processing of compressed data.
