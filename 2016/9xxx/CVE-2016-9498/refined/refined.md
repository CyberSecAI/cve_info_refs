Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Unserialization of unsafe Java objects. This means the application was deserializing untrusted data without proper validation, which can lead to the instantiation of malicious objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper checks during the deserialization process of Java objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is running.
- **Full System Compromise:** Since the RMI registry of the application runs with administrator privileges, successful exploitation leads to complete control of the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without the need for authentication.
- **Network Accessible:** The vulnerability is exposed through the application's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application's RMI registry.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in ManageEngine Applications Manager versions 12 and 13 (up to build 13100).
- It was fixed in version 13 (build 13200).
- The vulnerability was reported on 02 November 2016 and fixed on 08 February 2017.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 rating of 10.0 (Critical).
