Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the possibility of accessing Admin Control Panel (ACP) backups using short file names on Windows servers. This likely implies a weakness in how the software handles file paths and names on Windows, specifically regarding short file name (8.3 format) aliasing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The application fails to properly restrict access to backup files based on short file names on Windows, which are alternate names automatically generated for long file names.
- **Predictable Path:** The existence and location of backup files are either too predictable or can be discovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the ACP backups. This could include database credentials, configuration settings, or user data, leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Request Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted web requests to access the backup files using their short name equivalents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the affected MyBB installation.
- **Knowledge of Short File Names:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the short file name equivalent of the ACP backup files on the Windows server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Windows installations of MyBB.
- The issue was addressed in MyBB version 1.8.8. The fix includes the addition of access rules to the `htaccess.txt` and `htaccess-nginx.txt` files to restrict access to the backup directory.
