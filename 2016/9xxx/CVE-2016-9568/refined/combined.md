# Carbon Black - Security Advisories: CVE-2016-9570, CVE-2016-9568 and CVE-2016-9569

Kyriakos Economou

Senior R&D team member at LRQA

13 Apr 2017

LRQA have discovered three vulnerabilities in Carbon Black; CVE-2016-9570, CVE-2016-9568 and CVE-2016-9569. Two of these have been patched at the time of writing.

## CVE-2016-9570

* Module: cb.exe (SRC-149)
* Version: 5.1.1.60603
* Bug Type: Read-Out-Of-Bounds
* Impact: DoS
* Prerequisites: Hijack NetMon Pipe
* Severity: Medium
* Status: Remediated

Note: The following technical details are taken from the x86 build of the Carbon Black Sensor module. Variable sizes might change in x64 build.

### **Overview**

The Carbon Black sensor receives data through the “*\\.\pipe\netmon”*named pipe and selects the appropriate handler based on a number that goes from 0 to 9.
If we send number ‘4’ as a command type then the DWORD store at offset (Buffer\_Base + 0x7B) it will be interpreted as size for memory allocation. If we indicate 0x41414141 as size, the final size requested will be (size + 0x50). The driver has already checked if supplied size value is zero or a negative number, thus 0x80000000 and greater, so there are no integer overflows in this case.

```
014FC09B  PUSH    ECX      ;HeapSize = 0x41414150
014FC09C  PUSH    0           ;Flags = 0
014FC09E  PUSH    EAX      ;hHeap
014FC09F  CALL    DWORD PTR DS:[<&KERNEL32.HeapAlloc>]
```

If the allocation succeeds, the driver will copy (size – 1) bytes to that buffer without validating the size of the buffer that keeps the input data, which will cause the Carbon Black Sensor to crash through an invalid pointer dereference. A memory access violation on read in this case.

### **Recommendation**

Perform additional validation checks over the input that is processed through the named pipe.

## **CVE-2016-9568**

* Module: cbstream.sys (SRC-148)
* Version: 5.1.1.60603
* Bug Type: Design Security Issue
* Impact: Perform unauthorized actions
* Prerequisites: Hijack NetMon Pipe
* Severity: Medium
* Status: Unfixed

### Overview

This issue has not yet been fixed by Carbon Black, so LRQA have opted to release only the limited details above for now.

## **CVE-2016-9569**

* Module:cbstream.sys (SRC-147)
* Version: 5.1.1.60603
* IOCTL: 0x62430028
* Bug Type: Read-Out-Of-Bounds
* Impact: DoS
* Prerequisites: Admin Privileges
* Severity: Low
* Status: Remediated

Note: The following technical details are taken from the x86 build of the driver module. Variable sizes might change in x64 build.

### **Overview**

When supplying the aforementioned IOCTL code, the driver will interpret the second DWORD (4 bytes) as a counter and the third DWORD as a value to search for in an allocated buffer.
The issue is that if the supplied counter is too big, then while parsing a memory allocation trying to find a match for the supplied value (3rd DWORD) it will eventually reach an address that doesn’t belong to an allocated memory page (read-out-of-bounds) resulting into an invalid pointer dereference which will lead to system crash, aka BSoD.

### **Disassembly**

![Disassembly](/globalassets/cyber-labs/carbon-black-security-advisories-cve-2016-9570-cve-2016-9568-and-cve-2016-9569/1-disassembly.png)
### **WinDBG – Crash Sample**

**ECX:** counter limit provided through user input via IOCTL
eax=88128000 ebx=00000001 ecx=41414141 edx=00000008 esi=0064c33c edi=8078f6fc
eip=a06dc366 esp=8078f4e0 ebp=8078f4e4 iopl=0         nv up ei ng nz na po cy
cs=0008  ss=0010  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=0030  gs=0000             efl=00010283
**cbstream+0x3366:**
a06dc366 8b10   mov     edx,dword ptr [eax]  ds:0023:88128000=???????? <- **Invalid pointer dereference**

### **Recommendation**

Validate that ‘counter’ parameter doesn’t exceed a specific value. If that value is not ‘known’ then perform boundary checks against the buffer by validating the address to read from before that happens.
