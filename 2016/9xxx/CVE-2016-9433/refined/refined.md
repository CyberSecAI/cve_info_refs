{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An array index out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the `wc_push_to_iso2022` function when processing ISO-2022 encoded content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code attempts to access an array element using an index that is calculated based on the character set code (`cc.ccs`). When this value does not correspond to a valid entry, an out-of-bounds read occurs.",
       "The issue stems from inadequate validation of character set codes before using them as array indices."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability results in a segmentation fault, causing a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTML content with a specific sequence of character set declarations and escape sequences can trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Specifically, embedding a `<meta charset=gb18030>`, followed by a `<a target=\\x80><meta charset=hz>`, and an escape sequence `\\x1b` will cause the out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted HTML document to the w3m browser to trigger the vulnerability. This can be done by opening a malicious webpage or processing a malicious file using w3m."
