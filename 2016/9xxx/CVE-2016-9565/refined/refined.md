Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `_httpsrequest()` function within the MagpieRSS component, used by the Nagios Core front-end to fetch RSS feeds. This function uses `curl` to make HTTP/HTTPS requests, but the sanitization of the URL parameter passed to curl was insufficient, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary `curl` command options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw, where unsanitized user-controlled input ($URI) is passed to the `curl` command via the `exec()` function, allowing the attacker to append malicious parameters to the curl command.
2.  **Insecure HTTP/HTTPS handling:** The Nagios front-end fetches RSS feeds via HTTP or HTTPS. The use of "-k" flag in the curl command for HTTPS requests makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing self-signed certificates.
3.  **Incomplete Patch:** An earlier attempt to fix a similar issue (CVE-2008-4796) was bypassed due to insufficient sanitization, by adding additional quote characters in the URI variable.
4.  **Unrestricted file writing:** The `curl` command can be manipulated to write the server's response to an arbitrary file on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the Nagios server by injecting parameters in the URI, or write a malicious PHP file in the web document root, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
2.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the ability to write files, attackers can plant backdoors within the Nagios server's web directory to gain remote command execution capability.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Once the attacker has command execution capabilities in the context of `www-data` or `nagios` user, they may escalate their privileges to root by exploiting another vulnerability CVE-2016-9566.
4.  **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise, potentially allowing access to sensitive monitoring data, and providing a gateway to other systems within the network monitored by Nagios.
5.  **Network Compromise:** In the case of a large scale compromise of a DNS server that is used by Nagios servers, attackers can potentially gain access to many affected Nagios servers in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Man-in-the-Middle:** Attackers can intercept the Nagios server's HTTP/HTTPS request to the remote RSS feed server, by DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning or domain hijacking. By doing so the attacker will be able to modify the response and inject malicious curl parameters.
2.  **Compromised DNS:** Attackers that have access to a compromised DNS server can redirect nagios server request to an attacker controlled server, therefore allowing them to exploit the Nagios server.
3.  **CSRF attack:** In Nagios versions greater than 4.0.5 an attacker could entice a user to click a malicious link that triggers the vulnerable scripts which could lead to exploitation.
4.  **Traffic modification:**  Attackers within the network can modify the traffic and inject a redirect to the vulnerable `rss-newsfeed.php` script when the nagios control panel is accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network Proximity:** An attacker must be in a position to intercept the Nagios server's network traffic, by being on the same network or having access to a compromised router/DNS.
2.  **DNS Spoofing/Hijacking:** Ability to spoof DNS responses for `www.nagios.org` or compromise the actual DNS servers to redirect traffic to the malicious server controlled by the attacker.
3.  **Basic Web Exploitation Skills:** Knowledge of HTTP, and the ability to use tools like `curl` and netcat to create payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Nagios Core versions prior to 4.2.2.
*   The vulnerable code is present in `rss-corefeed.php`, `rss-corebanner.php`, and `rss-newsfeed.php`.
*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure use of `exec()` function to execute a `curl` command, where parameters are directly injected.
*   Nagios Core versions <= 4.0.5 automatically load the vulnerable scripts, making them easier to exploit.

In summary, CVE-2016-9565 is a serious vulnerability that allows for remote code execution, and it can have a high impact on the targeted systems as well as the network that is being monitored by the vulnerable Nagios installation.
