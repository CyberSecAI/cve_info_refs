  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-9921",
    "description": "Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is vulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while copying VGA data when cirrus graphics mode was set to be VGA. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process instance on the host, resulting in DoS.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Divide by zero error in cirrus_do_copy function within the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA emulator.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation leading to a division by zero"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user within the guest can cause a denial of service by crashing the QEMU process on the host.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation through a crafted sequence of VGA operations within the guest OS leading to an invalid state in the cirrus_do_copy function"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Privileged access within the guest OS"
     ]
