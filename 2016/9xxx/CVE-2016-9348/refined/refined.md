- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Plaintext storage of passwords within a configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passwords for the device are stored in plaintext within a configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the configuration file can obtain the plaintext passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device and its configuration files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would require local access and privilege to read the configuration file to exploit this vulnerability.
