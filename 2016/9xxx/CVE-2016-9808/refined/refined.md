{
  "CVE-2016-9808": {
    "Description": "Multiple flaws were discovered in GStreamer's FLC/FLI/FLX media file format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause an application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-9634, CVE-2016-9635, CVE-2016-9636, CVE-2016-9808)",
    "Root cause": "The format permits multiple skip and count pairs per canvas line, and the skip counts are considered individually rather than cumulatively. It is possible to get the skip + count check to pass while still writing off the end of the line due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9635.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing skip and count pairs in FLC/FLI/FLX media files."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause an application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Processing specially crafted FLC/FLI/FLX media file via a GStreamer application"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to entice or force a user or automated system using GStreamer to process a specially crafted file."
    ]
