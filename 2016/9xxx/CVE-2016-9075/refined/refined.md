Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9075:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- WebExtensions were able to access the `mozAddonManager` API.
- The `mozAddonManager` API provides privileged access for installing and managing add-ons.
- WebExtensions were able to execute scripts on pages that expose the `mozAddonManager` API (e.g., `addons.mozilla.org`, `testpilot.firefox.com`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:**  WebExtensions, which are intended to be sandboxed, could gain elevated privileges through the `mozAddonManager` API.
- **Bypassed Security Checks:**  By accessing the privileged API, extensions could bypass intended security checks.
- **Inadequate Content Script Restriction:** The browser failed to properly restrict content scripts on pages with privileged APIs like `mozAddonManager`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Add-on Installation:**  A malicious WebExtension could install other extensions without explicit user permission.
- **Malicious Add-on Injection:** Attackers could potentially inject malicious add-ons into the user's browser via a compromised WebExtension, gaining control over the browser or user data.
- **Full Browser Control:** A malicious extension could achieve full control over the browser if the API is abused.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious WebExtension:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious WebExtension that the user installs.
- **Compromised WebExtension:** A legitimate extension could be compromised and updated by an attacker to gain access to the vulnerable API.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** While not the primary vector, a MITM attack that defeats certificate pinning could be used to replace a legitimate extension with a malicious one. (This was related to CVE-2016-9064).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to create a malicious WebExtension:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious or compromise a legitimate WebExtension.
- **Victim Interaction:** The victim has to install the malicious WebExtension.
- **Knowledge of privileged URLs/APIs:** The attacker needs to be aware of the privileged pages which expose the `mozAddonManager` API.

**Mitigation:**

- The fix was to prevent WebExtensions from executing scripts on sites with elevated privileges, specifically those exposing the `mozAddonManager` API.
- This was done by filtering out these privileged pages when creating the host permissions list for WebExtensions.
- A follow-up bug was filed to address potential issues with `webRequest` API, to prevent modification of CSP headers.
