- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the web UI, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of credentials within a trusted session, as well as the alteration of the intended functionality of the web UI.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the web UI of the IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server. An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to interact with the web UI in order to inject the malicious code. The attacker would need the "PR:L" (low privileges).
