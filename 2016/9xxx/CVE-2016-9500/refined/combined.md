Accellion FTP Multiple Security Vulnerabilities

SYSTEMS AFFECTED:

 All versions

Reference: http://www.accellion.com/

VULNERABILITY DETAILS:

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration via API

Accellion allows username enumeration for accounts present on the FTP server. In case a invalid account
is passed to the server, the server returns the username in response , where as there is no response in case a
valid username exists

RISK FACTOR: Medium

CVSS: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N

CVE-2016-9499

URL: https://<server_url>/courier/isInvalidRecipient.api

Reproduction Steps:

1.  Perform the provide POST request with IP/URL of the server. In case of usernames , provide a list

of arbitrary user names

2.  If an username exist a 0 value is returned in response, which also states that 0 usernames were

found to be invalid, where as in case of invalid usernames , the number of invalid usernames and
the list of usernames is returned

Please find below the snapshots for the POC stated above.

Valid username response

Invalid username response

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will allow an un-authorized user to enumerate
username for account present on the FTP server or the LDAP in case if LDAP credentials
are linked with the server.

Vulnerability #2:  Cross-site Scripting

Accellion makes use of a flash component by Accusoft's Prizm Content. The flash component provides
various programing parameters which can be set to add an cross-site scripting payload. Using the
functionality it’s possible for an external attacker to send victims a link, containing the xss payload.

RISK FACTOR: Medium
