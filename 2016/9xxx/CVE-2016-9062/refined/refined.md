Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9062:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Private browsing mode in Firefox for Android was not properly preventing the storage of browsing history metadata, such as URLs and icon URLs. This information was being persisted in the `browser.db` and `browser.db-wal` files within the Firefox profile, even after private browsing mode was exited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privacy violation:** The primary weakness is the failure to maintain privacy in private browsing mode. Metadata about visited websites, which should be ephemeral, is written to persistent storage.
- **Data leakage:** A malicious actor with root access to the device could potentially access these files and obtain information about the user's private browsing activity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  A local attacker with root access to an Android device could extract browsing history from the `browser.db` and `browser.db-wal` files, even after the user had exited private browsing mode.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access required:** The attacker needs root access to the user's Android device to access the Firefox profile directory and the relevant files.
- **Physical device access:** The attacker would likely need physical access to the device or a way to gain root privileges remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Root Access:** The attacker must have root privileges on the Android device to access the Firefox data directory.
- **Local user:** The attacker is assumed to be a local user with root privileges on the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report indicates that the metadata was being stored in the `metadata` table of the `browser.db` database.
- The fix involves overriding the method responsible for storing metadata to a no-op for private tabs, preventing any metadata from being saved when private browsing is used.
- The vulnerability is specific to Firefox for Android and does not affect other versions.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" in severity by Mozilla.
- The bug was fixed in Firefox 50 (Aurora) and Firefox 51.
