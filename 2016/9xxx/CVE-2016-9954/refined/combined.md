Fix exponential explosion in backtrack compilation

```
The trick is to define * in terms of +, instead of vice versa, because
if you do it the other way around you must compile the remaining regex
twice, and if that remainder uses +, it will compile its remainder
twice, and so forth, resulting in 2^n compilations.
```
