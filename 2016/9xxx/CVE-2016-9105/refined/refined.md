Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9105:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2016-9105. The description from multiple sources clearly indicates a memory leak vulnerability in the `v9fs_link` function within QEMU's 9pfs implementation, which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `v9fs_link` function not properly releasing the reference to the `oldfidp` fid object. Specifically, after using the `oldfidp` object, it is not "put" (unreferenced) which means the reference counter will never reach 0.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a memory leak due to a missing `put_fid` call for `oldfidp`. This leads to a resource exhaustion vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A privileged user inside a QEMU guest can repeatedly trigger the `v9fs_link` function, resulting in the host system leaking memory. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the host system runs out of memory, impacting other services.  The SUSE information also mentions "QEMU process crash" as a potential result.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Plan 9 File System (9pfs) interface in QEMU. Specifically, the `v9fs_link` function is the vulnerable point.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the QEMU guest OS.
    *   The guest OS must be configured to share directories with the host through the 9pfs mechanism.
    *   The attacker must have a way to call or trigger the `v9fs_link` function to exploit the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Details:**
   * The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description in that it specifies that `oldfidp` was not released.
   * The Suse page provides additional information regarding affected products and versions, as well as references to specific SUSE bugzilla entries and security advisories.
   * The openwall.com posting provides the original patch link.
   * The Gentoo advisory lists this CVE as one of several fixed in `app-emulation/qemu` version >= 2.7.0-r6.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-9105 describes a memory leak in QEMU's `v9fs_link` function. A privileged user within a guest OS can exploit this vulnerability by calling the function repeatedly, causing memory leakage on the host machine, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition. The root cause is a missing call to unreference an object, which prevents its memory from being released.
