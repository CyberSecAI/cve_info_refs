- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper memory allocation when opening malformed files using the FBX-SDK library functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Buffer Overflow: access to unallocated memory, potential code execution
    - Return of Unexpected or Uninitialized Pointers: read from or write to unexpected memory locations, resulting in arbitrary functions to be invoked or denial of service state
    - Infinite Loop: uncontrolled consumption of resources or denial of service state
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Code execution
    - Denial of service
- **Attack vectors**: Opening malformed FBX, DXF, DAE or 3DS format files using the FBX-SDK library functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malformed file that will be processed by an application using the vulnerable FBX-SDK.
