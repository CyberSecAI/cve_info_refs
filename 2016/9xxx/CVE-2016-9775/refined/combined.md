## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Additional patches are included in this Critical Patch Update for the following non-exploitable CVEs in this Oracle product family:

* Oracle E-Business Suite Information Discovery
  + Installer (Apache Log4j): CVE-2020-9488.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

Package: tomcat8
Version: 8.0.14-1+deb8u4
Severity: critical
Tags: security

Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is set
writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then the tomcat8
user, in the situation envisaged in DSA-3670 and DSA-3720, see also
  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Oct/4>
could use something like commands
  touch /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  chmod 2747 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
to create a file:
  # ls -l /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  -rwxr-Srwx 1 tomcat8 tomcat8 0 Nov 23 09:00 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
Then if the tomcat8 package is removed (purged?), the postrm script runs
  chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/
and that will leave the file world-writable, setgid root:
  # ls -l /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  -rwxr-Srwx 1 root root 0 Nov 23 09:00 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
allowing "group root" access to the world.

Hi Paul,

Thank you very much for reporting this issue. I confirm this happens
when purging the package only. The offending chown was first introduced
in the tomcat6 package 6 years ago [1] as part of the fix for #567548.
The same issue is also found in the tomcat7 package.

Do you think running something like "chmod -R 640 /etc/tomcat8" right
before the chown is an appropriate solution to this issue?

Dear Emmanuel,

Might protect against "static" things, but vulnerable to a race.

Your postrm script might want to kill all tomcat8 processes, also.
That might be a "good thing": deluser or delgroup might not "work"
with left-over, running processes; and might protect against a race.

But really... why do you care about leaving some "dangling" useless
object, owned by some long-gone UID or GID?

I don't understand why this is a security issue when
/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack is owned by root:root after the purge and
the tomcat8 user doesn't even exist anymore.

Nevermind. I missed the "world". However dpkg warns about that
/etc/tomcat8/Catalina is not empty on purge, so the admin will be
informed that something requires his attention. Besides all tomcat
processes are killed on purge.

I think the solution is quite simple.

Let's replace

chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/ || true

with

rm -rf /etc/tomcat8

I mean purge means purge. Remove all files, don't leave anything behind.

As another improvement suggestion for Tomcat 9, we could stop deleting
the tomcat user on purge and let the admin decide. I believe this is
even consensus within the project and will protect against reusing files
with the old GID and UID for something unintended.

My understanding is that the file is left with execution permissions for
all users and setgid root after the purge. Any local user can then take
control of the system.

That's tempting but I wonder if we aren't missing something.

Other packages are installing things under /etc/tomcat8, for example
solr-tomcat and jspwiki, but fortunately in these cases the packages are
installing symlinks to other configuration files, and by the time
tomcat8 is purged these links have already been removed.

Is there another case where removing the files in /etc/tomcat8 is
undesirable? What about files created by the sysadmin in this directory
(like the ones we avoided to chmod on upgrades in #825786) ?

I thought the users created by a package were supposed to be removed
when the package is purged, but this isn't a requirement in the policy.
I've found #621833 that deals with this topic and the consensus is
indeed not to remove the user.

If we follow the consensus I would also suggest reusing the same user
when switching to a new version to Tomcat. The last time I switched from
tomcat7 to tomcat8 it was annoying to chmod manually the log files of my
web applications. If there was a unique tomcat user for the
tomcat{7,8,9} package that would be easier.

This would be similar to the jetty8 and jetty9 packages sharing the same
'jetty' user (but in this case the user is also removed when the package
is uninstalled, this is problematic when the old package is removed
after the new one is installed).

I don't know the motivations behind this complexity. I can imagine a
case where an administrator switches from tomcat8 to tomcat9 and doesn't
expect the old package to remove files unknown to him so they can be
moved to the configuration directory of the new package.

The upgrade scenario could look like this:

1. Install tomcat8
2. Declare a web application in /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost
3. Uninstall tomcat8
4. Install tomcat9
5. Move /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/* to /etc/tomcat9/Catalina/localhost

If the step 3 also removes the webapp configuration the administrator is
going to be angry (but arguably less than having his system hacked).

What about switching the files left to nobody:nogroup instead of
root:root? That would be less disruptive for the stable and oldstable
updates than removing /etc/tomcat8 completely.

I guess just removing /etc/tomcat8/Catalina would be an option too. As
far as I know nothing else requires it to be present after the removal
of Tomcat. If there were applications with such a dependency we should
take a look at them.

Hmm... You suggested some chmod before chown. Your attacker sits tight,
waits for the chmod, then creates the "bad thing" in readiness for your
chown. The chmod takes time to complete, the chown takes time to get up
and start: plenty of time in between for the attacker to act.

You misunderstood. Do not remove things in "step 3": leave alone, do not
chown. (Remove the chown from your script.) Leave it being owned by the
tomcat8 UID, not bother that the UID will be "gone" and un-named.

That would be less dangerous, but still wrong; would still be privilege
escalation, though to a less useful entity.

Yes you could "forcibly" remove /etc/tomcat8/Catalina. But then, just
remove all of /etc/tomcat8 so there is definitely nothing left to chown.

---

I now notice a typo in your postrm script. It has lines like:

        if [ -d /var/lib/tomcat8/common ] && [ -z "`(find var/lib/tomcat8/common/classes -type f)`" ] ; then

and are missing a "/" in front of "var". (Of course the "if" are
superfluous, just do the "rmdir".)

---

I now notice that the Debian bug contraption does not CC me on messages:
just being the submitter does not add you to the CC list, you need to
explicitly "subscribe". So I missed a number of intermediate messages.

Markus wrote previously:

Where does that happen? I do not think that is true.

Neither are any possible setuid-tomcat8 or setgid-tomcat8 files removed.

Changes:
 tomcat8 (8.0.14-1+deb8u5) jessie-security; urgency=high
 .
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-9774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9774): Potential privilege escalation when the tomcat8
     package is upgraded. Thanks to Paul Szabo for the report (Closes: #[845393](bugreport.cgi?bug=845393))
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-9775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9775): Potential privilege escalation when the tomcat8
     package is purged. Thanks to Paul Szabo for the report (Closes: #[845385](bugreport.cgi?bug=845385))
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-6816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6816): The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted
     invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy
     that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different
     interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the
     HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack
     and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own.
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-8735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8735): The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener was not updated to take
     account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat installations
     using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution
     vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than critical
     due to the small number of installations using this listener and that it
     would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible to an attacker
     even when the listener is used.
   * Backported the fix for upstream bug 57377: Remove the restriction that
     prevented the use of SSL when specifying a bind address for the JMX/RMI
     server. Enable SSL to be configured for the registry as well as the server.
   * [CVE-2016-5018](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5018) follow-up: Applied a missing modification fixing
     a ClassNotFoundException when the security manager is enabled (see #846298)
   * [CVE-2016-6797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6797) follow-up: Fixed a regression preventing some applications
     from accessing the global resources (see #845425)
   * [CVE-2015-5345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5345) follow-up: Applied a missing modification to DefaultServlet
   * Backported a fix for a test failure in Test*NonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator
     with recent JREs
   * Backported a fix disabling the broken SSLv3 tests
   * Refreshed the expired SSL certificates used by the tests
   * Set the locale when running the tests to prevent locale sensitive tests
     from failing
   * Added asm-all.jar to the test classpath to fix TestWebappServiceLoader
   * Fixed a test failure in the new TestNamingContext test added with the fix
     for [CVE-2016-6797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6797)
   * Test failures are no longer ignored and now stop the build

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Debian Bug     : 802312 845385 845393

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine, as well as in its Debian-specific maintainer
scripts. Those flaws allowed for privilege escalation, information
disclosure, and remote code execution.

As part of this update, several regressions stemming from incomplete
fixes for previous vulnerabilities were also fixed.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.56-3+deb8u6.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 7.0.72-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.

Package: tomcat8
Version: 8.0.14-1+deb8u4
Severity: critical
Tags: security

Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is set
writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then the tomcat8
user, in the situation envisaged in DSA-3670 and DSA-3720, see also
  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Oct/4>
could use something like commands
  touch /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  chmod 2747 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
to create a file:
  # ls -l /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  -rwxr-Srwx 1 tomcat8 tomcat8 0 Nov 23 09:00 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
Then if the tomcat8 package is removed (purged?), the postrm script runs
  chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/
and that will leave the file world-writable, setgid root:
  # ls -l /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
  -rwxr-Srwx 1 root root 0 Nov 23 09:00 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack
allowing "group root" access to the world.

Hi Paul,

Thank you very much for reporting this issue. I confirm this happens
when purging the package only. The offending chown was first introduced
in the tomcat6 package 6 years ago [1] as part of the fix for #567548.
The same issue is also found in the tomcat7 package.

Do you think running something like "chmod -R 640 /etc/tomcat8" right
before the chown is an appropriate solution to this issue?

Dear Emmanuel,

Might protect against "static" things, but vulnerable to a race.

Your postrm script might want to kill all tomcat8 processes, also.
That might be a "good thing": deluser or delgroup might not "work"
with left-over, running processes; and might protect against a race.

But really... why do you care about leaving some "dangling" useless
object, owned by some long-gone UID or GID?

I don't understand why this is a security issue when
/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack is owned by root:root after the purge and
the tomcat8 user doesn't even exist anymore.

Nevermind. I missed the "world". However dpkg warns about that
/etc/tomcat8/Catalina is not empty on purge, so the admin will be
informed that something requires his attention. Besides all tomcat
processes are killed on purge.

I think the solution is quite simple.

Let's replace

chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/ || true

with

rm -rf /etc/tomcat8

I mean purge means purge. Remove all files, don't leave anything behind.

As another improvement suggestion for Tomcat 9, we could stop deleting
the tomcat user on purge and let the admin decide. I believe this is
even consensus within the project and will protect against reusing files
with the old GID and UID for something unintended.

My understanding is that the file is left with execution permissions for
all users and setgid root after the purge. Any local user can then take
control of the system.

That's tempting but I wonder if we aren't missing something.

Other packages are installing things under /etc/tomcat8, for example
solr-tomcat and jspwiki, but fortunately in these cases the packages are
installing symlinks to other configuration files, and by the time
tomcat8 is purged these links have already been removed.

Is there another case where removing the files in /etc/tomcat8 is
undesirable? What about files created by the sysadmin in this directory
(like the ones we avoided to chmod on upgrades in #825786) ?

I thought the users created by a package were supposed to be removed
when the package is purged, but this isn't a requirement in the policy.
I've found #621833 that deals with this topic and the consensus is
indeed not to remove the user.

If we follow the consensus I would also suggest reusing the same user
when switching to a new version to Tomcat. The last time I switched from
tomcat7 to tomcat8 it was annoying to chmod manually the log files of my
web applications. If there was a unique tomcat user for the
tomcat{7,8,9} package that would be easier.

This would be similar to the jetty8 and jetty9 packages sharing the same
'jetty' user (but in this case the user is also removed when the package
is uninstalled, this is problematic when the old package is removed
after the new one is installed).

I don't know the motivations behind this complexity. I can imagine a
case where an administrator switches from tomcat8 to tomcat9 and doesn't
expect the old package to remove files unknown to him so they can be
moved to the configuration directory of the new package.

The upgrade scenario could look like this:

1. Install tomcat8
2. Declare a web application in /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost
3. Uninstall tomcat8
4. Install tomcat9
5. Move /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost/* to /etc/tomcat9/Catalina/localhost

If the step 3 also removes the webapp configuration the administrator is
going to be angry (but arguably less than having his system hacked).

What about switching the files left to nobody:nogroup instead of
root:root? That would be less disruptive for the stable and oldstable
updates than removing /etc/tomcat8 completely.

I guess just removing /etc/tomcat8/Catalina would be an option too. As
far as I know nothing else requires it to be present after the removal
of Tomcat. If there were applications with such a dependency we should
take a look at them.

Hmm... You suggested some chmod before chown. Your attacker sits tight,
waits for the chmod, then creates the "bad thing" in readiness for your
chown. The chmod takes time to complete, the chown takes time to get up
and start: plenty of time in between for the attacker to act.

You misunderstood. Do not remove things in "step 3": leave alone, do not
chown. (Remove the chown from your script.) Leave it being owned by the
tomcat8 UID, not bother that the UID will be "gone" and un-named.

That would be less dangerous, but still wrong; would still be privilege
escalation, though to a less useful entity.

Yes you could "forcibly" remove /etc/tomcat8/Catalina. But then, just
remove all of /etc/tomcat8 so there is definitely nothing left to chown.

---

I now notice a typo in your postrm script. It has lines like:

        if [ -d /var/lib/tomcat8/common ] && [ -z "`(find var/lib/tomcat8/common/classes -type f)`" ] ; then

and are missing a "/" in front of "var". (Of course the "if" are
superfluous, just do the "rmdir".)

---

I now notice that the Debian bug contraption does not CC me on messages:
just being the submitter does not add you to the CC list, you need to
explicitly "subscribe". So I missed a number of intermediate messages.

Markus wrote previously:

Where does that happen? I do not think that is true.

Neither are any possible setuid-tomcat8 or setgid-tomcat8 files removed.

Changes:
 tomcat8 (8.0.14-1+deb8u5) jessie-security; urgency=high
 .
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-9774](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9774): Potential privilege escalation when the tomcat8
     package is upgraded. Thanks to Paul Szabo for the report (Closes: #[845393](bugreport.cgi?bug=845393))
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-9775](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9775): Potential privilege escalation when the tomcat8
     package is purged. Thanks to Paul Szabo for the report (Closes: #[845385](bugreport.cgi?bug=845385))
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-6816](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6816): The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted
     invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy
     that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different
     interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the
     HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack
     and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own.
   * Fixed [CVE-2016-8735](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8735): The JmxRemoteLifecycleListener was not updated to take
     account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat installations
     using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution
     vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than critical
     due to the small number of installations using this listener and that it
     would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible to an attacker
     even when the listener is used.
   * Backported the fix for upstream bug 57377: Remove the restriction that
     prevented the use of SSL when specifying a bind address for the JMX/RMI
     server. Enable SSL to be configured for the registry as well as the server.
   * [CVE-2016-5018](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5018) follow-up: Applied a missing modification fixing
     a ClassNotFoundException when the security manager is enabled (see #846298)
   * [CVE-2016-6797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6797) follow-up: Fixed a regression preventing some applications
     from accessing the global resources (see #845425)
   * [CVE-2015-5345](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5345) follow-up: Applied a missing modification to DefaultServlet
   * Backported a fix for a test failure in Test*NonLoginAndBasicAuthenticator
     with recent JREs
   * Backported a fix disabling the broken SSLv3 tests
   * Refreshed the expired SSL certificates used by the tests
   * Set the locale when running the tests to prevent locale sensitive tests
     from failing
   * Added asm-all.jar to the test classpath to fix TestWebappServiceLoader
   * Fixed a test failure in the new TestNamingContext test added with the fix
     for [CVE-2016-6797](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6797)
   * Test failures are no longer ignored and now stop the build

Subject: CVE request: tomcat privilege escalations in Debian packaging

Hello,

the Debian security team would like to request 2 CVEs for issues in
Tomcat packaging. Both were discovered by Paul Szabo.

  * Privilege escalation when upgrading tomcat8 package
    <https://bugs.debian.org/845393>

    > Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is
    > set writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then
    > the tomcat8 user, in the situation envisaged in DSA-3670 and
    > DSA-3720, see also <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Oct/4>
    > could use something like commands
    >
    >   mv -i /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost /tmp
    >   ln -s /etc/shadow /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost
    >
    > to create a symlink.
    >
    > Then when the tomcat8 package is upgraded (e.g. for the next DSA),
    > the postinst script runs
    >
    >   chmod 775 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost
    >
    > and that will make the /etc/shadow file world-readable (and
    > group-writable). Other useful attacks might be to make the
    > objects:
    >
    >   /root/.Xauthority
    >   /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
    >
    > world-readable; or make something (already owned by group tomcat8)
    > group-writable (some "policy" setting maybe?).

  * Privilege escalation when removing tomcat8 package
    <https://bugs.debian.org/845385>

    > Having installed tomcat8, the directory /etc/tomcat8/Catalina is
    > set writable by group tomcat8, as per the postinst script. Then

    > DSA-3720, see also <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Oct/4>
    > could use something like commands
    >
    >  # touch /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack

Debian Bug     : 802312 845385 845393

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine, as well as in its Debian-specific maintainer
scripts. Those flaws allowed for privilege escalation, information
disclosure, and remote code execution.

As part of this update, several regressions stemming from incomplete
fixes for previous vulnerabilities were also fixed.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.14-1+deb8u5.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 8.5.8-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [tomcat6](/security/cves?package=tomcat6) - Servlet and JSP engine
* [tomcat7](/security/cves?package=tomcat7) - Servlet and JSP engine

## Details

USN-3177-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Tomcat. The update introduced a

regression in environments where Tomcat is started with a security manager.

This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the Tomcat realm implementations incorrectly handled

passwords when a username didn't exist. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to enumerate usernames. This issue only applied to Ubuntu

12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-0762](/security/CVE-2016-0762))

Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh discovered that Tomcat incorrectly

limited use of a certain utility method. A malicious application could

possibly use this to bypass Security Manager restrictions. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2016-5018](/security/CVE-2016-5018))

It was discovered that Tomcat did not protect applications from untrusted

data in the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to redirect outbound traffic to an arbitrary proxy

server. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-5388](/security/CVE-2016-5388))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled reading system

properties. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass

Security Manager restrictions. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6794](/security/CVE-2016-6794))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly controlled certain configuration

parameters. A malicious application could possibly use this to bypass

Security Manager restrictions. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6796](/security/CVE-2016-6796))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly limited access to global JNDI

resources. A malicious application could use this to access any global JNDI

resource without an explicit ResourceLink. This issue only applied to

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6797](/security/CVE-2016-6797))

Regis Leroy discovered that Tomcat incorrectly filtered certain invalid

characters from the HTTP request line. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to inject data into HTTP responses. ([CVE-2016-6816](/security/CVE-2016-6816))

Pierre Ernst discovered that the Tomcat JmxRemoteLifecycleListener did not

implement a recommended fix. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-8735](/security/CVE-2016-8735))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled error handling in the

send file code. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access

information from other requests. ([CVE-2016-8745](/security/CVE-2016-8745))

Paul Szabo discovered that the Tomcat package incorrectly handled upgrades

and removals. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain

root privileges. ([CVE-2016-9774](/security/CVE-2016-9774), [CVE-2016-9775](/security/CVE-2016-9775))
