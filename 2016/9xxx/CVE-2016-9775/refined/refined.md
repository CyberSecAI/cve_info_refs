Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-9775 from the provided content:

**CVE-2016-9775**
*   **Description:** The postrm script in Tomcat packages might allow local users with access to the tomcat account to gain root privileges via a setgid program in the Catalina directory, as demonstrated by /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/attack.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation. A local attacker with access to the Tomcat account can potentially gain root privileges.

**Debian (bugs.debian.org content)**
*   **Vulnerability:** Privilege escalation via removal of tomcat8 package
*   **Root Cause:** The `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` directory is set writable by the `tomcat8` group, as per the `postinst` script. A user in the `tomcat8` group can create a file with `chmod 2747`, resulting in a world-writable, setgid root file after the `postrm` script runs `chown -Rhf root:root /etc/tomcat8/`.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  `tomcat8` user creates a file within `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` with `chmod 2747`.
    2.  The tomcat8 package is removed (purged).
    3.  The `postrm` script changes ownership to root, but the file remains world-writable and setgid root.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires local access and membership in the `tomcat8` group prior to package removal.
*   **Fixed in Versions:**
    *   `tomcat8/8.5.8-2`
    *   `tomcat8/8.0.14-1+deb8u5`
*   **Proposed Solutions:**
    *   Remove the `chown` command from the script, leaving files owned by the tomcat8 UID.
    *   Change ownership to `nobody:nogroup` instead of `root:root`.
    *   Remove `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` or the entire `/etc/tomcat8` directory during purge.
    *   Prevent the tomcat8 user from being deleted on purge.

**Ubuntu (ubuntu.com content)**
*   Identifies CVE-2016-9775 as a vulnerability where the Tomcat package incorrectly handled removals, allowing a local attacker to obtain root privileges.
*   Lists affected Ubuntu versions and corresponding package versions that address the vulnerability.

**NetApp (security.netapp.com content)**

*   Affected Products: Element Plug-in for vCenter Server, OnCommand Balance, OnCommand Shift, Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere 6.x
*   Lists fixed releases for affected products.
