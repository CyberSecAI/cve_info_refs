Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit message "fix security vulnerability to get user list, reported by pang0lin":

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit message indicates a vulnerability related to retrieving user lists. The diff shows the addition of `'getUsersByJSON' => 'Get Users',` to the `actions` array within the `usersController.php` file.  This suggests that the vulnerability was likely related to unauthorized or unintended access to user data via a `getUsersByJSON` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure Access Control:** The vulnerability appears to stem from a lack of proper access control on the `getUsersByJSON` function. The commit fixes this by adding the action to the defined allowed actions, meaning that previously it was accessible without the proper checks in place.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially retrieve a list of all users, potentially exposing sensitive information, depending on what fields the `getUsersByJSON` function returned.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Direct Request:** An attacker could directly send a request to the `getUsersByJSON` function, bypassing intended access controls

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the application server.
- **Knowledge of the endpoint:** The attacker would need to know or discover the existence of the `getUsersByJSON` function.

**Additional notes:**

- The commit message states the vulnerability was reported by "pang0lin".
- The diff shows a single line change that adds the `getUsersByJSON` action to the allowed actions array of the `usersController`.
- This is more detail than the CVE provides.
