Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9879:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause lies in the inconsistent handling of URL path parameters by different Servlet containers, and the way Spring Security processes these parameters. The Servlet specification doesn't clearly define how path parameters should be handled, leading to discrepancies.
- Some servlet containers, like Apache Tomcat, strip path parameters before returning values from `getContextPath()`, `getServletPath()`, and `getPathInfo()`. However, other containers might include these parameters in the returned values.
- Spring Security uses the values returned by `getPathInfo()` to map requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters in this value can cause a constraint bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Handling of Path Parameters:** Spring Security doesn't correctly account for URL path parameters when processing security constraints.
- **Bypass of Security Constraints:** By inserting a URL path parameter containing an encoded "/", an attacker can circumvent defined security rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass security constraints and gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attacker injects a URL path parameter with an encoded "/" into a request. For example: `/resource;param=%2F`.
- This parameter manipulation bypasses security checks due to the inconsistency in how path parameters are handled by different Servlet containers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are needed. The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoints and their access restrictions.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the local network, so the attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects systems using servlet containers that include path parameters in the return value of `getPathInfo()`.
- Apache Tomcat is not vulnerable because it strips path parameters, adhering to the Servlet Expert group's guidance.
- IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.x is known to be affected.
- The vulnerability is addressed by Spring Security versions 3.2.10, 4.1.4 and 4.2.1, which reject requests containing an encoded "/" in path parameters.
- This fix can be disabled by setting the `DefaultHttpFirewall.allowUrlEncodedSlash` to `true`, but this reintroduces the vulnerability if the application runs on a servlet container that returns path parameters.
