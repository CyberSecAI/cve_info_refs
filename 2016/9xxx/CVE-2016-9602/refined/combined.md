Subject: CVE-2016-9602 Qemu: 9p: virtfs allows guest to access host
 filesystem

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper link following issue.
It could occur while accessing symbolic link files on a shared host directory.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system
beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a
host.

Reference:
----------
   -> <http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup>
   -> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413929>

Please see a proposed patch to fix this issue attached herein.

This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.

'CVE-2016-9602' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201704-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could the worst of which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.0-r9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.0-r9** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote server can cause a crash in the client causing execution of
arbitrary code, and a Denial of Service within the QEMU process. Remote
or Local users within a guest QEMU environment can cause a Denial of
Service condition of the QEMU guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.8.0-r9"

```

```
This series tries to fix CVE-2016-9602. This vulnerability affects all
accesses to the underlying filesystem in the "local" backend code.

If QEMU is started with:

-fsdev local,security_model=<passthrough|none>,path=/foo/bar

then the guest can cause QEMU to create symlinks in /foo/bar.

This causes accesses to any path /foo/bar/some/path to be unsafe, since
untrusted code within the guest (or in another guest sharing the same
virtfs folder) could change some/path to point to a random path of the
host filesystem.

The core problem is that the "local" backend relies on path-based syscalls
to access the underlying filesystem. All path-based syscalls are vulnerable
to this issue, even open(O_NOFOLLOW) or syscalls that explicitly don't
dereference symlinks, since the kernel only checks the rightmost element of
the path. Depending on the privilege level of the QEMU process, a guest can
end up opening, renaming, changing ACLs, unlinking... files on the host
filesystem.

A possible fix is to always walk paths manually with openat(O_NOFOLLOW), and
use "*at()" variants of all syscalls in the "local" backend code. This will
likely not improve performances for path-based syscalls in the guest, but I
don't see how to fix the issue without kernel support (like an O_PATHSTATIC
flag to tell the full path should not traverse any symlink for example).

A fair amount of code is shared by all security models: this series hence
starts with preparatory patches to split the code. This allows to have
patches of reasonable size, that don't affect too many code paths.

TODO:
- the accesses to metadata files of the "mapped-file" security mode also need
  to be converted

This series tries to fix CVE-2016-9602 reported by Jann Horn of Google
Project Zero:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413929>

This vulnerability affects all accesses to the underlying filesystem in
the "local" backend code.

If QEMU is started with:

-fsdev local,security_model=<passthrough|none>,path=/foo/bar

then the guest can cause QEMU to create symlinks in /foo/bar.

This causes accesses to any path /foo/bar/some/path to be unsafe, since
untrusted code within the guest (or in another guest sharing the same
virtfs folder) could change some/path to point to a random path of the
host filesystem.

The core problem is that the "local" backend relies on path-based syscalls
to access the underlying filesystem. All path-based syscalls are vulnerable
to this issue, even open(O_NOFOLLOW) or syscalls that explicitly don't
dereference symlinks, since the kernel only checks the rightmost element of
the path. Depending on the privilege level of the QEMU process, a guest can
end up opening, renaming, changing ACLs, unlinking... files on the host
filesystem.

The right way to address this is to use "at" variants of all syscalls in
the "local" backend code. This requires to open directories without
traversing any symlink in the intermediate path elements. There was a
tentative to introduce an O_BENEATH flag for openat() that would address
this:

<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7007181/>

Unfortunately this never got merged. I shall contact the author and try
to revive this kernel patchset.

In the meantime, an alternative is to walk through all path elements
manually with openat(O_NOFOLLOW). This is likely to degrade performances,
but I don't see any better way to get the vulnerability fixed in 2.9.
I'll try to come up with some numbers later.

Stefan and Daniel, I've Cc'ed you because we talked about the issue
on irc already. Feel free to comment/review if you have some spare
cycles, it will be appreciated (but of course, I'll understand if
you don't :)
