Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9964:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `redirect()` function in the `bottle` framework did not properly filter carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CRLF Injection:** The lack of filtering allowed attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers by inserting `\r\n` sequences within the redirect URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **HTTP Header Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious HTTP headers, such as `Set-Cookie`, to manipulate client-side behavior, potentially leading to session hijacking, XSS attacks, or other malicious actions.
- The example given is setting a malicious cookie via `redirect("233\r\nSet-Cookie: name=salt")`

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can control the redirect URL parameter. By crafting a malicious URL containing `\r\n` followed by arbitrary HTTP headers, the attacker can inject these headers into the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the redirect URL used by the `bottle` application, either via user-controlled parameters or some other form of input.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit `6d7e13d` shows the fix implemented by sanitizing headers and adding a check to raise a `ValueError` if control characters `\n`, `\r`, or `\0` are found in header names or values.
- Debian Security Advisory DSA-3743-1 confirms this vulnerability and provides the fix versions in Debian packages.
