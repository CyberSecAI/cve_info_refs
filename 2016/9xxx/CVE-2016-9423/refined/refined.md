Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from a buffer overflow in w3m. Specifically, it is triggered by malformed HTML tags, particularly with the `<button type=>` tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary issue is a buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated memory, leading to memory corruption. The `onAnchor` function is identified as the location of the overflow.
*   **Malformed HTML Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered by incorrect handling of malformed HTML, specifically the button tag without a value for its type attribute. This leads to an incorrect "a" pointer, which is then dereferenced, causing the crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The Gentoo Security Advisory indicates that successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process.
*   **Denial of Service:** The provided crash log shows a segmentation fault, demonstrating that the vulnerability can at least lead to a denial-of-service. The crash is caused by attempting to dereference the corrupted pointer.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML File:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML file containing the specific malformed tags.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable w3m instance with the malicious HTML content. This could happen over the web, via a file, or by any means where w3m processes the input.
* **No special privileges:**  The attacker does not need special permissions on the targeted system to trigger the vulnerability, as it is triggered by malformed input.

**Additional Details**

*   The GitHub issue #9 provides a concrete example of how to trigger the bug with a simple HTML snippet, which leads to a crash.
*   The fix for this issue is part of commit `9f0bdcfdf061db3520bd1f112bdc5e83acdec4be`
