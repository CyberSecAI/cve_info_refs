Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9124:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The login page of Revive Adserver was susceptible to password-guessing attacks due to the lack of proper restrictions on authentication attempts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307):** The system did not implement sufficient measures to prevent or mitigate brute-force attacks against user accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by repeatedly attempting to log in with different passwords.
- While complete system compromise isn't stated, the confidentiality of user accounts is compromised as well as integrity for the compromised account
- This vulnerability had a CVSSv2 score of 8.5, indicating a high severity.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Brute-force attack:** Attackers would attempt to guess passwords by repeatedly submitting login requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **No authentication required:**  Attackers do not need to have prior access or a valid account to perform this attack.
- **Network access:** Attackers need to be able to send login requests to the Revive Adserver application over the network.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix implemented includes a random delay introduced after a failed login attempt along with a mechanism that increases the delay if multiple attempts for the same user are detected to discourage brute force attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text mentions that an account lockdown feature was considered but rejected to avoid disrupting regular users during attacks.
- The commit associated with this fix introduces a base delay between 1-5 seconds on password failures with the possibility of a 4x increase if concurrent login attempts are detected for the same username.
- The fix is present in `lib/OA/Auth.php` and `lib/OX/Extension/authentication/authentication.php`
