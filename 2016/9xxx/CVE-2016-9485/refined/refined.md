    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File with Insecure Permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges on the affected machine by overwriting executable files with malicious code that is then executed by the SecureConnector agent with elevated privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": "A local unprivileged user can exploit this by taking ownership of and modifying files downloaded by the SecureConnector agent before they are executed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user with the ability to write to the temporary directory where the agent downloads files."
