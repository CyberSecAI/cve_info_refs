Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9628:

**CVE-2016-9628**
*   **Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference occurs within the `HTMLlineproc2body` function. This is due to an invalid `form_id` used to index into the `forms` array. Although the `form_id` is validated to be within the range of `0` and `form_max`, `form_max` itself is not properly validated, and can be influenced by user input leading to an out-of-bounds access and a null pointer dereference.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The `form_max` variable is derived from user-controlled data, allowing for the creation of a large `form_id` that results in out of bounds access of the `forms` array.
    *   **Null Pointer Dereference:** If the `form_id` exceeds valid indices of `forms`, the access will result in a null pointer, causing the program to crash.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the program crashes due to a segmentation fault when the null pointer is dereferenced.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTML input, specifically using `<button>` tag with a value attribute and a following `<input_alt>` tag and a `<form_int>` tag that specifies a large form id.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to provide a malicious HTML document to the w3m browser, either by loading a local file or making the browser access a remote, attacker-controlled server hosting such malicious content.
