Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2016-9123.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the CBC-HMAC implementation when calculating buffer sizes on 32-bit architectures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow in `resize` and `computeAuthTag` functions of the `cbc_hmac.go` file. When calculating buffer sizes, the code used `int` type, leading to potential overflows, particularly on 32-bit systems. This could cause an authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass for CBC-HMAC encrypted ciphertexts, especially on 32-bit architectures due to the integer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing inputs that result in an integer overflow when calculating buffer sizes used in the CBC-HMAC algorithm.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input data that leads to the integer overflow during size calculations.
- The attacker needs to interact with the affected system that is using the vulnerable `go-jose` library, and specifically the CBC-HMAC implementation.
