{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-9900",
  "rootCause": "External resources that should be blocked when loaded by SVG images can bypass security restrictions through the use of `data:` URLs.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Cross-domain data leakage"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker could potentially leak cross-origin data by loading external resources through SVG data URLs. This could expose sensitive information across different domains.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered when an SVG image, loaded via an `<img>` tag, loads a second SVG file through the `fill` attribute (or potentially other SVG attributes), using `data:` URLs. The second SVG file then loads arbitrary external resources, bypassing security restrictions."
  ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious SVG image into a context where it will be processed. This might involve getting a user to load a malicious page, or injecting the SVG via a separate vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely."
