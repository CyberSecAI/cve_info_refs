Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of the `get_sessions` servlet within CA Unified Infrastructure Management. This servlet incorrectly allows access to session information without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication required to access the `get_sessions` servlet.
- **Information Disclosure:** The servlet returns session IDs for all active sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can use the disclosed session IDs to hijack active sessions, potentially including administrative sessions.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to administrative sessions could lead to further unauthorized actions on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `get_sessions` servlet, meaning they need network access to the affected CA Unified Infrastructure Management instance.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor (CA) on 2016-04-28
- A patch was released by CA to address this issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection via filter ID '24588'.
