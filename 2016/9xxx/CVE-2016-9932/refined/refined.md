Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9932:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect emulation of the x86 instruction `CMPXCHG8B` in the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, the emulator failed to properly ignore legacy operand size overrides, leading to the use of a general operand size value instead of the expected 8 or 16 bits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Operand Size Handling:** The emulator incorrectly handles operand size prefixes, failing to adhere to the instruction's specification of ignoring legacy overrides.
- **Information Leak:** This incorrect handling leads to a leak of hypervisor stack data to the guest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious, unprivileged guest can potentially extract sensitive information from the host system.
- The amount of leaked information depends on the guest's architecture.
   - 96 bits are leaked to guests running in 64-bit mode.
   - 32 bits are leaked to other guests.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Guest:** The attack vector is a malicious, unprivileged guest operating within the vulnerable Xen environment.
- **Operand Size Override:** The guest exploits the vulnerability by using a supposedly ignored operand size prefix with the `CMPXCHG8B` instruction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unprivileged Guest Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a Xen guest virtual machine.
- **Ability to Trigger CMPXCHG8B:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `CMPXCHG8B` instruction with a specific operand size prefix within the guest.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Affected Systems:** Xen versions 3.3 through 4.7 are affected. Xen master and 4.8 and earlier versions of Xen 3.2 are not affected.
- **Platform Specific:** Only x86 systems are affected; ARM systems are not vulnerable.
- **Exposure:**
    - On Xen 4.6 and earlier, all HVM guest user processes are vulnerable, including unprivileged processes.
    - On Xen 4.7, the vulnerability is exposed to HVM guests with certain privileges (like direct hardware access) or to all user processes in a VM configured with a non-default CPU vendor string.
- **Mitigation:** No mitigation is available other than applying the patch.
