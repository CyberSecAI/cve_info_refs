Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-9859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper handling of crafted request parameter values within the saved searches and import features of phpMyAdmin. Additionally, when phpMyAdmin is configured with `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true;`, it allows an unauthenticated user to trigger a denial of service attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafted request parameter values can trigger a DoS in the saved searches and import functionalities.
- Improper input handling when using `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true` can lead to an unauthenticated DoS condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can result in a denial of service, rendering phpMyAdmin unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** Can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the phpMyAdmin instance when `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true`.
- **Remote attacker:** Can exploit the saved searches and import features with crafted requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
- For the vulnerability related to `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true`  no prior authentication is required. For saved searches and import features authentication may or may not be required depending on configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a group of DoS vulnerabilities fixed in phpMyAdmin.
- Patches were released to fix this issue on the 4.0, 4.4, and 4.6 branches.
- The issue is assigned CWE-661 and CWE-400, indicating improper resource handling and uncontrolled resource consumption.
