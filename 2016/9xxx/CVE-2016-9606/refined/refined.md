```
{
  "Root cause": "RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insecure deserialization"
  ],
  "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a crafted request that leverages the YamlProvider."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable service that can be processed by RESTEasy. No authentication is mentioned in the description.",
   "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered under 'certain conditions' which implies a specific format or structure is needed."
