Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-9303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper memory allocation when opening malformed FBX files through the FBX-SDK library functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: Access to unallocated memory, potentially leading to code execution.
- Return of Unexpected or Uninitialized Pointers: Reading from or writing to unexpected memory locations, potentially resulting in arbitrary function invocation or a denial-of-service state.
- Infinite Loop: Uncontrolled consumption of resources, leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system by exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Denial of Service: Vulnerabilities may lead to application crashes due to memory issues or infinite loops
- Arbitrary Memory Access: Attackers can read/write to unexpected memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening malformed FBX, DXF, DAE, or 3DS files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted (malformed) FBX, DXF, DAE, or 3DS file.
- The user of the vulnerable application must open the malicious file.
