  "CVE-2016-9962": {
    "description": "The runc component used by `docker exec` feature of docker allowed additional container processes to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain low-level access to these new processes during initialization. An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception.",
    "root_cause": "The `runc` component, specifically within the `docker exec` functionality, insecurely opened file descriptors which could be accessed by container's pid 1 via `ptrace`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of file descriptors",
      "Lack of proper namespace isolation when a process is attached through `docker exec`",
      "Insufficient restriction on `ptrace` capabilities within containers"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious process within a container with root privileges can gain access to file descriptors of processes attached later (like with `docker exec`), potentially leading to:\n  - Accessing host content\n  - Container escape\n  - Memory access\n  - Syscall interception",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attacking processes that join a container via `docker exec`",
      "Abuse of the `ptrace` system call"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Root privileges within the container",
      "Ability to modify runC state before process initialization",
       "Ability to attach to another process inside the container"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The issue was present because a safety mechanism was missing from docker exec, allowing a race condition. Processes launched with docker exec could be ptraced within the container and they briefly kept their file descriptors linked to content outside the container. This was addressed in docker 1.12.6 by preventing ptracing of these processes (through the DUMPABLE process attribute) and having incoming processes flush their file descriptors before being moved. The vulnerability can only be exploited on containers with elevated privileges, and is mitigated by SELinux, seccomp profiles or custom seccomp profiles"
