With this fix, SELinux should have these rules and therefore allow the transition.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c5)  Luwen Su    2017-01-12 14:15:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Daniel Walsh from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c4)) > Simplest thing is to use setools-console >  > # yum install setools-console > # sesearch -A -s spc_t -t svirt_sandbox_file_t -p entrypoint >  > The error they were seeing was that there was not rules returned. > With this fix, SELinux should have these rules and therefore allow the > transition.  Thanks Dan! And i'd like to keep this open for a while for more testing.   In docker-1.12.5-14.el7.x86_64 # sesearch -A -s spc_t -t svirt_sandbox_file_t -p entrypoint Found 2 semantic av rules:    allow filesystem_unconfined_type filesystem_type : chr_file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock relabelfrom relabelto append unlink link rename execute swapon quotaon mounton execute_no_trans entrypoint execmod open audit_access } ;     allow spc_t svirt_sandbox_file_t : file entrypoint ;    The version the reporter uses  1.10.3-46.el7.14 # sesearch -A -s spc_t -t svirt_sandbox_file_t -p entrypoint ERROR: could not find datum for type spc_t   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c6)  Daniel Walsh    2017-01-12 14:28:13 UTC  ``` Just to make sure everyting is working.  # sesearch -A -s spc_t -p entrypoint  To show that their are other entrypoints for spc_t, just not the container image type. svirt_sandbox_file_t.  BTW In the future (RHEL7.4), this type will be changing to container_file_t.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c7)  Devan Goodwin    2017-01-12 19:48:50 UTC  ``` I think it's still failing:  (root@n3 ~) $ rpm -qa | grep selinux selinux-policy-targeted-3.13.1-102.el7_3.4.noarch container-selinux-1.12.5-14.el7.x86_64 libselinux-2.5-6.el7.x86_64 libselinux-utils-2.5-6.el7.x86_64 selinux-policy-3.13.1-102.el7_3.4.noarch libselinux-python-2.5-6.el7.x86_64  $ tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep denied type=AVC msg=audit(1484249804.933:1300): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=5817 comm="etcd" name="etcd" dev="dm-0" ino=1048971 scontext=system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c247,c296 tcontext=system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0 tclass=dir  I'm told there is some confusion over the reproducer, it's really just installing kubeadm, and running "kubeadm init". (<https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/>) Skipping the setenforce 0 obviously which we're trying to get out of these instructions, though that is not going so well.   Reproduce instructions:   cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo [kubernetes] name=Kubernetes baseurl=<http://yum.kubernetes.io/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64> enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 repo_gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=<https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg>        <https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg> EOF  yum install -y docker kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker systemctl enable kubelet && systemctl start kubelet  Then just run kubeadm init.  The bug will cause it to hang at "waiting for control plane" and you will see the above denial in audit.log.  If it completes with setenforce 1, then the bug is fixed.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c8)  Devan Goodwin    2017-01-12 19:50:50 UTC  ``` To re-try, just do "kubeadm reset" followed by your next "kubeadm init".   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c9)  Daniel Walsh    2017-01-12 21:30:53 UTC  ``` This looks like a different issue.  You are not running a Privileged container or you ar enot labeling etcd correctly.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c10)  Daniel Walsh    2017-01-12 21:33:02 UTC  ``` Your container is running as svirt_lxc_net_t, which is a confined type.  It should be running privileged which would be spc_t, if this is a privileged container.  The original bug was about not being able to run spc_t containers.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c11)  Devan Goodwin    2017-01-13 13:21:03 UTC  ``` I'm running the same version of kubeadm as the reporter and it should therefore specify the etcd pod should run as spc_t. However I'm trying to test at Lokesh' request and all I had available was RHEL 7.2 vagrant vms, I suspect trying to just install those rpms is not working, is it possible the spc_t would be ignored on RHEL 7.2 and default to svirt_lxc_net_t?  I will try with a full yum update but indeed the error I'm hitting isn't the same so I'm not sure I'm set up to test this properly.  If anyone involved can verify the reproducer in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c7) no longer occurs then we are good.. In meantime I will try to update my vm and see if it gets better.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c12)  Devan Goodwin    2017-01-13 13:58:42 UTC  ``` I upgraded everything to RHEL 7.3, my etcd pod is still getting denied with the error in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c7). Is there any possibility something is busted with trying to run containers using spc_t causing them to run as svirt_lxc_net_t? kubeadm version is the same, the etcd pod definition in there is configured to run as spc_t, as it was on CentOS where this was reported.  Can anyone get through the steps in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c7) successfully with selinux enforcing?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c13)  Daniel Walsh    2017-01-13 14:04:50 UTC  ``` We should fix etcd requiring spc_t, but I have a feeling this is an issue with kubeadm not sending down the proper flags to docker to run the container. If you run the container in permissive mode and then inspect the container, is it running with the privileged flag?  BTW The problem being reported is that the /var/lib/etcd? directory mounted into the container has the wrong SELinux context on it.  From a docker point of view adding the :Z to the volume mount would fix this issue.  You could go in behind the scenes and fix this by executing  chcon -t svirt_sandbox_file_t -R /var/lib/etcd   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c14)  Devan Goodwin    2017-01-13 15:50:03 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1413100](show_bug.cgi?id=1413100 "CLOSED ERRATA - Issues with Docker, Kubernetes, and SELinux") spun out for my separate later issue.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1412385#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:46:01 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0116.html>   ``` |  |

AWS install:  1 master, 1 etcd, 1 registry/router, 2 application nodes 2.  S3 configured as back-end registry storage 3.  Initial build of cakephp, django, dancer, rails, eap64, nodejs and tomcat8 quickstart apps successful.   All layers pushed to registry. 4.  Start running concurrent builds of 4 random applications at a time.  Actual results:  Many builds fail with "unexpected EOF" during the image push   Expected results:  Successful builds.  I last ran this test on 3.4.0.36 before the holidays and did not see this.  Additional info: build at loglevel 6 attached   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1410434#c1)  Mike Fiedler    2017-01-05 13:54:18 UTC  ``` Docker:  docker.x86_64

## Synopsis

Moderate: runc security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0127)

## Topic

An update for runc is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The runC tool is a lightweight, portable implementation of the Open Container Format (OCF) that provides container runtime.

Security Fix(es):

* The runc component used by `docker exec` feature of docker allowed additional container processes via to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain low-level access to these new processes during initialization. An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception. (CVE-2016-9962)

Red Hat would like to thank the Docker project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Aleksa Sarai (SUSE) and Tonis Tiigi (Docker) as the original reporters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

unit file. This is happening in Fedora because we use a different containerd process while docker upstream embeds containerd spawning. I'll update the unit file and release an update. Meanwhile, could you add "--start-timeout=2m" to the docker-containerd.service ExecStart and re-test?

If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-dbc2b618eb>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1412148#c7)  Fedora Update System    2017-01-13 02:23:54 UTC  ``` docker-1.12.6-3.git51ef5a8.fc25 has been pushed to the Fedora 25 stable repository.

# runC: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201701-34**

A vulnerability in runC could lead to privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/runc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.0\_rc2-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.0\_rc2-r2** |

### Background

RunC is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the
OCI specification.

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in runC that allows additional container
processes via ‘runc exec’ to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the
container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running
as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes.

### Impact

An attacker, who is able to successfully escape the container or modify
runC’s state before process initialization, could escalate privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All runC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/runc-1.0.0_rc2-r2"

```

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-gp4j-w3vj-7299/dependabot)

## Package

gomod

github.com/opencontainers/runc
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 1.0.0-rc2

## Patched versions

1.0.0-rc3

## Description

RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2017-01-18 08:17:37 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c0)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:23:40 UTC  ``` The following issue was reported in Docker:  RunC allowed additional container processes via `runc exec` to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c1)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:23:52 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Docker project Upstream: Aleksa Sarai (SUSE), Tõnis Tiigi (Docker)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c2)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:32:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1236624](attachment.cgi?id=1236624 "CVE-2016-9962 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1236624&action=edit "CVE-2016-9962 patch") [CVE-2016-9962](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9962) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c8)  Trevor Jay    2017-01-03 18:35:43 UTC  ``` This is an extremely difficult to exploit flaw on standard RHEL and Fedora systems.   I checked the 1.10.3 and 1.12.5 builds on Brew. Both drop the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability by default. 1.10.3 blacklists `ptrace` calls under the default seccomp profile. Thus, this flaw only comes into play for containers that already have elevated privileges.   Even if `ptrace` is available. The proposed exploit scenario of quickly attaching to a process joining the container space and using its file descriptors is *not* possible under the default SELinux configuration. The containerized PID 1 will have a type of `container_t` or similar SELinux type and thus will be blocked by standard type enforcement from accessing accessing any resources that haven't already been made available to containerized processes.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c12)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 08:58:12 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/54>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c13)  Trevor Jay    2017-01-11 15:27:11 UTC  ``` Created runc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1412238](show_bug.cgi?id=1412238 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9962 runc: docker: insecure opening of file-descriptor allows privilege escalation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c15)  Vincent Danen    2017-01-11 21:34:32 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/cve-2016-9962>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:45:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0116 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0116.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:47:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0123 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0123.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:48:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0127 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0127.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2020-06-17 21:54:22 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/50a19c6ff828c58e5dab13830bd3dacde268afe5>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c20)  Jason Shepherd    2020-06-22 01:21:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  On Red Hat systems with SELinux enabled, the dangers of even privileged containers are mitigated.

Name : docker-latest
Product : Fedora 24
Version : 1.12.6
Release : 1.git51ef5a8.fc24
URL : <https://github.com/projectatomic/docker>
Summary : Automates deployment of containerized applications
Description :
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will
run virtually anywhere.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on
and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer builds
and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production\*, on VMs, bare-metal
servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.

## Topic

An update for docker is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: docker (1.12.5). (BZ#1404298)

Security Fix(es):

* The runc component used by `docker exec` feature of docker allowed additional container processes via to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain low-level access to these new processes during initialization. An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception. (CVE-2016-9962)

Red Hat would like to thank the Docker project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Aleksa Sarai (SUSE) and Tonis Tiigi (Docker) as the original reporters.

Bug Fix(es):

* The docker containers and images did not read proxy variables from the environment when contacting registries. As a consequence, a user could not pull image when the system was configured to use a proxy. The containers and images have been fixed to read proxy variables from the environment, and pulling images now from a system with a proxy works correctly. (BZ#1393816)
* Occasionally the docker-storage-setup service could start before a thin pool is ready which caused it to failed. As a consequence, the docker daemon also failed. This bug has been fixed and now docker-storage-setup waits for a thin pool to be created for 60 seconds. This default time can be configured. As a result, docker and docker-storage-setup start correctly upon reboot. (BZ#1316786)
* Previously, the docker daemon's unit file was not supplying the userspace proxy path. As a consequence, containers that exposed ports could not be started. To fix this bug, the unit file was updated to include the userspace proxy path option to the daemon start command, along with several other minor packaging fixes. As a result, containers that expose ports can now be started as expected. (BZ#1406460)
* Previously, the system CA (Certificate Authority) pool was excluded when the registry CA is used from the /etc/docker/certs.d/ directory. As a consequence, pulling images failed with the following error:

Failed to push image: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority

This bug has been fixed and docker now reads the system CA pool correctly and pulling images now work correctly. (BZ#1400372)

* Previously, the docker daemon option did not handle correctly the "--block-registry docker.io" option. As a consequence, docker allowed pulling images from docker.io even when the "--block-registry docker.io" option was enabled. This update fixed the handling of the option, and now using "--block-registry docker.io" correctly blocks image pulling. (BZ#1395401)

A container on-entry vulnerability was found in docker and has been assigned  [CVE-2016-9962.](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9962)  The flaw addresses a specific attack that uses `ptrace`  and improperly-flushed file descriptors to gain access to content outside a container. This attack is only a risk when running privileged containers and is mitigated by SELinux.

This issue was publicly disclosed on **January 10, 2017.**

## Background Information

This vulnerability arises when a process that would normally run in one namespace is launched or moved into a different namespace. Namespaces normally act as a security mechanism because processes within different namespaces cannot see or manipulate one another. The problem is that when a process is moved into a namespace, it becomes exposed to malicious actions from processes that are already in that namespace. On-entry vulnerabilities attack processes that join containers via `nsenter`  or `docker exec`  . A successful attack can result in a malicious process gaining system access or other privileges.

For example, if a malicious process has taken over a container and managed to obtain `root`  within that container, the malicious process can kill any other process it can "see". Fortunately, container namespacing keeps the malicious process from being able to detect or kill any host processes or any of the processes in other containers. However, if an administrator attempts to investigate the issue by using `nsenter`  to move a shell into the misbehaving container, the malicious process can see and manipulate that shell as well (and terminate it).

## Vulnerable Linux Facilities

The following legitimate Linux facilities can be misused in on-entry attacks. Use Linux security mechanisms such as `SELinux`  and `seccomp`  to prevent their exploitation.

* **ptrace**
  "Process trace" or `ptrace`  is a powerful debugging facility that is available in Linux. Any process with adequate permissions can `ptrace`  another process through the `ptrace`  kernel call. `ptrace`  grants extremely low-level access to the process, including its memory, resources (such as file descriptors), and the ability to intercept process kernel calls.
* **docker exec**
  `docker exec`  is a service provided by the docker daemon that allows an additional process to be launched within an existing container. This is often used to inspect or make manual changes to the container. For example, to launch a bash shell within a misbehaving container in order to debug its behavior, you could use:
  `docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash`
* **nsenter
  ​** `nsenter`  is a Linux utility used to move or launch processes within specific namespaces. Because containers are built on Linux namespaces, `nsenter`  can be used as a more generic version of `docker exec`  .
* **kernel capabilities**
  In Linux, the special powers traditionally granted to the `root`  account have been split into individual capabilities, and some grant more than one administrative power. For example, `CAP_SYS_TIME`  grants only the ability to set the system clock. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`  , on the other hand, grants the range of powers needed to administer a machine. Each kernel capability can be granted or denied to a process individually.
* **seccomp**
  The `seccomp`  Linux facility allows access to kernel calls on an individual basis.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of [Important](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/) .

## Impacted Products

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Openshift Container Platform
* RHEL Atomic Host

## Impact

The flaw in CVE-2016-9962 occurs because a safety mechanism is missing from `docker exec`  .

Until upstream docker 1.12.6, processes that `docker exec`  launched could be `ptrace`  'd within the container and they briefly kept their file descriptors, which were linked to content outside the container. This could be exploited by a process within a container equipped with `ptrace`  abilities. If a malicious process acted quickly enough, it could `ptrace`  the incoming process and gain access to content outside the container. This has been addressed in docker 1.12.6 by preventing `ptrace`ing of these processes (through the `DUMPABLE`  process attribute) and by having incoming processes flush their file descriptors before being moved.

Even without the backport, most installations are *not* at risk:

* On Red Hat systems with SELinux enabled, the dangers of even privileged containers are mitigated. SELinux prevents container processes from accessing host content even if those container processes manage to gain access to the actual file descriptors.
* In most installations, `nsenter`  and `docker exec`  are purely manual operations. OpenShift uses `nsenter`  to facilitate port-forwarding, but without manual intervention, vanilla docker will never move a process into a container or between containers.

## Diagnose your vulnerability

To check whether your docker version already has the backported fix, download and use  [this script](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2016-9962.sh)  .

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers running the affected versions of docker are recommended to update when patches are available. Details about impacted packages as well as recommended mitigation are noted below.

## Updates for Affected Products

| Product | Package | Advisory/Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 | docker-latest, docker, runc | [RHSA-2017-0116](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0116.html) ,  [RHSA-2017-0123](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0123.html) ,  [RHSA-2017-0127](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0127.html) |
| Red Hat Openshift Container Host | docker-latest, docker | patch applied |
| RHEL Atomic Host | docker-latest, docker, runc | patch applied |

### **Mitigation**

`ptrace`  and other dangerous kernel calls can be banned from your containers. Custom seccomp profiles can be created to forbid this behaviour (supported by vanilla docker, OpenShift, and Kubernetes). This will completely prevent attacks based on CVE-2016-9962.

## 1.12.6 (2017-01-10)

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm

based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When

upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not

automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start

the docker service if;

* the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
* a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.

```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.

```

To resolve this:

* Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the

  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
* Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
* Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.6 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or

that the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.

If you are currently using the `--ipv6` option *without* specifying the

`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the

following message:

```
Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating
                       default "bridge" network: failed to parse pool request
                       for address space "LocalDefault" pool " subpool ":
                       could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv6 address
                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network

```

To resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same

behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the

value of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.

In a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network

with the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network

creation will fail with the following message:

```
Error response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space
                            "LocalDefault" pool "" subpool "": could not find an
                            available, non-overlapping IPv6 address pool among
                            the defaults to assign to the network

```

To resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior

as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the

`--subnet` flag.

The network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver

which supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.

Name : docker-latest
Product : Fedora 25
Version : 1.12.6
Release : 2.git51ef5a8.fc25

Summary : Automates deployment of containerized applications
Description :
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will
run virtually anywhere.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on
and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer builds
and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production\*, on VMs, bare-metal
servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.

# Docker 1.12.6 - Security Advisory

---

*From*: Nathan McCauley <nathan.mccauley () docker com>

*Date*: Tue, 10 Jan 2017 17:58:56 -0800

---

```
Docker Engine version 1.12.6 has been released to address a vulnerability
and is immediately available for all supported platforms. Users are advised
to upgrade existing installations of the Docker Engine and use 1.12.6 for
new installations.

Please send any questions to security () docker com.

==============================================================
[CVE-2016-9962] Insecure opening of file-descriptor allows privilege
escalation

==============================================================

RunC allowed additional container processes via `runc exec` to be ptraced
by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the
container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these
new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes
or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the
container

Credit for this discovery goes to Aleksa Sarai from SUSE and Tõnis Tiigi
from Docker.

Set init processes as non-dumpable

```
This sets the init processes that join and setup the container's
namespaces as non-dumpable before they setns to the container's pid (or
any other ) namespace.

This settings is automatically reset to the default after the Exec in
the container so that it does not change functionality for the
applications that are running inside, just our init processes.

This prevents parent processes, the pid 1 of the container, to ptrace
the init process before it drops caps and other sets LSMs.

This patch also ensures that the stateDirFD being used is still closed
prior to exec, even though it is set as O_CLOEXEC, because of the order
in the kernel.

<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/fs/exec.c#L1290-L1318>

The order during the exec syscall is that the process is set back to
dumpable before O_CLOEXEC are processed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1012568#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2016-11-29 11:17:17 UTC  ``` From: Aleksa Sarai  runC passes a file descriptor from the host's filesystem to the "runc init" bootstrap process when joining a container. This allows a malicious process inside a container to gain access to the host filesystem with its current privilege set. Due to the race window between join-and-execve being quite small, this bug is quite hard to exploit. A similar, though mostly unrelated, exploit was discovered in LXC[1].  [1]: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/23/6> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1012568#c1)  Aleksa Sarai   2016-11-29 11:29:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 704061](attachment.cgi?id=704061&action=diff "patch that fixes the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=704061&action=edit "patch that fixes the issue") patch that fixes the issue  This is the patch I've sent to the rest of the upstream maintainers and has been LGTM'd. It applies on master, but I'll probably have to rebase it so we can apply it to our runC package. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1012568#c2)  Aleksa Sarai   2016-11-29 11:38:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 704067](attachment.cgi?id=704067&action=diff "reproducer patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=704067&action=edit "reproducer patch") reproducer patch  In order to test this fix, you'll need to apply the reproducer patch (which just makes the race window much larger so you can test it in a shell -- the linked LXC reproducer could be modified to try to exploit runC without needing to widen the race window). First, set up a bundle for runC:  % docker pull alpine % docker create --name alpine alpine % mkdir rootfs % docker export alpine | tar xvfC - rootfs/ % runc spec  Now you have a config.json and rootfs that you can use with runC.

The first (0001-*) is the fix sent to the ML, the second (0002-*) is my fix which also ensures that containers with CAP_SYS_PTRACE are also "safe" (the attack won't work there either). ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1012568#c18)  Aleksa Sarai   2017-01-08 22:29:16 UTC  ``` Okay, so I just tested it and the f59ba3cdd76f (0.1.1+gitr2818_f59ba3cdd76f) patches also work for the old 1.11.X package (0.1.1+gitr2816_02f8fa7).

Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will
run virtually anywhere.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on
and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer builds
and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production\*, on VMs, bare-metal
servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0123)

## Topic

An update for docker-latest is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: docker-latest (1.12.5). (BZ#1404309)

Security Fix(es):

* The runc component used by `docker exec` feature of docker allowed additional container processes via to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container. This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain low-level access to these new processes during initialization. An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception. (CVE-2016-9962)

Red Hat would like to thank the Docker project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Aleksa Sarai (SUSE) and Tonis Tiigi (Docker) as the original reporters.
