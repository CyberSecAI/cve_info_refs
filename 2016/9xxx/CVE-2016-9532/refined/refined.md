Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-9532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflows in the `writeBufferToSeparateStrips`, `writeBufferToContigTiles`, and `writeBufferToSeparateTiles` functions within `tiffcrop.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to the integer overflows. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `writeBufferToSeparateStrips` at `tiffcrop.c:1170`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.
- Denial-of-service due to memory corruption.
- Out-of-bounds heap read, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted TIFF image file using the `tiffcrop` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a maliciously crafted TIFF image to a user or system that will process it with the vulnerable `tiffcrop` tool.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tools/tiffcrop.c` file of the libtiff library.
- The provided bug report includes a test case (`2016-11-10-heap-buffer-overflow.tif`) that triggers the vulnerability.
- AddressSanitizer reports a heap-buffer-overflow on address `0x60200000eeb1` with a read size of 223 bytes within `tiffcrop.c`
- Valgrind also reports invalid write errors within the same `tiffcrop.c`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in libtiff version 4.0.7.
- The fix involved addressing multiple `uint32` overflows in the mentioned functions.
- The vulnerability primarily affects the `tiffcrop` tool but could impact applications using the vulnerable library functions.
- The fix was committed by Even Rouault on 2016-11-11.
