### @tbonfort **[tbonfort](/tbonfort)** commented [Nov 29, 2016](#issue-192255059)

Error messages created by the OGR driver may leak too much information. See <http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/219426/mapserver-hide-ogr-exception>

Same issue as [#4928](https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/pull/4928) but for OGR

Sorry, something went wrong.
