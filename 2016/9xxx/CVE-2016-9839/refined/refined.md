Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2016-9839:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   The content describes a pull request aimed at reducing verbosity of OGR driver error messages in MapServer. This relates to a vulnerability where sensitive information might be leaked through error messages, which aligns with the description for CVE-2016-9839.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The root cause is the overly verbose error messages generated by the OGR driver within MapServer. These error messages can expose internal details about the system, data source paths, and other potentially sensitive information.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive information through detailed error messages.
    - Lack of proper error handling or sanitization before exposing them to the client.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain knowledge about the system's internal structure, file paths, and potentially sensitive data by triggering specific OGR errors.
     - This information could be used to further exploit the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - By sending crafted requests that trigger OGR errors. The attacker needs to interact with the MapServer software in a way that causes an OGR driver error to be generated.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the MapServer application.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**
  - This pull request (5356) specifically addresses the issue of OGR error messages leaking information. It points to a discussion on stackexchange regarding the problem.
  - It references a similar issue (#4928), indicating this is not an isolated problem with OGR.
  - The fix was merged into the 7.0.3 release branch, indicating that this was not present in previous versions.
