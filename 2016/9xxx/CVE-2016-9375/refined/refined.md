Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-9375:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the DTN (Delay-Tolerant Networking) dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed DTN packet can cause the dissector to enter an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop vulnerability due to improper handling of malformed DTN packets in the dissector.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An infinite loop can cause Wireshark to hang or crash, rendering it unusable.
- Potential crash of Wireshark application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed DTN packets injected onto the network.
- Malformed packet trace files opened by a user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject network traffic containing malicious DTN packets.
- Ability to craft a malicious packet trace file, then convince a user to open it using Wireshark.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Wireshark versions 2.2.2 and 2.0.8 and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered via fuzzing, as indicated by the "fuzz-2016-11-04-25886.pcap" reference.
