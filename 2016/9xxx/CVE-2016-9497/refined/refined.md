- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Authentication bypass
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device has an alternate telnet interface on port 1953 that does not require authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can access administrative commands, including rebooting the modem.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated access via telnet to port 1953.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device and the ability to connect to port 1953 via telnet.
