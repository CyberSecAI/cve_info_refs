- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The bulletin does not describe the specific attack vector but indicates that the vulnerability is related to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The bulletin does not specify the required capabilities or position of an attacker. However, XSS vulnerabilities typically require the attacker to be able to inject malicious code through a vulnerable input or parameter.
