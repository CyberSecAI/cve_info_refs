Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `map.c` file within the Pillow library. Specifically, when processing image files, the code calculates buffer sizes and offsets. If the image dimensions or offset values are large enough, these calculations can overflow, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow during the calculation of buffer sizes and offsets in the `PyImaging_MapBuffer` function within `map.c`. This occurs when multiplying `ysize` and `stride`, as well as when adding the size to the offset, without proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption.
- Arbitrary code execution (possible): The Gentoo security advisory indicates that the vulnerability *may* allow for the execution of arbitrary code. This is likely due to the possibility of writing outside of the intended buffer boundaries, potentially overwriting sensitive memory regions.
- Denial of service: Overflowing the memory allocation can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Information Disclosure: The gentoo security advisory notes that a local attacker could obtain sensitive information, likely because the overflow can overwrite memory containing that information

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed image file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file.
- The file contains large dimensions or large offset values that causes the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed image file to the vulnerable application using the Pillow library.
- This can be achieved remotely by using the malformed image as part of a web application or through local means.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the native extensions of the Pillow library.
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding checks for integer overflows in the calculations within the `map.c` file. This includes checking `ysize * stride` against `INT_MAX` and checking `offset+size` against `SIZE_MAX`.
- The fix also involves a check for errors during memory allocation and handling `IOError` exceptions.
- The vulnerability was reported privately before a public disclosure.
