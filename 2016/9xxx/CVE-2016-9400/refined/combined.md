| [Description](#c0)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-18 15:09:53 UTC  ``` teeworlds upstream has released version 0.6.4.  <https://www.teeworlds.com/?page=news&id=12086> says  > the security vulnerability is worse, attacker controlled memory-writes and > possibly arbitrary code execution on the client, abusable by any server the > client joins  The upstream fix: <https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/ff254722a2683867fcb3e67569ffd36226c4bc62> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Emir Marincic    2017-04-09 17:55:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 469550](attachment.cgi?id=469550 "Version bump") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=469550&action=edit "Version bump"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=469550&action=diff "Version bump")] Version bump  Fixes the old ebuilds as well but i'd remove them completely given this is a RCE. We've yet to see it in use by anyone though so that's nice.  I could also pull-request this if that's desirable. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-04-09 18:02:32 UTC  ``` Thank you for your contribution.  Yes, please create a pull request if possible.  Once a fixed version/ebuild is in repository and stable we will clean up previous versions.   From your patch: > +PM=$(echo ${PV} | cut -c 1-3)  Please try to match Gentoo style. I.e. if you need to change PV use MY_PV and try to use versionator eclass (<https://devmanual.gentoo.org/eclass-reference/versionator.eclass/>) instead of cut. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Emir Marincic    2017-04-09 20:14:37 UTC  ``` Made the requested changes and a pull request. <https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/4400> ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  James Le Cuirot   gentoo-dev  2017-05-04 21:29:28 UTC  ``` 0.6.4 is now in the tree. amd64 and x86 teams, please stabilise. I've tried it out myself on amd64 and it works fine. If you want to try it, it's a relatively small download for a game. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-05-05 14:11:09 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2017-05-06 17:20:52 UTC  ``` x86 stable.  Maintainer(s), please cleanup. Security, please add it to the existing request, or file a new one. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  James Le Cuirot   gentoo-dev  2017-05-06 19:54:49 UTC  ``` Old removed. Security team, please continue. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2017-05-26 06:27:21 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201705-13 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201705-13> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

[0.6.4 released - another security fix](?page=news&id=12086)
(posted by: heinrich5991) |
2016-11-13

As with the 0.6.3 release, a reported security vulnerability motivated this release: This time, the security vulnerability is worse, attacker controlled memory-writes and possibly arbitrary code execution on the client, abusable by any server the client joins.

The changelog:

Bug fixes

* Fix the above-mentioned security vulnerability in the client ([ff25472](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/ff254722a2683867fcb3e67569ffd36226c4bc62)).

* Fix a read of uninitialized memory that is sent over the network, from the server ([7dd463d](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/7dd463d1178e0c1277b5ae6cf0841a0f68e2408b)).

* Fix decoding of overlong UTF-8 sequences to non-invalid code points, leading to possible duplicate names ([#1373](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1373), [205dbce](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/205dbce17234d86ea0b9b42fc7e46bf29c2b6f01)).

* Drop connected packets that come from a formerly connected server in the client ([#1356](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1356), [2057808](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/20578089f0bee3d9e544c1a0cd5699118c6b32d6)).

* Use a different port for connless messages, increasing the difficulty of successful IP spoofing ([7c43b76](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/7c43b76758d44ab0edeeea2de177f3b08af8a008)).

* Make spoofing of server info packets harder ([8af77b6](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/8af77b64ff2b774d1a9f9d44fd2f174e64d3874b)).

* Fix spoofing for vital chunks, and require most chunks to be vital ([f457b58](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/f457b58d68e72df83128a7bc779d71a5208dfe47)).

Other changes

* Sort by player count by default, instead of server name ([1b2a91f](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/1b2a91f0cff53054cb75182843bfb9de939f8b2a)).

* Add a cooldown on unpause ([#1365](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/1365), [56e366a](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/commit/56e366a639dee74080b22307adb5d3ad9f3510ea)).

Use CVE-2016-9400.

Our guess is that neither github.com/teeworlds nor anonscm.debian.org
intended to commit this with a bitwise OR between "Part < 0" and
"Part >= NumParts" above. On first glance, though, the code seems to have
the same effect regardless of whether "Part < 0 | Part >= NumParts" or
"Part < 0 || Part >= NumParts" is used.
