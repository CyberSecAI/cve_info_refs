The provided content is related to a commit that fixes two vulnerabilities. The commit message indicates "fix 2 vulnerabilities reported by felixk3y". The changes in the commit diff show sanitization being added to user-provided input:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** The `expPaginator.php` file was vulnerable to SQL injection through the `order` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The `order` parameter from user input was directly used in SQL query construction without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could manipulate the `order` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted value to the `order` parameter of the `expPaginator` class.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to control parameters passed to the `expPaginator` class.
*   **Fix:** The commit replaces `expString::escape($params['order'])` with `preg_replace('/[^a-z\\_]/i','',$params['order'])` to sanitize the input by removing non-alphanumeric and underscore characters from the order parameter.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** The `helpController.php` file was vulnerable to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the `version` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `version` parameter from user input was directly used without proper sanitization.
*  **Impact**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the `version` parameter which could lead to user session hijacking or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted value to the `version` parameter of the `helpController` class.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to control parameters passed to the `helpController` class.
*   **Fix:** The commit adds `expString::escape($params['version'])` to sanitize the input.
