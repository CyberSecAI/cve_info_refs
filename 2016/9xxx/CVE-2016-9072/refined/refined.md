Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect initialization of plugin tags in 64-bit Firefox on Windows when a new profile is created. Specifically, the NPAPI sandbox, which provides an extra layer of security for plugins, was not being enabled by default in this scenario. This was a regression introduced by a previous bug fix related to forcing windowless mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the absence of the NPAPI sandbox for 64-bit plugins when using a fresh Firefox profile on Windows. This means that plugins running in these instances would have higher privileges and broader access to the system compared to when the sandbox is active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation would allow a malicious plugin to bypass the intended sandbox restrictions, leading to:
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The plugin could gain elevated privileges within the browser process or potentially even at the system level, depending on the nature of the underlying exploit.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A compromised plugin could be used to run arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Exposure of User Data:** With elevated access, the plugin could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including browsing history, cookies, and saved passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugins:** An attacker could exploit this by delivering a malicious plugin to a user who is using a new profile on 64-bit Windows. This could be via a compromised website or other means of distributing plugins.
*   **Compromised Legitimate Plugin:** An attacker could compromise a legitimate plugin and inject malicious code that would be executed outside the sandbox, provided that a user is using a fresh profile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to be aware of the specific circumstances under which the NPAPI sandbox is disabled.
*   **Plugin Development or Compromise:** The attacker would need to either develop a malicious plugin or compromise a legitimate one to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Distribute Plugin:** The attacker would need a way to distribute the malicious plugin to the target user.

In summary, CVE-2016-9072 involves a security bypass due to incorrect plugin initialization in 64-bit Firefox on Windows for new profiles, allowing potential privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and data access if exploited through malicious plugins. This was considered a high-severity vulnerability.
