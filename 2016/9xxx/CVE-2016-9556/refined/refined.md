{
  "CVE-2016-9556": {
    "Description": "The IsPixelGray function in MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h in ImageMagick 7.0.3-8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap read) via a crafted image file.",
    "Root cause": "A heap-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `IsPixelGray` function within `pixel-accessor.h` of ImageMagick. This is triggered when processing a crafted image file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an out-of-bounds heap read. This leads to a crash of the application.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted image file, potentially via network access if the application processes images from untrusted sources.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a specific image file that triggers the overflow in the `IsPixelGray` function. The attacker needs no authentication but user interaction to open the crafted file."
