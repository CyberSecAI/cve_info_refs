{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanity checks on data within the SIZ marker segment of JPEG-2000 image files, specifically in the `jpc_tsfb_getbands2` function, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted image file can trigger the buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or, in a more severe case, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application using the library.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves supplying a malicious JPEG-2000 image to an application that uses the vulnerable Jasper library.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image to an application that uses the Jasper library."
