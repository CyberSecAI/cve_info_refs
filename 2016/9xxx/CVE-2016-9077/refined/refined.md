Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way canvas filters, specifically `feDisplacementMap`, are applied to cross-origin images. The rendering time of the `feDisplacementMap` filter is variable and depends on the input pixel data. This variability allows an attacker to infer information about the pixel data of cross-origin images through timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The primary vulnerability is a timing side-channel attack. The time it takes for the `feDisplacementMap` filter to render reveals information about the pixel data of a cross-origin image.
- **Cross-Origin Access:** The vulnerability exists because the `feDisplacementMap` filter can be applied to cross-origin images without proper restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract information about the pixel data of cross-origin images they don't have direct access to.
- **Pixel Stealing:** The timing attack can lead to the "stealing" of pixel data from cross-origin images

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker would need to create a malicious web page that uses the canvas API and `feDisplacementMap` filters.
- **Cross-Origin Image Loading:** The web page must load a cross-origin image, which the attacker wishes to gain information about.
- **Timing Analysis:**  The attacker must then use JavaScript to perform precise timing measurements of the filter rendering to extract pixel data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page accessible to the victim.
- **Knowledge of Canvas API:** The attacker needs to understand how to use the canvas API and apply filters, and perform timing attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Chrome as well
- The fix involved restricting the application of `feDisplacementMap` filters based on the origin of the images.
- The issue is considered high severity due to potential information disclosure.
- The fix was included in Firefox 50 and later versions.
