Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way NSS (Network Security Services) handles TLS session resumption using Session Tickets, specifically when the server is configured with an ECDSA key pair but lacks an RSA key pair. NSS attempts to cache the session ticket keys using RSA, but if no RSA key is present, it leads to a failure during subsequent connection attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Handling of Session Tickets:** NSS does not correctly handle the scenario where session tickets are used with an ECDSA certificate but without a corresponding RSA key for wrapping the session ticket key.
- **Missing Fallback Mechanism:** When an RSA key is not available, NSS does not have a mechanism to fallback to a different wrapping mechanism or disable caching the session keys, causing the connection to fail.
- **Misleading Error Messages:** The server-side error message produced ("The one-time function was previously called and failed") is not very informative and could be confusing to diagnose.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service.  When a client attempts to connect to a TLS server using an ECDHE-ECDSA cipher suite and session tickets, the connection will fail if the server does not have a RSA key available for the ticket.  This prevents the server from establishing further connections. The issue initially resulted in a crash in older versions of NSS (NSS 3.21), however, the version associated with this CVE, NSS 3.27 and above, experiences handshake failures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely by initiating a TLS connection to a server configured with an ECDSA certificate and without an RSA key pair, while requesting session resumption via session tickets.
- **Handshake Manipulation:** The attacker doesn't directly manipulate any specific data, but instead, initiates the handshake in a way that exposes the vulnerability in NSS's session ticket handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **TLS Handshake Initiation:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate a TLS handshake with the server, using a cipher suite that involves ECDHE-ECDSA and enabling session ticket extension.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves disabling the caching of session ticket keys when a server is using an EC key pair and no RSA key pair.
- The original bug report on bugzilla.mozilla.org shows the vulnerability present in NSS 3.27 and indicates the fix was included in NSS 3.30.
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates the issue was closed as "WONTFIX", which is likely due to the fix being implemented upstream in NSS and subsequently included in later versions of Red Hat products.

In summary, CVE-2016-9574 describes a remote DoS vulnerability in NSS stemming from a lack of proper session ticket handling for ECDSA-only server configurations, which prevents successful TLS connections.
