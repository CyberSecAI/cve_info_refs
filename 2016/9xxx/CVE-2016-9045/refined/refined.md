- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data. The application deserializes data from the `d` parameter in a GET request after base64 decoding it without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). The application uses the PHP `unserialize()` function on base64 decoded user-controlled data, allowing for the injection of arbitrary PHP objects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can craft a malicious serialized PHP object, base64 encode it, and send it via the `d` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious serialized PHP object in the `d` parameter is sent to the `/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/login/sysLoginVerify.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed in the described attack vector (although the fix mentions restricting to known trusted users).
