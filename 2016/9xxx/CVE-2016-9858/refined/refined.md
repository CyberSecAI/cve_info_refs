Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the saved searches and import features of phpMyAdmin. A crafted request parameter value can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Additionally, an unauthenticated user can trigger a DoS when phpMyAdmin is running with `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true;`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-661:** Improper handling of parameters.
*   **CWE-400:** Uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service.
*   DoS vulnerability in the saved searches feature
*   DoS vulnerability in the import feature
*   DoS vulnerability related to the `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true;` setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the phpMyAdmin application to become unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted request parameters:** The attacker sends a malicious request with specific parameter values to the vulnerable features (saved searches or import).
*   **Unauthenticated access (conditional):** When `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true`, unauthenticated users can trigger the DoS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can be located remotely.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin server.
*   **No authentication needed (conditional):** If `$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']=true` is enabled, no authentication is needed to trigger the third vulnerability, otherwise authentication is not specified.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions prior to 4.6.5, 4.4.15.9, and 4.0.10.18.
*   The issue was reported by Emanuel Bronshtein.
*   Patches have been released for the 4.0, 4.4, and 4.6 branches to fix the vulnerabilities.
