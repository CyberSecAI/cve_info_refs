  "CVE-2016-9311": {
    "Description": "NTP.org ntpd versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94 contain a denial of service vulnerability. If the trap service is explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd.",
    "Root cause": "ntpd performs a null pointer dereference when handling a crafted packet while the trap service is enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-476"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can crash ntpd, leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted network packet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system. The ntpd trap service must also be explicitly enabled."
