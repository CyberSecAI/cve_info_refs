Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in Xen's libelf loader when processing 32-bit ELF symbol tables for unprivileged guests.
*   When loading 32-bit ELF symbol tables, the ELF structs are smaller than their 64-bit counterparts. This leaves padding bytes uninitialized at the end of these structs.
*   Specifically, the `e_ehsize` and `e_shentsize` members indicate smaller sizes than the actual `elf_ehdr` and `elf_shdr` structs, resulting in padding being left uninitialized.
*  The vulnerability exists because these unused bytes were not being cleared properly during symbol table loading, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak.  Uninitialized memory from the host system is potentially exposed to the guest during 32-bit ELF symbol table loading. This information leak is small and not under guest control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A malicious unprivileged guest could potentially obtain sensitive information from the host system due to the uninitialized memory being leaked. This information leak could expose host data.
*   The information leaked is small and not directly controllable by the guest, making exploitation more difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A malicious unprivileged guest can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the guest has Xen load kernel symbol tables in 32-bit ELF format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged Guest:** The attacker must be an unprivileged guest with the ability to have Xen load a 32-bit ELF symbol table.
*   **Vulnerable Xen Version:** The host must be running a vulnerable version of Xen (4.7).
*   **Non-HVM default loader**: For x86 HVM guests, the host toolstack must have been configured to load the guest with a non-default loader rather than hvmloader to be vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to Xen 4.7. Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are not affected.
*   The provided patch introduces a helper function (`elf_set_xdest`) to handle setting the `xdest_base/size` and perform a `memset` on the memory region to ensure that padding bytes are properly cleared.
*   The fix also removes redundant code from `elf_init` related to `caller_xdest_*`

In summary, CVE-2016-9384 is an information disclosure vulnerability due to uninitialized memory being leaked when loading 32-bit ELF symbol tables in Xen 4.7.  An unprivileged guest can potentially use this to leak small amounts of sensitive host data.
