Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9420:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "Loose comparison false positives" within the MyBB software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The core issue involves the use of loose comparison operators (e.g., `==` instead of `===`) in PHP code. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities when comparing values of different types.
*   The specific area of code affected by this is not detailed, but the issue lies in the logic where comparisons are made.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is "false positives" in logic where a comparison is made, meaning the application might make decisions based on incorrect evaluation of data.
*   The content does not specify what the consequences of this false positive can be. Given the other vulnerabilities fixed in 1.8.8, this may lead to logic bypasses that could be exploited by an attacker in other ways.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is not specifically defined in the provided content. However, the vulnerability would be triggered when specific data or parameter is passed to the affected code during execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable part of the application and craft input that would cause the loose comparison to return an unexpected value.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more descriptive than the typical CVE description, providing the root cause and general impact.
*   This vulnerability was fixed in MyBB version 1.8.8.
