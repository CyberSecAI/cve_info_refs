The provided content relates to CVE-2016-9486.

**Root Cause:**
The ForeScout CounterACT SecureConnector agent, running with SYSTEM privileges, executes a batch file from the user's temporary directory. This directory is accessible and modifiable by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Incorrect Permissions:** The SecureConnector agent downloads and executes files, including a batch file, from the user's %TEMP% directory. This directory has permissions that allow the user to modify its contents.
- The batch file's naming convention is predictable due to its location in a user-accessible directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An unprivileged local user can gain SYSTEM privileges by replacing the legitimate batch file with a malicious one. When SecureConnector executes the batch file, it will execute the malicious code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the endpoint where the SecureConnector agent is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
- The attacker must have a user account with standard (unprivileged) access.
- The attacker needs to be able to observe the naming convention of the batch file that is being executed by SecureConnector, made possible because the batch file is in a user-accessible directory.
- The attacker needs to be able to overwrite the batch file with a malicious one before SecureConnector executes it.
