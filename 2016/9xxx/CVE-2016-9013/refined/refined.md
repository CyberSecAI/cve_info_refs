Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-9013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- **Hardcoded password for Oracle tests:** When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database settings' `TEST` dictionary, a hardcoded password was used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use of hardcoded credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a hardcoded password, making the database user easily guessable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized database access:** An attacker with network access to the database server could potentially connect using the hardcoded credentials.
- **Persistence during tests:** Although the user is normally dropped after tests, if the `manage.py test --keepdb` option was used or there was an active session (e.g., from the attacker's connection), the user would not be removed, and the attacker could maintain access.
- **Potential for arbitrary SQL execution:** If a developer connects to the database with a superuser account while using a package like django-debug-toolbar, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network access to database server:** An attacker needs network access to the Oracle database server to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must have network connectivity to the Oracle database server.
-   The attacker needs to know or guess that the Django instance has DEBUG set to True.
-   The attacker needs to know that an Oracle backend is in use.

**Additional Details (from extracted content):**

-   This vulnerability was present in Django versions before the fixes in 1.10.3, 1.9.11 and 1.8.16
-   The fix involves using a randomly generated password for the test user each time tests are run, instead of the hardcoded password.
-   The fix was applied to master and 1.10, 1.9 and 1.8 release branches.

**Summary of CVE-2016-9013:**

A vulnerability in Django's Oracle database testing setup resulted from using a hardcoded password for a temporary test user. This could be exploited by a remote attacker with network access to the database server.  The vulnerability is fixed by using random password generation for this user.
