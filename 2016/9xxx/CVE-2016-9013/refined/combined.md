*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Details

Marti Raudsepp discovered that Django incorrectly used a hardcoded password

when running tests on an Oracle database. A remote attacker could possibly

connect to the database while the tests are running and prevent the test

user with the hardcoded password from being removed. ([CVE-2016-9013](/security/CVE-2016-9013))

Aymeric Augustin discovered that Django incorrectly validated hosts when

being run with the debug setting enabled. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to perform DNS rebinding attacks. ([CVE-2016-9014](/security/CVE-2016-9014))

## Django security releases issued: 1.10.3, 1.9.11 and 1.8.16

Posted by **Tim Graham** on Nov. 1, 2016

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team released [Django 1.10.3](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.10.3/), [Django 1.9.11](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9.11/), and [1.8.16](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8.16/). These releases addresses two security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

### CVE-2016-9013: User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle

When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database
user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database
settings TEST dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow
an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.

This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using
the manage.py test --keepdb option or if the user has an active session
(such as an attacker's connection).

A randomly generated password is now used for each test run.

Thanks Marti Raudsepp for reporting the issue.

### CVE-2016-9014: DNS rebinding vulnerability when DEBUG=True

Older versions of Django don't validate the Host header against
settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS when settings.DEBUG=True. This makes them
vulnerable to a [DNS rebinding attack](http://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding/).

While Django doesn't ship a module that allows remote code execution, this is
at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if
developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect to
some production services for which there's no development instance, for
example. If a project uses a package like the django-debug-toolbar, then
the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if the
developers connect to the database with a superuser account.

settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS is now validated regardless of DEBUG. For
convenience, if ALLOWED\_HOSTS is empty and DEBUG=True, the following
variations of localhost are allowed ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']. If
your local settings file has your production ALLOWED\_HOSTS value, you must
now omit it to get those fallback values.

Thanks Aymeric Augustin for reporting the issue.

### Security Advisory: Social media fingerprinting

Along with the above security issues, we want to inform you about a "[social media
fingerprinting](https://robinlinus.github.io/socialmedia-leak/)" information
leakage technique that was recently disclosed.

If you enable redirect\_authenticated\_user on the [login views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.login),
other websites will be able to determine if their visitors are
authenticated on your site by requesting redirect URLs to image files on
your website. To avoid this, host all images and your favicon on a separate
domain that is not part of the ALLOWED\_HOSTS.

### Affected supported versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 1.10
* Django 1.9
* Django 1.8

Per our [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions), Django 1.7 and older are no longer receiving security updates.

### Resolution

Patches to resolve the issues have been applied to Django's master development branch and
the 1.10, 1.9, and 1.8 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the following commits:

* Master: [CVE-2016-9013](https://github.com/django/django/commit/da7910d4834726eca596af0a830762fa5fb2dfd9), [CVE-2016-9014](https://github.com/django/django/commit/7fe2d8d940fdddd1a02c4754008a27060c4a03e9)
* 1.10.x: [CVE-2016-9013](https://github.com/django/django/commit/34e10720d81b8d407aa14d763b6a7fe8f13b4f2e), [CVE-2016-9014](https://github.com/django/django/commit/884e113838e5a72b4b0ec9e5e87aa480f6aa4472)
* 1.9.x: [CVE-2016-9013](https://github.com/django/django/commit/4844d86c7728c1a5a3bbce4ad336a8d32304072b), [CVE-2016-9014](https://github.com/django/django/commit/45acd6d836895a4c36575f48b3fb36a3dae98d19)
* 1.8.x: [CVE-2016-9013](https://github.com/django/django/commit/70f99952965a430daf69eeb9947079aae535d2d0), [CVE-2016-9014](https://github.com/django/django/commit/c401ae9a7dfb1a94a8a61927ed541d6f93089587)

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.10.3 ([download Django 1.10.3](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.10/Django-1.10.3.tar.gz) | [1.10.3 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.10.3.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.9.11 ([download Django 1.9.11](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.9/Django-1.9.11.tar.gz) | [1.9.11 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.9.11.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.8.16 ([download Django 1.8.16](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.8/Django-1.8.16.tar.gz) | [1.8.16 checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.8.16.checksum.txt))

The PGP key ID used for these releases is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:26:24 UTC  ``` The following flaw was reported in Django:  When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database settings 'TEST' dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.  This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using the 'manage.py test --keepdb' option or if the user has an active session (such as an attacker's connection).  A randomly generated password is now used for each test run.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:26:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Django project   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:35:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1214631](attachment.cgi?id=1214631 "oracle-1.10.x.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1214631&action=edit "oracle-1.10.x.diff") oracle-1.10.x.diff   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:35:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1214632](attachment.cgi?id=1214632 "oracle-1.8.x.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1214632&action=edit "oracle-1.8.x.diff") oracle-1.8.x.diff   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:35:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1214633](attachment.cgi?id=1214633 "oracle-1.9.x.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1214633&action=edit "oracle-1.9.x.diff") oracle-1.9.x.diff   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-10-27 14:35:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1214634](attachment.cgi?id=1214634 "oracle-master.diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1214634&action=edit "oracle-master.diff") oracle-master.diff   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c6)  Andrej Nemec    2016-11-01 16:32:22 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/nov/01/security-releases/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c7)  Andrej Nemec    2016-11-01 16:35:57 UTC  ```  Created Django14 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1390685](show_bug.cgi?id=1390685 "CLOSED CANTFIX - CVE-2016-9013 CVE-2016-9014 Django14: various flaws [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c8)  Andrej Nemec    2016-11-01 16:36:10 UTC  ```  Created python-django tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1390684](show_bug.cgi?id=1390684 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9013 CVE-2016-9014 python-django: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1389414#c9)  Andrej Nemec    2016-11-01 16:37:29 UTC  ```  Created python-django tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1390687](show_bug.cgi?id=1390687 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9013 CVE-2016-9014 python-django: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ``` |  |

[python-django](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/python-django):
High-level Python web development framework

Django is a high-level web application framework that loosely follows the

 model-view-controller design pattern.

 .

 Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails, Django lets you build complex

 data-driven websites quickly and easily - Django focuses on automating as much

 as possible and adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.

 .

 Django additionally emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components;

 many generic third-party "applications" are available to enhance projects or

 to simply to reduce development time even further.

 .

 Notable features include:

  \* An object-relational mapper (ORM)

  \* Automatic admin interface

  \* Elegant URL dispatcher

  \* Form serialization and validation system

  \* Templating system

  \* Lightweight, standalone web server for development and testing

  \* Internationalization support

  \* Testing framework and client

|  |  | DNS rebinding vulnerability when ``DEBUG=True`` |
|  |  | =============================================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Older versions of Django don't validate the ``Host`` header against |
|  |  | ``settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` when ``settings.DEBUG=True``. This makes them |
|  |  | vulnerable to a `DNS rebinding attack |
|  |  | <http://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding/>`\_. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | While Django doesn't ship a module that allows remote code execution, this is |
|  |  | at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if |
|  |  | developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect to |
|  |  | some production services for which there's no development instance, for |
|  |  | example. If a project uses a package like the ``django-debug-toolbar``, then |
|  |  | the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if the |
|  |  | developers connect to the database with a superuser account. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ``settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` is now validated regardless of ``DEBUG``. For |
|  |  | convenience, if ``ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` is empty and ``DEBUG=True``, the following |
|  |  | variations of localhost are allowed ``['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']``. If |
|  |  | your local settings file has your production ``ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` value, you must |
|  |  | now omit it to get those fallback values. |

|  |  | User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle |
|  |  | ================================================================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database |
|  |  | user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database |
|  |  | settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow |
|  |  | an attacker with network access to the database server to connect. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using |
|  |  | the ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session |
|  |  | (such as an attacker's connection). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A randomly generated password is now used for each test run. |

|  |  | ================================================================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database |
|  |  | user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database |
|  |  | settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow |
|  |  | an attacker with network access to the database server to connect. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using |
|  |  | the ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session |
|  |  | (such as an attacker's connection). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A randomly generated password is now used for each test run. |

# Django 1.8.16 release notes[¶](#django-1-8-16-release-notes "Link to this heading")

*November 1, 2016*

Django 1.8.16 fixes two security issues in 1.8.15.

## User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle[¶](#user-with-hardcoded-password-created-when-running-tests-on-oracle "Link to this heading")

When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database
user. In older versions, if a password isn’t manually specified in the database
settings `TEST` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow
an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.

This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using
the `manage.py test --keepdb` option or if the user has an active session
(such as an attacker’s connection).

A randomly generated password is now used for each test run.

## DNS rebinding vulnerability when `DEBUG=True`[¶](#dns-rebinding-vulnerability-when-debug-true "Link to this heading")

Older versions of Django don’t validate the `Host` header against
`settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` when `settings.DEBUG=True`. This makes them
vulnerable to a [DNS rebinding attack](https://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding/).

While Django doesn’t ship a module that allows remote code execution, this is
at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if
developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect to
some production services for which there’s no development instance, for
example. If a project uses a package like the `django-debug-toolbar`, then
the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if the
developers connect to the database with a superuser account.

`settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS` is now validated regardless of `DEBUG`. For
convenience, if `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is empty and `DEBUG=True`, the following
variations of localhost are allowed `['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']`. If
your local settings file has your production `ALLOWED_HOSTS` value, you must
now omit it to get those fallback values.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | Django 1.8.16 fixes two security issues in 1.8.15. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle |
|  |  | ================================================================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database |
|  |  | user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database |
|  |  | settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow |
|  |  | an attacker with network access to the database server to connect. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using |
|  |  | the ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session |
|  |  | (such as an attacker's connection). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A randomly generated password is now used for each test run. |

|  |  | Django 1.9.11 fixes two security issues in 1.9.10. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle |
|  |  | ================================================================= |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database |
|  |  | user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database |
|  |  | settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow |
|  |  | an attacker with network access to the database server to connect. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using |
|  |  | the ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session |
|  |  | (such as an attacker's connection). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A randomly generated password is now used for each test run. |

|  |  | DNS rebinding vulnerability when ``DEBUG=True`` |
|  |  | =============================================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Older versions of Django don't validate the ``Host`` header against |
|  |  | ``settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` when ``settings.DEBUG=True``. This makes them |
|  |  | vulnerable to a `DNS rebinding attack |
|  |  | <http://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding/>`\_. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | While Django doesn't ship a module that allows remote code execution, this is |
|  |  | at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if |
|  |  | developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect to |
|  |  | some production services for which there's no development instance, for |
|  |  | example. If a project uses a package like the ``django-debug-toolbar``, then |
|  |  | the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if the |
|  |  | developers connect to the database with a superuser account. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ``settings.ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` is now validated regardless of ``DEBUG``. For |
|  |  | convenience, if ``ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` is empty and ``DEBUG=True``, the following |
|  |  | variations of localhost are allowed ``['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']``. If |
|  |  | your local settings file has your production ``ALLOWED\_HOSTS`` value, you must |
|  |  | now omit it to get those fallback values. |

[@timgraham](https://github.com/timgraham) I know that this commit was all about the DNS rebinding issue. But this change has some implications for many common development workflows. It means, for example, that I can no longer run `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` to test the mobile version of my site/app on the local network using a mobile device without adding the IP address of the mobile device to my `allowed_hosts` even though I'm in "development". Hey and If I test again after a few mins I may have to add a different IP to `allowed_hosts`

Sorry, something went wrong.

    setting is enabled. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to perform DNS rebinding attacks.

CVE-2017-7233

    It was discovered that is_safe_url() does not properly handle
    certain numeric URLs as safe. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to perform XSS attacks or to use a Django server as an
    open redirect.

CVE-2017-7234

    Phithon from Chaitin Tech discovered an open redirect vulnerability
    in the django.views.static.serve() view. Note that this view is not
    intended for production use.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.11-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
