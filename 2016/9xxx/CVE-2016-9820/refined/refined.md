Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from left shift operations performed on a negative value (-1) within the `libavcodec/mpegvideo_motion.c` file of the Libav library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Left shift of negative value:** The core issue is performing a left bitwise shift on the integer -1. This operation is considered undefined behavior in C/C++ and can lead to unpredictable results, including crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:**  The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application using the affected Libav library. This is evidenced by the "runtime error: left shift of negative value -1" message. 
- **Denial of Service:** Repeated crashes due to this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service for systems or applications that rely on libav for media processing.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Media Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted media file (likely an MPEG video, based on the affected file path) as input to the `avconv` tool (or any other application using the vulnerable libav library).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted media file to the application using the vulnerable libav library. This can be done through a variety of means, such as embedding the file on a website, sending it as an attachment, etc.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Affected file:** The vulnerability occurs in the file `libavcodec/mpegvideo_motion.c`.
- **Affected library version:** The vulnerability was found in `libav-11.8`, but it is likely to be present in other versions as well.
- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer enabled.
- **Test case:** A sample test case to reproduce this issue is provided in the provided github link: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00036-libav-leftshift-mpegvideo`
- **No fix:**  At the time of reporting, there was no official fix for the vulnerability from the upstream project.
- **CVE assignment:**  The CVE was assigned on December 5, 2016.
