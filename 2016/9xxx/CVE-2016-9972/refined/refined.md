- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM QRadar SIEM product is missing the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information using man-in-the-middle techniques. Users might navigate to the unencrypted version of the web application or accept invalid certificates, leading to sensitive data being transmitted unencrypted.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the IBM QRadar SIEM server. This usually means being on the same network or having some control over the network path.
