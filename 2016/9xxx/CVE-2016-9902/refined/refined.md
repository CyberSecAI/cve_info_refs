Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Pocket extension in Firefox was registering event listeners on the browser's document object instead of directly on the iframes where Pocket's UI was loaded. This caused event listeners to accept untrusted events bubbling up from the browser's content area.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** The event listeners did not verify the origin of the events, leading to processing of untrusted events.
*   **Insecure Messaging Interface:** The Pocket extension's messaging interface was unnecessarily exposed to web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary URL Opening:** Attackers could use the exposed messaging interface to open arbitrary `file://`, `chrome://` or `about:` URLs in new tabs, bypassing normal browser security restrictions. This includes opening `about:preferences#sync` or other such pages.
*   **Data Exfiltration (potential):** The exposed API could allow attackers to interact with the Pocket extension in an unauthorized way, such as detecting successful attacks due to target removal from a page or potentially using the API to leak user session identifiers by opening OAuth endpoints and retrieving final urls.
*   **Arbitrary Data Deletion:** The `deleteItem` message listener could allow attackers to delete items from a user's Pocket account.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  The attacker needs a way to execute JavaScript in the context of a web page opened in the Firefox browser.
2.  The attacker must initialize the Pocket extension by having the user click the pocket button once (or be signed in).
3.  The malicious web page can then use the `dispatchEvent` method to send a message to the Pocket extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to host a malicious web page that is opened within a user's Firefox browser.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges but needs user interaction to initialize pocket extension (or have the user already signed in)
*   The user must be using a version of Firefox where this vulnerability exists and e10s is disabled.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is considered a moderate severity issue.
* This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 50.1 and ESR 45.6.
* The fix involved restricting the message listeners to the iframe and implementing origin principal checks against `about:pocket-signup` and `about:pocket-saved`.
* It is not possible to exploit the vulnerability if E10S is enabled.
* Patches were developed for both Firefox and Firefox ESR versions to address this.
