This seems very similar to [bug 1291665](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291665 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsRefreshDriver::Tick"). I wonder why the fix from that bug didn't fix this one. [Attachment 8781395](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395 "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=edit "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=diff "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") might help but I need to check that we don't have a similar problem for independently constructed timelines (since [attachment 8781395](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395 "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=edit "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=diff "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781395) won't help with that).
The next step is probably adding some diagnostics like [bug 1291665 comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291665#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsRefreshDriver::Tick") to see if we can work out what is happening here.

In other words, we notify that the refresh driver is destroying and successfully disassociate from it, but then a subsequent change makes us re-register. What's more, this happens during some interim period where we can still successfully go from document->pres shell->pres context->refresh driver.
If that's the case, I should be able to continue debugging this on windows (and in a debug build assertions in DocumentTimeline::WillRefresh should be failing)Assignee: nobody → bbirtlesStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(bbirtles)

A few more details. There are two places where we disassociate the timeline from its refresh driver:
A) nsDocument::Reset
In this case we do:
\* mDocumentTimeline->NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying(rd);
\* mDocumentTimeline = nullptr;
B) PresShell::Destroy()
In this case we do:
\* mDocument->DeleteShell();
\* mDocument->Timeline()->NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying(rd);
Now, in DocumentTimeline, we get the refresh driver by going:
mDocument->GetShell()->GetPresContext()->RefreshDriver() (with suitable null checks along the way)
For (B), we call DeleteShell() before calling NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying, and that breaks the link between the document and the presshell so any further attempts to get the refresh driver will fail (as expected).
It looks like in this bug we hit (A) where we disassociate from the refresh driver but don't immediately break the link(s) from document to refresh driver. As a result, we end up in a state where we can still get to the refresh driver (and any change to the animation will cause us to re-associate with it, despite the fact that it will probably disappear soon).
Stepping back, there seems to be an even bigger problem in that script-created timelines never get the NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying message. So how do they make sure they are disconnected from their refresh driver when it is going away?
Looking into how things normally get destroyed we have:
PresShell::Destroy()
If mDocument is set:
- mDocument->DeleteShell();
Sets mPresShell = nullptr;
- Calls mDocument->Timeline()->NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying(rd);
If mPresContext is set:
- Calls nsPresContext::DetachShell()
- Calls Disconnect on its refresh driver (after nulling out mShell)
nsPresContext::~nsPresContext()
- Calls DetachShell()
- Calls Disconnect it its refresh driver (after nulling out mShell)
- Calls Destroy()
- Sets mRefreshDriver = null
For nsDocument::Reset, I think the idea here was basically that we should make sure that the object identity of document.timeline changes when we call reset. As a result, I think it's probably fine if the timeline from the old document can somehow be resurrected. Rather than try to fix that, we need to fix the general case of timelines that are not the document timeline, yet which might be watching the refresh driver associated with a pres shell that has been destroyed.
Basically, I think we need to store a hash of timelines on the pres shell so we can clear them out in PresShell::Destroy (at the point where we currently call mDocument->Timeline()->NotifyRefreshDriverDestroying). Alternatively, I guess we could stick that map on the document and iterate over it in nsDocument::DeleteShell()?

This patch thoroughly reworks how we track timelines so we can safely unregister them from the refresh driver when it disappears.
It's a fairly large patch so I think we might try something simpler for aurora. Fortunately, the ability to create extra timelines is not enabled on aurora so we could probably just include something like [attachment 8781395](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395 "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=edit "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8781395&action=diff "Ignore a refresh driver marked as destroyed in DocumentTimeline") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1291665&attachment=8781395). Or, even simpler still, we could possibly just null out mDocument when the refresh driver dies (and sprinkle a few null checks about).

One part of this patch I'm not sure about is the change where we stop unregistering the default document timeline from the refresh driver when we reset the document.
I made this change as a simplification since we originally only added that code because, once clearing the default document timeline we would no longer be able to reach it to tell it to disassociate itself when the pres shell is being destroyed. This bug reveals that even if we do that, however, the document it able to re-add itself. As a result this patch holds a separate list of timelines that it uses specifically for disassociating them from the refresh driver when it is about to be destroyed. That should make the handling of all timelines consistent and simple.
However, it may be better to more aggressively disassociate timelines when a document is reset. For example, clearing refresh driver observers sooner may improve performance / battery usage---but I think that would only matter when resetting documents and I'm not sure how common that is? Also, if we clear the connection between a timeline and a document we might free it up for GC sooner?
If we decide to go that route I think we could:
\* Iterate over all the timelines when we reset the document (just like we do when we destroy the pres shell)
\* Null out DocumentTimeline::mDocument (the wrapper cache parent object is AnimationTimeline::mWindow so we don't need to keep this reference) -- this is to ensure we do re-register with the refresh driver
\* Add necessary null checks for mDocument within DocumentTimeline

This is an alternative approach that I suspect is better (and more consistent with the patch I intend to land on aurora).
In this patch we record all documents created with the document they use to look up the refresh driver. Then, when either the document is reset or the refresh driver is destroyed, we go through the list of documents, disassociate them from the refresh driver, and break the link with the document so they can no longer re-register with the refresh driver.
I'm not entirely clear if it's a good idea to neuter all timelines when we call document.reset() but maybe it's ok?

So this test fails when we reset the document, but then trigger a change on an animation connected to that document's timeline. I \*think\* it's only possible to trigger a change on an animation after the document is reset using the animation API. If that's the case, this goes back to Firefox 48 which is the first release where we shipped Element.animate ([bug 1245000](/show_bug.cgi?id=1245000 "RESOLVED FIXED - Ship Element.animate")).Flags: needinfo?(bbirtles)

[Approach B: Store timelines on the document](attachment.cgi?id=8798326&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8798326&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1302973&attachment=8798326)

Approach B was failing in dom/animation/test/document-timeline/test\_document-timeline.html because we'd disconnect from the document meaning that document.timeline.currentTime would return null after we destroyed the pres shell. I don't think it should do that.
After looking into it, it looks like I was complicating this bug more that necessary. The fundamental cause is that in [bug 1232829](/show_bug.cgi?id=1232829 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsRefreshDriver::RemoveRefreshObserver] with CSS transition, navigation") we came across a case where the pres shell was destroyed but we failed to unregister from the refresh driver because the call to nsDocument::Reset broke the connection from document to timeline (so we couldn't reach the timeline to tell it to unregister). To fix that we make the timeline unregister from the refresh driver in nsDocument::Reset.
\*However\* if after doing that we modify an animation attached to the timeline, it can cause the timeline to re-register with the refresh driver and then we have the same problem, i.e. we can't reach the timeline to tell it to unregister from the refresh driver when the pres shell disappears.
Furthermore, while investigating I notice that we never take care to unregister script-generated timelines when the presshell is destroyed. Fortunately, that feature is only enabled on non-release builds so the damage is limited but we should fix that while we're at it.
This updated patch should fix both problems by:
\* Recording all timelines against the document they use to fetch their refresh driver
\* \*Not\* clearing this reference when a document is reset (so we can always reach these timelines, even if they get re-added somehow)
\* Notifying all timelines when the presshell is being destroyed
I'm still not sure if we should forcefully disconnect all timelines from their document when it is reset. Originally I tried doing this but was a bit too eager and also did this when the presshell was destroyed which caused dom/animation/test/document-timeline/test\_document-timeline.html to fail. Perhaps we can try doing that in a separate bug (but only for resetting the document). For now, this should be enough to fix the crash.

Somewhat easily. Once you recognize that this is a security-related patch you could infer that it has something to do with the interaction between timelines, the refresh driver and documents being reset. Of course you'd still need to be able to trigger GC to expose the bug.

Yes ([attachment 8798683](/attachment.cgi?id=8798683 "Fix rebased for aurora/beta") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8798683&action=edit "Fix rebased for aurora/beta") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8798683&action=diff "Fix rebased for aurora/beta") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1302973&attachment=8798683) and [attachment 8798684](/attachment.cgi?id=8798684 "Fix rebased for release") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8798684&action=edit "Fix rebased for release") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8798684&action=diff "Fix rebased for release") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1302973&attachment=8798684)) although I have yet to test these, only that they apply cleanly.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely. I am currently running it through try (<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=3afb34a77846>) with a patch title that does not clearly suggest a security bug.

Fix rebased for aurora/beta
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: Ultimately it was introduced by [bug 1195180](/show_bug.cgi?id=1195180 "RESOLVED FIXED - Tick animations from their timeline") but only shipped to release channels by [bug 1245000](/show_bug.cgi?id=1245000 "RESOLVED FIXED - Ship Element.animate").
[User impact if declined]: Security vulnerability, unpatched use after free.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: Landed on m-c about 15 hours ago and seems to be ok. I've pushed to try just now for aurora[1]/beta[2] and it seems to be ok.
[Risks and why]: No known obvious risks.

Hmm, is this yet another variant of what I fixed already...doesn't seem like.
If I read the code right, nothing keeps mFirstChild alive

node\_prepend\_crash.diff
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not quite sure, since isn't clear to me whether we actually end up using the deleted object in an unsafe way. But at least the patch does pinpoint to the issue quite clearly.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Commit message could be
"[Bug 1308922](/show_bug.cgi?id=1308922 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore"), ensure expected DOM tree operations when calling prepend, r=ehsan"
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
not esr45, but release/beta/aurora
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[bug 911477](/show_bug.cgi?id=911477 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement DOM4 methods: prepend(), append(), before(), after() and replaceWith()")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The patch should apply everywhere
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Should be super safe.

It looks like this might be a regression from [bug 911477](/show_bug.cgi?id=911477 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement DOM4 methods: prepend(), append(), before(), after() and replaceWith()"), which landed in 49. Is that right? That's when the code was added.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for investigating and fixing this. Maybe these methods could be made to return already\_AddRefed()? That would prevent people from introducing new instances of this in the future. It would be a little weird, I suppose.

remove\_node\_crash.diff
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
I think quite easily
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Commit message would be, "[Bug 1301777](/show_bug.cgi?id=1301777 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore"), use nsCOMPtr for stack variables, r=mccr8"
Can't figure out anything which doesn't pinpoint exactly what the issue is :(
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
49, 50
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
bug
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Should apply to trunk and aurora
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Should be super safe

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
