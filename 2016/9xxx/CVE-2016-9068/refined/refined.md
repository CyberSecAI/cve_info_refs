  "CVE-2016-9068": {
    "description": "A use-after-free during web animations when working with timelines resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in `nsRefreshDriver::Tick` related to how timelines are managed during web animations and document resets, leading to a crash when a freed object is accessed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Triggering specific web animations that involve timelines and document resets. The provided HTML testcase demonstrates how the vulnerability is triggered.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to cause a specific sequence of events in the browser, including web animations, document resets and garbage collection"
  },
 "CVE-2016-9067": {
    "description": "Two use-after-free errors during DOM operations resulting in potentially exploitable crashes.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to use-after-free errors in `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore` when performing DOM manipulations, specifically related to `replaceWith` and `after` methods. The improper handling of node references during these operations can lead to accessing freed memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Potentially exploitable crashes due to accessing freed memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Crafting a specific sequence of DOM operations, using `replaceWith` and `after` methods, combined with an event listener to trigger a crash. The provided HTML testcase shows how the crash is triggered.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the DOM, set event listeners and cause garbage collection to expose the vulnerability."
  },
   "CVE-2016-9069": {
    "description": "A heap-use-after-free error in `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore`.",
     "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a heap-use-after-free error in `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore` specifically when calling the `prepend` method. The issue arises because `mFirstChild` isn't kept alive when it is being prepended.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
       "Use-after-free"
      ],
    "impact": "Potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Exploitation involves manipulating the DOM using the `prepend` method in a specific way that triggers the use-after-free. The HTML testcase in the bug report illustrates how to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the DOM and use the `prepend` method which leads to the use-after-free."
