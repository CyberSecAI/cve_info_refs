Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9831:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `parseSWF_RGBA` function within the `parser.c` file of the libming library. This function is responsible for parsing RGBA color data within SWF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The `parseSWF_RGBA` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
- Insufficient bounds checking: The code does not properly validate the number of gradients in a `SWF_MORPHGRADIENT` structure, leading to an out-of-bounds write. Specifically, the code expects a maximum of 8 gradients but allows parsing more.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code execution: A heap-based buffer overflow can be exploited to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of Service: The overflow can also cause a crash of the `listswf` utility.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious SWF file: An attacker can craft a malicious SWF file with an excessive number of gradients in a `SWF_MORPHGRADIENT` structure.
- Direct `listswf` call: If a web application directly calls the `listswf` binary to parse untrusted SWF files, this can be an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and provide a malicious SWF file.
- The targeted application or system must be using the vulnerable `listswf` utility from the libming library to process the malicious SWF file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The affected version of libming is 0.4.7.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.4.8
- The commit fix for the vulnerability is <https://github.com/libming/libming/commit/94b25ed1b038b5392fdaa6b845f6f501aba54130> which addresses cases where `fgetc()` returns unexpected EOF by immediately exiting the program.
- A reproducer is available at <https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00076-libming-heapoverflow-parseSWF_RGBA>.
