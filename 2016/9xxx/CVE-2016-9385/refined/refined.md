Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the x86 segment base write emulation within the Xen hypervisor. Specifically, when writing to the FS and GS register base MSRs, or when using the `WRFSBASE` and `WRGSBASE` instructions, the hypervisor failed to perform checks to ensure that the input values were canonical addresses. Canonical addresses are required to avoid a General Protection (#GP) fault. The removal of the recovery code that previously guarded against #GP faults exposed the vulnerability when the use of these instructions by the hypervisor was enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing canonical address checks:** The core issue is the absence of proper validation of addresses before writing to segment base registers. This oversight allows a crafted, non-canonical address to trigger a #GP fault.
- **Exposure through hypervisor-enabled instructions:** The vulnerability was exposed when the hypervisor was enabled to use specific instructions for writing to segment base registers, which was not previously guarded by the recovery code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest administrator can exploit this vulnerability to crash the host system, resulting in a denial of service. This can be achieved by supplying non-canonical address to the vulnerable write operations, triggering a #GP fault and causing the host hypervisor to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest Administrator:** The attack vector is a malicious guest administrator within a paravirtualized (PV) guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Administrator Control:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within a PV guest.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute code within the PV guest that can trigger the vulnerable segment register write operations with non-canonical addresses.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Systems:** Xen versions 4.4 and onwards are vulnerable, while Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not affected.
- **Paravirtualization (PV) Guest Specific:** Only x86 PV guests are vulnerable; x86 HVM guests and ARM systems are not susceptible to this particular issue.
- **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to apply the provided patches, which reintroduce the canonical address checks. Running only HVM guests would also avoid this issue. Additionally, for PV guests, limiting the guest's ability to load kernel code or execute code at kernel privilege can reduce the attack surface.
- **Patch Availability:** Patches are provided for Xen unstable, 4.7.x, 4.6.x, 4.5.x and 4.4.x.
