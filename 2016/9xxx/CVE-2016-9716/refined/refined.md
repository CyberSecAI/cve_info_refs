- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability exists in the MDM User Interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute malicious and unauthorized actions by transmitting requests from a user that the website trusts. This could result in unauthorized modifications to data, settings or other actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a logged in user into clicking on a malicious link, or visiting a malicious web page that makes a cross-site request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user into making a request. The user needs to have an active session with the vulnerable application. The attacker can be external and remote to the application.
