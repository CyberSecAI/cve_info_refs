Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries in IBM QRadar SIEM. This allows for arbitrary modification of backend SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to view sensitive information stored in the backend database.
*  **Command Execution:** In certain scenarios, successful SQL injection could lead to command execution on the server, though the document doesn't provide details of these scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network based, as a remote attacker can send specially crafted SQL statements to the vulnerable IBM QRadar SIEM instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote network access to the vulnerable IBM QRadar SIEM system.
*  **No Credentials Required:** Based on the CVSS vector, no privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of the CVE:**

CVE-2016-9728 is a SQL injection vulnerability in IBM QRadar SIEM 7.2.n. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to send malicious SQL statements to the system, potentially leading to unauthorized data access and, in some cases, command execution. The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5. A patch is available to address this vulnerability.
