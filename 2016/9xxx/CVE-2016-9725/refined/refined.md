- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows web sites to request resources from external sites without proper access control, which is a vulnerability related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability allows for unauthorized access of resources via a web browser, leading to potential information leakage, however the specific resources are not specified. The CVSS vector indicates a low confidentiality impact with no integrity or availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious web page could use an improperly configured CORS policy to request and potentially obtain sensitive information from the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that a user with access to the vulnerable QRadar instance can visit.
