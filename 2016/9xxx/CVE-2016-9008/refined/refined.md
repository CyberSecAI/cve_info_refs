- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Agent Relay ActiveMQ Broker JMX interface in IBM UrbanCode Deploy is accessible without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to the JMX interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can access the Agent Relay ActiveMQ Broker JMX interface and execute plugins on the agent. This could lead to unauthorized actions and potential compromise of the agent.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the vulnerable IBM UrbanCode Deploy instance is required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
