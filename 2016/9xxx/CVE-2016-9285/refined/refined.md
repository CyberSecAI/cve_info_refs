{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the addressController.php file, specifically within the edit() function. The code allows users to edit addresses based on whether they are an admin or editing their own account. However, the original logic was flawed and did not properly check if the user had the proper permissions to edit an address resulting in privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient authorization check",
    "Privilege escalation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially edit any user's address information by exploiting the insufficient authorization check in the edit() function. This could lead to unauthorized modification of sensitive information like user addresses.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Directly accessing the edit function with a modified user ID."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application to exploit this vulnerability."
