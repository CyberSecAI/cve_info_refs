The provided content is related to a local denial of service vulnerability in Micro Focus Rumba 9.4, but it does not reference CVE-2016-9176. It appears to be a separate issue, as the provided content explicitly states "CVE: N/A".

**Root Cause:** Multiple stack overflow vulnerabilities in Micro Focus Rumba 9.4. The vulnerabilities are triggered when the `send.exe` and `receive.exe` utilities receive overly long strings as input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack overflows in `send.exe` and `receive.exe`.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Local denial of service. The exploit overwrites the SEH (Structured Exception Handler) and NSEH (Next Structured Exception Handler), leading to application crash.

**Attack Vectors:** Executing the vulnerable `send.exe` and `receive.exe` utilities with crafted long string arguments as file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local access to the vulnerable system with the ability to execute command-line utilities (`send.exe` and `receive.exe`) present in the RUMBA installation directory.
