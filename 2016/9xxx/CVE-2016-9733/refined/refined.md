Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The weakness is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
- Alter the intended functionality of the web UI.
- Potentially lead to the disclosure of user credentials within a trusted session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface, where a user can embed malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to embed malicious javascript in the Web UI, which implies having some sort of access to the system, or ability to inject it remotely. User interaction is required since the malicious script is not executed until a user interacts with the malicious content. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and a user interaction (UI:R) for successful exploitation.
