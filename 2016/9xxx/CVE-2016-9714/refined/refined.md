- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure JSF ViewState in the MDM Business Admin User Interface, leading to cross-site request forgery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) due to insecure handling of JSF ViewState.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts. This could lead to unauthorized modifications or actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). Exploitation requires a user to be tricked into performing an action, implying user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N). The attacker needs to trick the user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim.
