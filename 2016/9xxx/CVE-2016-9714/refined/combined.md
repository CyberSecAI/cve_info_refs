### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management is vulnerable to a Insecure JSF ViewState found in MDM Busines Admin User Interface which could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2016-9714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9714) IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery which could allow an attacker to execute malicious and unauthorized actions transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119727> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability is known to affect the following offerings:

| **Affected IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server** | **Affected Versions** |
| --- | --- |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 10.1 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 11.0 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 11.3 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 11.4 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 11.5 |
| IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management | 11.6 |

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the fix as soon as practical. Please see below for information on how to fix.

If you have customized the UI and you already have the source code available in RAD you can skip step#1 and #2.

1. Locate the com.ibm.mdm.sample.ba.webapp.ear.zip file from MDM sample.

2. Import the projects into RAD and follow [Downloading, configuring and deploying the sample](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.5.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.dat.stdshp.doc/t_download_configure_ear.html)

3. Open web.xml from **CustomerBusinessAdminWeb** so

- enable **com.sun.faces.enableHighAvailability** in **Web.xml**

Refer the code below

<context-param>

<description>

If set to true while server-side state saving is being used, a serialized representation

of the view is stored on the server. This allows for failover and sever clustering support.

Default is false. This parameter is not available in JSF 1.0.</description>

<param-name>com.sun.faces.enableHighAvailability</param-name>

<param-value>**true**</param-value>

</context-param>

- After the code changes do build all

4. Export CustomerBusinessAdmin as EAR

Then From RAD, File -> Export -> Ear File (Under Java EE)

in EAR Export wizard

- select EAR Project name as 'CustomerBusinessAdmin'

- Then provide the destination , that earfile name

5. Deploy the this new exported EAR on server

Note: Before installing EAR on server make sure ClientAuthentication.properties and mdmUIConfiguration.properties of propertiesUI.jar have valid connection properties.
