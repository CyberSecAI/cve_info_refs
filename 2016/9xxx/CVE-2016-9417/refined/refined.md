Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `fetch_remote_file()` function of MyBB. This function is used to fetch remote files, but it was susceptible to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The `fetch_remote_file()` function did not properly validate or restrict the URLs it was accessing. This allowed an attacker to potentially make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external addresses, thus leaking internal information or interacting with internal services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use the vulnerable function to make requests to internal services or hosts, thus accessing sensitive information that was not intended to be exposed.
- **Access to Internal Resources:**  By crafting specific URLs, attackers could potentially interact with other services or servers in the internal network, which could lead to further exploitation.
- **Potential Denial of Service:** If an attacker can make the vulnerable function repeatedly request an internal resource, it could cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could provide a malicious URL to `fetch_remote_file()`. This URL can be any arbitrary internal or external URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trigger the `fetch_remote_file()` function with a controlled URL. The exact way an attacker does this will depend on the specific implementation within MyBB, however, it is likely possible to do so via user-controlled settings or functionality.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by dawid_golunski.
- It was fixed in MyBB version 1.8.8.
- The fix included adding `$config['disallowed_remote_hosts']` and `$config['disallowed_remote_addresses']` variables to `inc/config.php`, which allows the administrator to configure which hosts and addresses MyBB shouldn't attempt to access, thus limiting the scope of the vulnerability.
