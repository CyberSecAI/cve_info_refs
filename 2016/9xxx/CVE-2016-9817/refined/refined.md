Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from how the Xen hypervisor on ARM architecture handles asynchronous aborts (SError on ARMv8) triggered by a guest OS. Specifically, a guest can cause an asynchronous abort by accessing memory-mapped hardware in a non-conventional way, even if device pass-through isn't configured directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The hypervisor, when encountering an asynchronous abort (specifically, an external abort indicated by the `ESR_EL2.EA` bit being set in the exception syndrome register), currently crashes the host. This behavior is a weakness that a guest OS can exploit.
- The hypervisor may grant guest OSes access to memory-mapped hardware for performance reasons related to hardware virtualization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest OS can induce a host crash by triggering an asynchronous abort, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A guest OS, whether malicious or compromised, manipulates memory mapped hardware in a way that causes a asynchronous abort in the hypervisor.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a guest administrator or by untrusted code within the guest kernel accessing MMIO.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs control over a guest operating system running on an affected Xen hypervisor on an ARM architecture.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate memory access from within the guest OS.
- The attacker needs to be able to access MMIO (memory mapped I/O) within the guest OS.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this issue involves modifying the Xen hypervisor to detect and respond to these guest-triggered asynchronous aborts correctly. In the provided patch, the hypervisor is changed to crash the guest instead of the host when such an abort is detected.  The code changes check the `ESR_EL2.EA` bit to identify external aborts and then invoke `domain_crash_synchronous()` function to crash the guest domain.
- The advisory indicates that the vulnerability is specific to ARM-based systems running Xen and does not affect x86 systems.
- Mitigation strategies include running guest kernels controlled by the host that do not expose MMIO to user space. This measure however can be bypassed by untrusted guest administrators if they can load code in the kernel or use other mechanisms that allow code execution at kernel level.
- The issue was publicly known and had been fixed in KVM before this Xen advisory.
