Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the default configuration of the Docker Engine within Cisco CloudCenter Orchestrator (CCO). Specifically, the Docker Engine's TCP port 2375 is open and bound to the local address 0.0.0.0 (any interface) by default. This allows unauthenticated access to the Docker Engine from any network interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication required to interact with the Docker Engine's API over TCP port 2375.
*   **Open Port:** The Docker Engine's management port (2375) being exposed to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of only localhost (127.0.0.1) exposes the service unnecessarily.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The open Docker port allows an attacker to launch docker containers with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges by deploying and running malicious Docker containers on the affected CCO system.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise, including the ability to modify, steal, or destroy data, disrupt services, or use the system as a launchpad for further attacks.
*  **Installation of Malicious Containers:** Attackers can install malicious docker containers

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected CCO system on port 2375. Since it is open on all interfaces (0.0.0.0), it could be accessible from the local network or potentially from the internet if not protected by firewalls or network configurations.
*  **Unauthenticated Docker API Access:** Attackers can use the Docker API to interact with the open port, without authentication to deploy malicious containers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to reach the CCO system on TCP port 2375.
*  **Docker API knowledge:** The attacker must be able to utilize the docker api to launch containers

**Additional Notes:**
*  The vulnerability has been exploited in a limited number of cases.
* A Snort rule (41093) has been created for this vulnerability
*  A fix has been released in Cisco CloudCenter Orchestrator 4.6.2 patch release.
* Workaround is to bind the docker port to localhost (127.0.0.1).
