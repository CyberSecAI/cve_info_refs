- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `as_sindex__simatch_list_by_set_binid` function due to the use of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking when constructing a key. The size of the key is determined by a set name string provided in the packet and a bin ID. If the set name is too long, it overflows a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). Insufficient bounds checking when using `sprintf`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address, to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the Aerospike Database Server on the listening port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to know the IP address and port of the Aerospike database server. The attacker must also craft a specific message format for the server.
