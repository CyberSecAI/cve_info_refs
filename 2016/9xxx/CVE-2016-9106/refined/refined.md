    "description": "Memory leak in the v9fs_write function in hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging failure to free an IO vector.",

    "impact": "Denial of service (memory consumption and potential QEMU process crash)",
