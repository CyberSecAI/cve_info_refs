Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9122:

**CVE-2016-9122:** This CVE ID is associated with the vulnerability described as "Exploiting multiple signatures" in the provided content.

**Root Cause:**
The `go-jose` library supported messages with multiple signatures, but the API did not clearly indicate which signature was valid during verification. This could lead to a user of the library mistakenly using header values from an unverified signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of clarity in multi-signature handling:** The API did not explicitly return which signature was successfully verified.
- **Potential for signature confusion:** Users could mistakenly use data from an invalid signature, such as protected header values, leading to potential security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Incorrect data usage:** An attacker could craft a JWS message with multiple signatures, where one signature is valid and others are malicious. The application might use header values from a malicious signature, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
- **Bypass of intended security checks:** If the application relies on the values in the verified header for critical operations or security checks, an attacker could manipulate those values through the malicious signatures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JWS message with multiple signatures:** An attacker would craft a JWS message containing multiple signatures, at least one of which is valid and another one that is malicious.
- **Targeting vulnerable applications:** The attacker targets applications that are using the vulnerable `go-jose` library for multi-signature verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a JWS message:** The attacker needs to be able to create a JWS message with multiple signatures.
- **Knowledge of target application behavior:** The attacker needs to understand how the application using `go-jose` processes the verified signature and its headers to craft a suitable attack.

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit diffs (`2c5656adca9909843c4ff50acf1d2cf8f32da7e6`) show the changes made to address the vulnerability, specifically in `crypter.go`, `crypter_test.go`, `jws.go`, `signing.go` and `signing_test.go`. The changes primarily focus on:

- Modifying `Decrypt` and `Verify` functions to return errors if more than one recipient or signature is present, indicating that these methods don't support multi-recipient/signature scenarios.
- Introducing `DecryptMulti` and `VerifyMulti` methods that return the index of the successful decryption/verification, the corresponding header, and the plaintext payload. This provides clear indication to the user about which signature was valid.
- Adding new test cases to verify the correct behavior of `DecryptMulti` and `VerifyMulti` methods.

This commit provides a fix for the ambiguity of multiple signatures/recipients by explicitly making it a separate method, and adding additional returns.
