| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c0)  Bharti Kundal    2016-12-22 20:40:22 UTC  ``` libxml2: out-of-bounds read   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2016-12-22 20:44:38 UTC  ``` Are there any details available for this? Upsteam bug, commit reference?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c3)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-03 11:03:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Salvatore Bonaccorso from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c2)) > Are there any details available for this? Upsteam bug, commit reference?  Referring to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408302#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=1408302#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9596 libxml2: stack exhaustion while parsing xml files in recovery mode (unfixed CVE-2016-3627 in JBCS)")   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-12 10:10:28 UTC  ``` [CVE-2016-9598](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9598) was assigned for incomplete fix of [CVE-2016-4483](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-4483), however that was closed as duplicate of [CVE-2016-3627](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3627). That actually makes this CVE a duplicate of [CVE-2016-9596](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9596) since that one was assigned for incomplete fix of [CVE-2016-3627](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3627).  Hence I suggest to close this one as duplicate of [CVE-2016-9596](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9596). Would that work for you?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2017-02-23 17:27:23 UTC  ``` This CVE id is for the same issue as [CVE-2016-4483](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-4483)  ([bug 1332820](show_bug.cgi?id=1332820 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-4483 libxml2: out-of-bounds read")).  This additional CVE was assigned because the original issue was listed as fixed in RHSA-2016:2957 for the Red Hat JBoss Core Services:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>  However, that erratum actually failed to include the fix for the issue.  Therefore, this new CVE is specific to the Red Hat JBoss Core Services product and is better described as: missing/incorrect fix for [CVE-2016-4483](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-4483)  in the Red Hat JBoss Core Services.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1408306#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-08-16 16:08:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2018:2486 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2486)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1388392#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-25 08:41:12 UTC  ```  When curl is built with libidn to handle International Domain Names (IDNA), it translates them to puny code for DNS resolving using the IDNA 2003 standard, while IDNA 2008 is the modern and up-to-date IDNA standard.  This misalignment causes problems with for example domains using the German ß character (known as the Unicode Character 'LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S') which is used at times in the .de TLD and is translated differently in the two IDNA standards, leading to users potentially and unknowingly issuing network transfer requests to the wrong host.  For example, `straße.de` is translated into `strasse.de` using IDNA 2003 but is translated into `xn--strae-oqa.de` using IDNA 2008. Needless to say, those host names could very well resolve to different addresses and be two completely independent servers. IDNA 2008 is mandatory for .de domains.  curl is not alone with this problem, as there's currently a big flux in the world of network user-agents about which IDNA version to support and use.  This name problem exists for DNS-using protocols in curl, but only when built to use libidn.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 09:39:48 UTC  ``` The compile_bracket_matchingpath function in pcre_jit_compile.c in PCRE through 8.x before revision 1680 (e.g., the PHP 7.1.1 bundled version) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted regular expression.  Upstream patch:  <https://vcs.pcre.org/pcre?view=revision&revision=1680>  Upstream bug:  <https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2035>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-02-21 10:28:57 UTC  ``` Created glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425394](show_bug.cgi?id=1425394 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-6004 glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1425392](show_bug.cgi?id=1425392 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425396](show_bug.cgi?id=1425396 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-glib2: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1425393](show_bug.cgi?id=1425393 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-pcre: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425391](show_bug.cgi?id=1425391 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2017-6004 mingw-pcre: pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   Created pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1425395](show_bug.cgi?id=1425395 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-6004 pcre: Out-of-bounds read in compile_bracket_matchingpath function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c2)  Richard W.M. Jones    2017-02-21 11:29:14 UTC  ``` virt-p2v (an ISO that we ship in RHEL 7) contains an embedded copy of pcre.  However it does NOT call pcre_jit_compile explicitly.  Do you know if this function can be called implicitly (eg from pcre_compile, which virt-p2v does call)?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c3)  Petr Pisar    2017-02-21 13:58:13 UTC  ``` PCRE does not use JIT by default. An application must request JIT explicitly by calling pcre_study() (pcre16_study() or pcre32_study()) with some of PCRE_STUDY_JIT_* values in the second parameter.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1425365#c4)  Fedora Update System    2017-02-22 17:52:06 UTC  ``` pcre-8.40-2.fc24 has been pushed to the Fedora 24 stable repository.
