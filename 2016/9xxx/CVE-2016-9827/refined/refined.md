Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-9827:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `_iprintf` function within `outputtxt.c` of the libming library. The issue arises when parsing a SWF file with a `SWF_PROTECT` block. The `parseSWF_PROTECT` function reads bytes using `readBytes`, but then overwrites `parserrec->Password` with `readString` if a length other than zero is indicated. The `outputSWF_PROTECT` function then attempts to output the password using `_iprintf`, leading to the overflow if a crafted string is provided through the SWF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `_iprintf` function.
- Incorrect handling of password strings within the `SWF_PROTECT` block parsing in the `parser.c` file. Specifically, the `readBytes` allocated memory is not freed and is overwritten using `readString`. This results in the allocation of a fixed size buffer for the password and subsequent attempt to write a potentially longer string into the allocated memory through the `_iprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the overflow can overwrite critical memory regions.
- In the context of this issue, a specially crafted SWF file could cause the `listswf` utility (or any application using libming to process untrusted SWF) to crash or potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerable code path during parsing and output processing within `listswf`.
- The `SWF_PROTECT` block within an SWF file contains a password string, the parsing of which leads to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted SWF file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of libming.
- No specific privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability other than the ability to supply the crafted SWF to `listswf`.
