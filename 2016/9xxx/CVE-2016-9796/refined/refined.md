Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that certain Object Request Brokers (ORBs) within Alcatel Lucent's Omnivista 8770 software are exposed and can be invoked without authentication. These ORBs provide access to server-side interfaces that can be misused to achieve remote code execution. The lack of a proper session mechanism allows for replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated Access: The ORBs are accessible without requiring authentication, which allows an attacker to send commands directly.
- Replay Attacks: The software does not have a proper session mechanism and is vulnerable to replay attacks. The same requests can be replayed from a different machine without authenticating.
- Insecure Interface Access: The exposed interfaces allow an attacker to perform actions like scheduling tasks and executing arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by abusing the exposed ORB interfaces, leading to complete system compromise.
- System-Level Privileges: The Omnivista software runs with system privileges, resulting in the attacker gaining the same level of access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system on TCP port 30024 to interact with the vulnerable ORB interface.
- GIOP Protocol: The exploit is achieved by sending specially crafted GIOP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the Omnivista server on port 30024.
- GIOP Knowledge: Understanding the structure of GIOP packets is necessary to craft the exploit.
- Scripting Skills:  The attacker needs scripting skills to automate the process of sending the GIOP packets and to chain requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The attack involves a sequence of three GIOP requests:
   1.  `AddJobSet`: Adds a job set using the `SchedulerInterface`, which is an object key on the server.
   2.  `AddJob`: Adds a task within the previously created job set. The task involves executing a command like `cmd.exe`, with the payload containing a PowerShell script to download and execute a malicious script.
   3.  `ExecuteNow`: Executes the created task.
-  The lack of proper session management allows an attacker to replay the requests.
-  The vulnerability was tested against Omnivista 8770 versions 2.0, 2.6 and 3.0.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor's initial mitigation suggestion was to use firewall rules to restrict access to the Omnivista server.
- The provided exploit script is written in Python and requires some manipulation of hex data.
- The exploit uses `nbtscan` to obtain the NetBIOS name of the target system.
- The exploit chain involves creating a jobset, adding a task that executes a command (such as `cmd.exe` with an argument), and then executing that job.
- The exploit leverages the `SchedulerInterface`.
