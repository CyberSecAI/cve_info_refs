Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `vmnc_handle_wmvi_rectangle` function within the VMware VMnc video file format decoding plugin of GStreamer. This occurs during the allocation of the render buffer where the calculation of memory allocation size is done using multiplication of attacker controlled `width`, `height` and `bytes_per_pixel` without sufficient sanitization leading to the overflow and subsequent heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `dec->format.width * dec->format.height * dec->format.bytes_per_pixel` can result in an integer overflow due to attacker-controlled width and height values, leading to a smaller than intended memory allocation.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The smaller buffer allocated based on the overflowed integer value is used by the rendering function which attempts to write data based on the expected buffer size, leading to an out-of-bounds write on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** A remote attacker can cause an application using GStreamer to crash due to the heap buffer overflow and out-of-bounds write.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It is possible that an attacker could leverage the heap overflow to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application. This is achieved by carefully crafting the input file and using heap grooming techniques to overwrite sensitive data on the heap.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drive-by Download**: Visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious media file
*  **Direct File Access**: opening a crafted media file in applications that use the affected GStreamer plugin.
*  **Email Attachment**: Receiving the crafted file via email and opening it in an application using the affected plugin.
*   **Media Playback:** Playing a crafted video file.
*   **Thumbnailing:** A malicious media file can be automatically processed, triggering the vulnerability when the system generates thumbnails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote (e.g., through a malicious website) or local (e.g., by sending a malicious file).
*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create or control a malicious file in the VMware VMnc video file format.
*   **User Interaction (Potentially):** While the auto-downloading of files may trigger this vulnerability, other attack vectors like file opening might require some user interaction (eg: previewing).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects GStreamer's VMware VMnc video file format decoding plugin (`libgstvmnc.so`).
*   The `tracker` software in Fedora, which indexes downloaded files, can trigger this vulnerability by attempting to generate thumbnails for media files.
*   The vulnerability is present in both gstreamer and gstreamer1 versions of the plugin.
*   The flaw is also present in Ubuntu distributions.
*   Upstream has provided a patch that implements a sanity check for width and height to prevent the overflow. This patch also initializes the allocated buffer with zeros.
*   Mitigation was also provided by removing the vulnerable `libgstvmnc.so`.
*  Red Hat provided security updates to address the vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
