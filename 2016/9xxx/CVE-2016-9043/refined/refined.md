- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the EMF parsing functionality of CorelDRAW X8.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specific EMF records (e.g., EMR_CREATEBRUSHINDIRECT, EMR_CREATEPEN, etc.). The vulnerability is located in the `CdrGfx.dll` library. The attacker can control the destination address of the write operation by manipulating the `ihBrush` value within the EMF file, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a specially crafted EMF file to the victim. When the victim opens the file with CorelDRAW X8, the vulnerable code is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious EMF file to the victim. No special privileges are needed. The victim needs to open the crafted file.
