    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the `horizontalDifference` function within the `tif_pixarlog.c` file of libtiff 4.0.6. Specifically, the function writes beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.",

        "Heap-based buffer overflow"

      "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash or memory corruption, and may potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted TIFF file that uses the PixarLog compression is processed.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted TIFF file that will be processed by a vulnerable libtiff version."
