Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119). Specifically, it involves an ActiveX component in Siemens SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7 products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   Improper memory buffer handling in the ActiveX component.
-   Lack of proper input validation or boundary checks when processing data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Crashing the component:** An attacker can cause the affected ActiveX component to crash, leading to potential denial of service conditions for the application.
-   **Memory Leak:** An attacker could potentially leak portions of the application's memory, exposing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Social Engineering:** The attack relies on social engineering, where a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link. This link would be hosted on a website that is allowed to execute ActiveX components.
-   **Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to control or have access to a website where they can host the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to host a website:** The attacker must control a website that can execute ActiveX components.
-   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to interact with the malicious link.
-   **Knowledge of vulnerable software and its interaction with ActiveX:** Attacker needs to know the vulnerable version and how to construct a malicious link that would trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability is not directly exploitable remotely; it requires user interaction to trigger the exploit.
-   No public exploits were known at the time of this advisory.
-   Crafting a working exploit is considered difficult.

**Affected Products:**
-   SIMATIC WinCC: All versions prior to SIMATIC WinCC V7.2
-   SIMATIC PCS 7: All versions prior to SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.0 SP1
