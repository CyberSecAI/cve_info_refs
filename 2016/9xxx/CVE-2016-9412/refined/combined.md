If you’re using MyBB 1.8.6:

* Download and use the [Changed Files Package](http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/changed_files_1807.zip) (MD5: 5542aee753edfd18fc9b9e5783058d9d)

#### Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities

If you think you’ve found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we’ve had time to prepare and release a patch.

As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybb.com/contact/) page or in our [Private Inquiries](http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html) forum – where you can start a new thread that only you and the MyBB Team can see.

This release is to ensure that all users of MyBB Merge 1.8 have the latest fixes.

* inc/cachehandlers/memcache.php
* inc/cachehandlers/memcached.php

    Quick question, will MyBB eventually have a super-convenient upgrade system, like WordPress? A system where the admin can hit “UPGRADE” and the whole thing happens, in a few seconds?
