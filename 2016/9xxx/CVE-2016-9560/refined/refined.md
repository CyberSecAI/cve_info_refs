Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `jpc_tsfb_getbands2` function within the `jpc_tsfb.c` file of the JasPer library. This vulnerability occurs during the decoding of JPEG-2000 images when processing a crafted image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `bnds` array, allocated on the stack in the `jpc_tsfb_getbands2` function, is overflowed due to insufficient bounds checking when writing to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A crafted image can cause the application using JasPer to crash.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: Although not explicitly stated, the overflow could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code if an attacker can carefully control the overflowed data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Image File: A crafted JPEG-2000 image file is the primary attack vector. The application using the vulnerable JasPer library decodes this malicious file, triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted JPEG-2000 image to an application using the vulnerable JasPer library. This could be through a file upload, via a network stream, or any mechanism by which an application processes user-provided image files.
- No special system-level privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The specific location of the overflow was in jpc_tsfb.c at line 227:16 according to the ASan output.
- The affected versions are prior to 1.900.30
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit 1abc2e5a401a4bf1d5ca4df91358ce5df111f495
- The `jpc_dec_tileinit` function calls `jpc_tsfb_getbands` which in turn calls `jpc_tsfb_getbands2`
- Red Hat also identified CVE-2016-9560 as a stack-based buffer overflow in jpc_dec_tileinit().
- A PoC exists at <https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00047-jasper-stackoverflow-jpc_tsfb_getbands2>
- Other versions 1.900.26, 1.900.27, 1.900.28, 1.900.29 are also affected
