  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `t2p_process_jpeg_strip` function in `tools/tiff2pdf.c` of libtiff 4.0.6 has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in heap-allocated buffers.",

    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files or by tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool.",
    "attack_vector": "By processing a specially crafted TIFF file via a vulnerable function, the attacker can trigger the overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious crafted TIFF file, specifically crafted to trigger an out-of-bounds write in the `t2p_process_jpeg_strip` function of `tools/tiff2pdf.c`."
