  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An assertion failure can be triggered in the `jpc_dequantize` function due to a missing check or invalid input in the JPEG 2000 decoding process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reachable Assertion",
      "Incorrect Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is a denial-of-service via an application crash due to the assertion failure. This can occur when processing a malformed or specifically crafted JPEG 2000 image.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious JPEG 2000 image with specific characteristics that causes the `absstepsize` to be negative during the dequantization process."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG 2000 file to a vulnerable application using the Jasper library. No special privileges are needed.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies within the `jpc_dequantize` function, specifically with the check `absstepsize >= 0`. The supplied test case triggers this assertion due to a negative `absstepsize`, causing the process to terminate. The root cause is how the library calculates or handles the `absstepsize` under certain conditions when decoding malformed JPEG 2000 files."
