Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues within phpMyAdmin, including an improper fix for a previous XSS vulnerability (PMASA-2016-10) and a weakness in a regular expression used in JavaScript processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability type is XSS. This occurs due to inadequate sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to a range of impacts including:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (in some cases):** Although not directly stated for this specific CVE, the Gentoo Security Advisory lists Arbitrary PHP Code execution as an impact of the multiple vulnerabilities found in phpMyAdmin, implying that such an outcome might be possible.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting attacks:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of phpMyAdmin. This means the attacker would exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious requests through the web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests that exploit the XSS vulnerabilities. This would require a position where the attacker can interact with the phpMyAdmin instance, either directly or through an intermediary. No specific authentication requirements are mentioned in the context of this particular CVE, but XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited in both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios depending on the vulnerable context.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered "non-critical" by phpMyAdmin team, which might indicate that the specific exploitation scenarios are less common or impactful compared to other vulnerabilities.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201701-32) provides a broader overview of multiple vulnerabilities affecting phpMyAdmin, including CVE-2016-9857, and states that the worst of which could lead to arbitrary code execution by an authenticated remote attacker.
*   The advisory specifies that the vulnerability is "exploitable remote".
*   The affected versions are all 4.6.x versions prior to 4.6.5, 4.4.x versions prior to 4.4.15.9, and 4.0.x versions prior to 4.0.10.18.
*   Patches for the vulnerability are provided through specific commits to the 4.0, 4.4, and 4.6 branches of the phpMyAdmin project.
