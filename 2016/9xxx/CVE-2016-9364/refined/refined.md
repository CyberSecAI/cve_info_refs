- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files and directories on the server. The attacker cannot write data.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skill can exploit the vulnerability remotely. No specific privileges are required.
