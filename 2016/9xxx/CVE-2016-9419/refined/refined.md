Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the MyBB Admin Control Panel (ACP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the ACP, which will then be executed when other users access the relevant sections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the ACP, which can then be executed in the browsers of other administrators or moderators when they access the affected area.
- **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining control of an administrator's session, allowing for actions such as changing settings, manipulating data, or escalating privileges.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information such as session cookies or user details through the execution of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Control Panel (ACP):** The attacker needs to find a way to insert malicious code into an ACP input or field that is not properly sanitized or escaped.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to ACP Input:** The attacker needs to find an entry point where they can input their XSS payload into the admin control panel. This could be via a feature that allows modification of settings or content.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker requires some level of access to the MyBB ACP, potentially with lower privileged accounts with the ability to modify some ACP settings/features.
