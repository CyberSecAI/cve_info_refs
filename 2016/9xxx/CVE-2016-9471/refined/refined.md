Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9471:

**CVE-2016-9471 - Special Element Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Usernames were not properly sanitized when creating users. Specifically, control characters were not filtered. This allowed the creation of visually identical usernames, as control characters are often ignored during HTML rendering in browsers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Special Element Injection:** The core issue is the injection of special characters (control characters) into the username field.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize or validate input to remove or encode potentially problematic characters.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **User Spoofing:** An attacker could create a user with a visually identical name to an existing user by injecting control characters, potentially leading to confusion or impersonation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered during user creation within the Revive Adserver interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have elevated privileges to create users within the Revive Adserver application.
    *  The attacker needs to be able to input specific control characters in the username field when creating new users

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by Joel Noguera via HackerOne.
*   The provided commit `05b1eceb` on GitHub shows the fix for this issue, which involves adding a check `preg_match('#[\x00-\x1F\x7F]#', $this->request['login'])` to filter control characters before creating the user.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 3.1, indicating a low severity vulnerability, which reflects the fact that it requires elevated privileges to exploit and has a low impact.
