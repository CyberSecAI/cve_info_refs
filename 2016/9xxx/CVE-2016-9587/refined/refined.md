Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-9587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in Ansible's insufficient input validation when handling data (specifically "facts") sent from client systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Input Validation Failure:** Ansible does not properly sanitize or validate the data it receives from client systems before processing it. Specifically, this flaw affects how Ansible handles facts sent back from client systems.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the data sent by a client, an attacker can inject malicious code that is then executed by the Ansible server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server with the privileges of the Ansible server user. This could lead to full system compromise of the Ansible control node.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Once the Ansible controller is compromised, an attacker could gain access to all the systems managed by that controller.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** An attacker could steal sensitive information from the managed systems, modify data, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Client:** The attacker needs to compromise a client system that is being managed by Ansible.
*   **Data Injection:** The attacker, having control of the compromised client, must have the ability to send malicious "facts" back to the Ansible server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Client System:** An attacker needs to gain control of a client system that is managed by Ansible.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Ansible server to send the malicious facts.
*   **Understanding of Ansible's Data Handling:** The attacker needs to understand how Ansible processes facts, including what data is sent back by clients and how Ansible handles that data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) address this CVE, meaning it affected various Red Hat products like Red Hat OpenStack Platform, Red Hat Gluster Storage, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Storage Console, and RHEV Engine.
*   The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix from a prior vulnerability.
*   The fix includes updating the `ansible` package to versions 2.1.4, 2.2.1 and 2.3.0.0.
