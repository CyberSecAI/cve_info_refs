Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-9084:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `vfio_pci_intrs.c` file when using `kzalloc`.
- Specifically, the size argument to `kzalloc` which involves integer multiplication, wasn't validated, leading to the overflow.
- This issue was present in the VFIO (Virtual Function I/O) driver for PCI devices in the Linux kernel.
- This vulnerability is linked to another vulnerability, CVE-2016-9083, which is a "state machine confusion bug" in the same VFIO driver.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:**  The core weakness is the lack of proper checks on the result of an integer multiplication used as a size argument to `kzalloc`.
- **Memory Corruption:** Integer overflow can lead to a smaller than expected memory allocation which later causes the program to write data outside of the allocated memory region. This could result in memory corruption.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl, when used with specific flags, bypasses integer overflow checks and the range check of hdr.start/hdr.count.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** An attacker could cause memory corruption due to the integer overflow.
- **Kernel Subversion:** By corrupting memory, the attacker could potentially overwrite kernel memory and gain control over system execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The memory corruption could lead to a system crash, resulting in a denial of service. The provided notes do state that "This combined with CVE-2016-9083 may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially crashing the machine."
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the primary impact was memory corruption, the Red Hat Security Advisory notes that a local user with the right capabilities (CAP\_NET\_RAW) combined with CVE-2016-9083 could use this to elevate their privileges.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack Vector:** The vulnerability requires a local user to access a suitable vfio device file and issue a specific `ioctl` to trigger the vulnerable code.
- **VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS Ioctl:** The `VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS` ioctl is the attack vector, specifically by using the `VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE` flag with another bit in the `VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK` flag.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Privileges/Capabilities:** The attacker needs access to an appropriate vfio device file and the ability to issue `ioctl` calls. Red Hat documentation mentions CAP\_NET\_RAW as a required capability for local privilege escalation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "low-severity" in the original report by Vlad Tsyrklevich, mainly because it is hard to exploit.
- Red Hat rated this as a "Moderate" security impact issue.
- A patch was created which introduces checks to prevent integer overflows during size calculation and enforces correct usage of the `VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_TYPE_MASK` bitmask by ensuring that only single element is set. The patch also changes `kzalloc` to `kcalloc`, which has a built-in check for integer overflows.
- The fix for this vulnerability is part of the Red Hat Security Advisories RHSA-2017:0386 and RHSA-2017:0387.
