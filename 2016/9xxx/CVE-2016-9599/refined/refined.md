Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-9599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in `puppet-tripleo`'s IPtables rules management. This flaw allows the creation of TCP/UDP rules with empty port values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure IPtables rules:** The core issue is that `puppet-tripleo` allows the creation of IPtables rules without a port specified, specifically when SSL is enabled and the `$public_ssl_port` variable is empty for some services.
*   **Lack of access control:** This results in allowing all traffic on the TCP protocol when it should have been limited to a specific port.
*   **Empty port values:** Some API services in Red Hat OpenStack Platform director, which are not meant to be exposed to public networks, have an empty `$public_ssl_port` value (e.g., `openstack-glance`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access:** A malicious user could exploit these open ports to gain access to unauthorized resources. This could potentially lead to compromise of the system and/or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker could leverage the overly permissive IPtables rules to send traffic to vulnerable services.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability allows for remote exploitation if the affected services are reachable on the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the exposed services.
*   The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the empty port vulnerability
*   The attacker must be in a network position to access services affected by the overly permissive firewall rules.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to how `puppet-tripleo` handles the configuration of IPtables rules.
*   The affected services, such as `openstack-glance`, are deployed by default on both undercloud and overcloud environments.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when SSL is enabled.
*   The created IPtables rules, when vulnerable, look like this: `-A INPUT -p tcp -m comment --comment "100 glance_registry_haproxy_ssl" -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT` (note the missing port).

**Affected Products/Versions**

* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)
* `puppet-tripleo` versions prior to 5.5.0 and 6.2.0

**Mitigation:**
*  The vulnerability is resolved by updating `puppet-tripleo` to version 5.5.0 or 6.2.0
