Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `QBE.EQ.REF_NUM` parameter of the CA Service Desk Manager (SDM) web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameter.
- If a user clicks on a specially crafted link containing the malicious script, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
- This could lead to various consequences, such as session hijacking, data theft, or malware installation on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into clicking a malicious link, or visiting a specially crafted URL.
- This link contains the malicious script within the `QBE.EQ.REF_NUM` parameter, which is then reflected back on the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the link to the victim and convince the victim to click the link.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the target system or application, as the vulnerability is exploited through the user's web browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects CA Service Desk Manager versions 12.9 and 14.1.
- The vulnerability is rated as Medium risk by CA Technologies.
- A solution is available and detailed in KB article TEC1774903.
