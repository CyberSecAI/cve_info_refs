- **Root cause of vulnerability**: HTTP Parameter Override. The application exposes duplicated parameters, which can lead to anomalous behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an HTTP Parameter Override. This means that the application does not properly handle duplicate parameters, potentially leading to unexpected behavior based on how the parameters are processed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause anomalous behavior within the application. While the CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and availability, the impact on integrity is low, and it has the potential to cause some degree of negative impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access and must be a low-privileged user. They must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application with manipulated parameters.
