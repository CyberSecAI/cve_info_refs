Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-9208:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP POST parameters. Specifically, filenames provided by users are not properly checked and sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. Attackers can use directory traversal techniques (e.g., "../") in filenames to access files outside of the intended directory. This is achieved through the File Management Utility, the Download File form, and the Serviceability application of Cisco Emergency Responder.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The system fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious path traversal sequences to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** A successful exploit allows an authenticated, remote attacker to read files located anywhere on the affected device's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- **Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **HTTP POST Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating HTTP POST parameters that are used to specify filenames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco Emergency Responder device.
- The attacker must have valid authentication credentials for the affected system.
- The attacker has to craft malicious HTTP POST requests containing directory traversal sequences.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing by Cisco.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Emergency Responder.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.0 (base) and 3.3 (temporal)
- The CWE is CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)
