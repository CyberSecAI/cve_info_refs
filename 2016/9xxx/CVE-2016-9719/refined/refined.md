Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-9719

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of the `X-Frame-Options` header in the HTTP response of IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management. This header is used to prevent clickjacking attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing `X-Frame-Options` header, making the application vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can hijack the victim's click actions.
- This can potentially lead to further attacks against the victim by tricking them into performing actions they did not intend.
- An attacker could potentially trick a user into performing actions such as changing passwords or transferring funds.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is launched through a malicious website.
- The attacker persuades the victim to visit the malicious website.
- The malicious website then loads the vulnerable application in an iframe and overlays it with deceptive content, tricking the victim into performing actions on the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to persuade a victim to visit the malicious website.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable application or the victim's machine, this is a remote attack.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management versions 10.1, 11.0, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN`. This prevents the application from being loaded in an iframe from a different origin.
- IBM provides specific fixes for different versions of the product as well as manual fix instructions.
