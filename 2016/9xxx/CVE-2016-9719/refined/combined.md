For Busines Admin UI the issue can be resolved by applying the fix manually. If the UI has been customized and the source code is already available skip step #1 and #2.

1. Locate the com.ibm.mdm.sample.ba.webapp.ear.zip file from MDM sample.

2. Import the projects into RAD and follow [Downloading, configuring and deploying the sample](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWSR9_11.5.0/com.ibm.mdmhs.dat.stdshp.doc/t_download_configure_ear.html)

3. Open **SessionFilter.java** from CommonUIModel

- In **doFilter** method add the below code provided code at line number 75

//PSIRT 88737 - X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.

httpResponse.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "SAMEORIGIN");

- After the code changes do build all

4. Export CustomerBusinessAdmin as EAR

Then From RAD, File -> Export -> Ear File (Under Java EE)

in EAR Export wizard

- select EAR Project name as 'CustomerBusinessAdmin'

- Then provide the destination , that earfile name

5. Deploy the this new exported EAR on server

**Note:** Before installing EAR on server make sure ClientAuthentication.properties and mdmUIConfiguration.properties of propertiesUI.jar have valid connection properties.
