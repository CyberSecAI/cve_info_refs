Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the *Decrypt for End-User Notification* configuration parameter of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliances (WSA). This setting, when enabled with HTTPS decryption and configured to block connections to certain websites, incorrectly allows connections to those websites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Policy Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a policy bypass. The WSA fails to enforce its configured block on connections to specific websites when HTTPS decryption is enabled and the 'Decrypt for End-User Notification' option is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass the WSA's intended block on connections to specific secure websites.
*   This allows an attacker to connect to sites that should have been blocked.
*   The vulnerability does not provide confidentiality or integrity impact. 
*   Impact is limited to bypassing configured access controls, which may lead to unauthorized access of blocked web sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate with the WSA, nor do they need to be on the same network.
*   **Network-based:** The attack involves network connections to the target via the WSA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable WSA over the network.
*   The attacker needs to target websites that are configured to be blocked.
*   No special privileges or credentials are required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is identified by the CVE ID CVE-2016-9212 and is classified as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
*   The CVSS score is Base 4.3, Temporal 4.1. The vector string is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C which indicates that the attack is network based with medium access complexity, no authentication required with partial confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and no availability impact. Exploitability is functional, remediation level is unavailable and the report confidence is confirmed.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
*   There are no known public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
* No workarounds are available.
