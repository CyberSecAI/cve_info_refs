Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9935:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an invalid read in the `php_wddx_pop_element` function within the `ext/wddx/wddx.c` file of PHP. This function is responsible for handling the deserialization of WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange) packets, specifically when processing an empty boolean element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Invalid Read:** The code attempts to access memory based on a pointer obtained from the WDDX stack, but this pointer can be invalid when an empty boolean element `<boolean/>` is encountered during deserialization. This can lead to reading from an arbitrary memory location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The invalid memory read can cause the application to crash, specifically through a segmentation fault, making the service unavailable.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Memory Read:** While not directly exploited, the vulnerability technically involves reading memory from an invalid location. This could potentially lead to other impacts, although the provided information focuses on DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker sending a specially crafted WDDX packet via the network. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered during WDDX packet deserialization in php which is often used for inter-process communication over network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be a remote entity sending malicious data to a vulnerable PHP application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Control Over Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input data processed by the vulnerable PHP code which uses `wddx_deserialize()`.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a WDDX document which contains an empty boolean element.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PHP versions before 5.6.29 and 7.x before 7.0.14.
- The fix involves adding a check for null 'atts' before pushing to the WDDX stack and processing a boolean tag.
- A test case (`CVE-2016-9935.php`) is provided to reproduce the crash.
- The fix was implemented by the following commit: <https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/66fd44209d5ffcb9b3d1bc1b9fd8e35b485040c0>
