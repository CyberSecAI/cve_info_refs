- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager, allowing the embedding of arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to alteration of intended functionality and potentially to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web user interface of the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to embed malicious JavaScript code into the application's web UI. The attacker would need to be a low privileged user with access to the vulnerable web application.
