Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WebKit's JavaScriptCore, specifically within the `WTF::(anonymous namespace)::lockHashtable()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: This occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by parsing a specially crafted Javascript file with a vulnerable version of JavaScriptCore.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JavaScript file to be parsed by the vulnerable WebKitGTK+ component. This could be achieved by getting a user to visit a malicious website or through another attack vector that leads to processing of such a file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in the WebKit bug tracker and was not initially acknowledged promptly.
- The issue is present in WebKitGTK+ versions prior to 2.16.3.
- Google Chrome/Chromium is noted to be unaffected.
- The provided stack trace suggests that the overflow occurs during a locking operation of a hashtable, within the `WTF` library.
