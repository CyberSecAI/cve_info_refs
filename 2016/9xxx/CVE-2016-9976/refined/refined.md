- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in URL requests. Specifically, a crafted URL can lead to arbitrary file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file inclusion flaw, where a remote attacker can include arbitrary files via a specially crafted URL. This may also lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through specially crafted URL requests sent to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker needs to have network access to the application, although no authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability (PR:L in CVSS vector means low privileges but could refer to no privileges in this context).
