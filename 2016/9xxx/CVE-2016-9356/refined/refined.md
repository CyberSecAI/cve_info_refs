Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-9356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **unquoted search path or element** within the Moxa DACenter application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Search Path (CWE-428):** The application is vulnerable to an unquoted search path issue. This means that if the application searches for a program or DLL using a path that isn't enclosed in quotes, an attacker can insert a malicious executable with the same name into a directory that is checked by the search path prior to the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authorized but non-privileged local user can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system. However, this access can be that of a standard, unprivileged user.
*   **Malicious Executable:** The attacker could place a malicious file in a directory earlier in the search path than the legitimate files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to log in to the system with a local account (even a non-privileged one).
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write files to the file system in locations that the application's search path will check.
