tell, this "second flic bug" exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2016-9635.)

flxdec: rewrite logic based on GstByteReader/WriterSolves overreading/writing the given arrays and will error out if the
streams asks to do that.
Also does more error checking that the stream is valid and won't
overrun any allocated arrays. Also mitigate integer overflow errors
calculating allocation sizes.

### [0day] [PoC] Incorrect fix for gstreamer FLIC decoder vulnerability CESA-2016-0004

Overview
Recently (Nov 21st, 2016), I published an 0day exploit against the gstreamer FLIC decoder, [here on my blog](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2016/11/0day-exploit-advancing-exploitation.html).

The response time from gstreamer upstream was impressive: a patch in 1 day or so that fixed not only the immediate issue but also some similar bugs in other functions in the decoder. More on those other bugs in another post. Here is the [git commit](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good/commit/?id=bf43f44fcfada5ec4a3ce60cb374340486fe9fac).

The response from Ubuntu, one of the distributions I use, was also fast. On Nov 22nd 2016, they published a gstreamer advisory: [USN-3135-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3135-1/). At the time of writing -- Nov 24th, 2016 -- I am not being offered patches for my Fedora 24 or Fedora 25 installs, by way of contrast.

Unfortunately, the fix was not 100% correct. Presented here is an 0day PoC (PoC, not exploit!) for the remaining memory corruption issue, along with a description of the code error.

The remaining vulnerability
Bounds checks were added for all three of the failure conditions I noted in my original blog post. The new code inside flx\_decode\_delta\_fli() looks like this:

...
  start\_line = (data[0] + (data[1] << 8));
  lines = (data[2] + (data[3] << 8));
  if (start\_line + lines > flxdec->hdr.height) {
    GST\_ERROR\_OBJECT (flxdec, "Invalid FLI packet detected. too many lines.");
    return FALSE;
  }
  data += 4;

  /\* start position of delta \*/
  dest += (flxdec->hdr.width \* start\_line);
  start\_p = dest;

  while (lines--) {
    /\* packet count \*/
    packets = \*data++;

    while (packets--) {
      /\* skip count \*/
      guchar skip = \*data++;
      dest += skip;

      /\* RLE count \*/
      count = \*data++;

      if (count > 0x7f) {
        /\* literal run \*/
        count = 0x100 - count;

        if (skip + count > flxdec->hdr.width) {
          GST\_ERROR\_OBJECT (flxdec, "Invalid FLI packet detected. "
              "line too long.");
          return FALSE;
        }

        x = \*data++;
        while (count--)
          \*dest++ = x;
…

There’s an attempt to make sure that the skip pixel count plus the number of pixels to write stays within the bounds of the canvas width. But there’s subtle problem: the format permits multiple skip and count pairs per canvas line. And the skip counts are considered individually rather than cumulatively. Therefore, it’s possible to get the skip + count check to pass while still writing off the end of the line. If we arrange to write off the end of the last line, we have a memory corruption.

Building a PoC
Building a PoC is not too complicated. We allocate a canvas buffer of dimensions 255 x 1. By having only one line, we ensure that any write off the end of the line will be a write off the end of the last line and therefore a memory corruption.

And then the main line of bytes inside the PoC file is:
10 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00 01 00 02 FF 00 00 80 41

This is a chunk of size 16 (10 00 00 00), type FLX\_LC (0C 00). We start writing at line offset 0 (00 00) for 1 line (01 00). We write 2 packets of skip / count pairs (02). The first packet skips 255 bytes along the line, and writes 0 pixels (FF 00). This stays within bounds for the checks. The second packet skips 0 bytes further along (00) and writes 128 bytes (80) of value ‘A’ (41). The second packet passes the check because 0 + 128 is less than the width of 255. But that check didn’t take into account the fact that our first packet skipped 255 bytes along the line. So an out of bounds write results.

In the debugger:
gdb gst-play-1.0
(gdb) r crash\_delta\_fli\_2.flx
Thread 2 "typefind:sink" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 0x7ffff49f3700 (LWP 9257)]
\_int\_malloc (av=av@entry=0x7ffff0000020, bytes=bytes@entry=32) at malloc.c:3725
(gdb) disass $rip,$rip+10
Dump of assembler code from 0x7ffff6389c4e to 0x7ffff6389c58:

(gdb) p/x $r15
$1 = 0x4141414141414141

That looks like heap metadata corruption -- not good. This vulnerability offers similar power to the original one, but with less “range” in terms of how far forward into the heap it is possible to corrupt. Still, it would be foolish to propose this isn’t exploitable.

You can refer to this new vulnerability as CESA-2016-0011. The original cluster of issues was CESA-2016-0004.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

The latest bug-fix release in the 1.10 series is [1.10.5](#1.10.5) and was released on 15 June 2017.  The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new major feature release in the stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!  As always, this release is again packed with new features, bug fixes and other improvements.  See <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.10/> for the latest version of this document.  *Last updated: Thursday 15 Jun 2017, 09:30 UTC [(log)](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/www/log/src/htdocs/releases/1.10/release-notes-1.10.md)* Introduction The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new major feature release in the stable 1.x API series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!  As always, this release is again packed with new features, bug fixes and other improvements. Highlights  * Several convenience APIs have been added to make developers' lives easier * A new `GstStream` API provides applications a more meaningful view of the   structure of streams, simplifying the process of dealing with media in   complex container formats * Experimental `decodebin3` and `playbin3` elements which bring a number of   improvements which were hard to implement within `decodebin` and `playbin` * A new `parsebin` element to automatically unpack and parse a stream, stopping   just short of decoding * Experimental new `meson`-based build system, bringing faster build and much   better Windows support (including for building with Visual Studio) * A new `gst-docs` module has been created, and we are in the process of moving   our documentation to a markdown-based format for easier maintenance and   updates * A new `gst-examples` module has been created, which contains example   GStreamer applications and is expected to grow with many more examples in   the future * Various OpenGL and OpenGL|ES-related fixes and improvements for greater   efficiency on desktop and mobile platforms, and Vulkan support on Wayland was   also added * Extensive improvements to the VAAPI plugins for improved robustness and   efficiency * Lots of fixes and improvements across the board, spanning RTP/RTSP, V4L2,   Bluetooth, audio conversion, echo cancellation, and more!  Major new features and changesNoteworthy new API, features and other changesCore API additionsReceive property change notifications via bus messages New API was added to receive element property change notifications via bus messages. So far, applications had to connect a callback to an element's `notify::property-name` signal via the GObject API, which was inconvenient for at least two reasons: one had to implement a signal callback function, and that callback function would usually be called from one of the streaming threads, so one had to marshal (send) any information gathered or pending requests to the main application thread which was tedious and error-prone.  Enter [`gst_element_add_property_notify_watch()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-add-property-notify-watch) and [`gst_element_add_property_deep_notify_watch()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-add-property-deep-notify-watch) which will watch for changes of a property on the specified element, either only for this element or recursively for a whole bin or pipeline. Whenever such a property change happens, a `GST_MESSAGE_PROPERTY_NOTIFY` message will be posted on the pipeline bus with details of the element, the property and the new property value, all of which can be retrieved later from the message in the application via [`gst_message_parse_property_notify()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-parse-property-notify). Unlike the GstBus watch functions, this API does not rely on a running GLib main loop.  The above can be used to be notified asynchronously of caps changes in the pipeline, or volume changes on an audio sink element, for example. GstBin "deep" element-added and element-removed signals GstBin has gained `"deep-element-added"` and `"deep-element-removed"` signals which makes it easier for applications and higher-level plugins to track when elements are added or removed from a complex pipeline with multiple sub-bins.  `playbin` makes use of this to implement the new `"element-setup"` signal which can be used to configure elements as they are added to `playbin`, just like the existing `"source-setup"` signal which can be used to configure the source element created. Error messages can contain additional structured details It is often useful to provide additional, structured information in error, warning or info messages for applications (or higher-level elements) to make intelligent decisions based on them. To allow this, error, warning and info messages now have API for adding arbitrary additional information to them using a `GstStructure`: [`GST_ELEMENT_ERROR_WITH_DETAILS`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#GST-ELEMENT-ERROR-WITH-DETAILS:CAPS) and corresponding API for the other message types.  This is now used e.g. by the new [`GST_ELEMENT_FLOW_ERROR`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#GST-ELEMENT-FLOW-ERROR:CAPS) API to include the actual flow error in the error message, and the [souphttpsrc element](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good/tree/ext/soup/gstsouphttpsrc.c?id=60d30db912a1aedd743e66b9dcd2e21d71fbb24f#n1318) to provide the HTTP status code, and the URL (if any) to which a redirection has happened. Redirect messages have official API now Sometimes, elements need to redirect the current stream URL and tell the application to proceed with this new URL, possibly using a different protocol too (thus changing the pipeline configuration). Until now, this was informally implemented using `ELEMENT` messages on the bus.  Now this has been formalized in the form of a new `GST_MESSAGE_REDIRECT` message. A new redirect message can be created using [`gst_message_new_redirect()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-new-redirect). If needed, multiple redirect locations can be specified by calling [`gst_message_add_redirect_entry()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-add-redirect-entry) to add further redirect entries, all with metadata, so the application can decide which is most suitable (e.g. depending on the bitrate tags). New pad linking convenience functions that automatically create ghost pads New pad linking convenience functions were added: [`gst_pad_link_maybe_ghosting()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-link-maybe-ghosting) and [`gst_pad_link_maybe_ghosting_full()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-link-maybe-ghosting-full) which were previously internal to GStreamer have now been exposed for general use.  The existing pad link functions will refuse to link pads or elements at different levels in the pipeline hierarchy, requiring the developer to create ghost pads where necessary. These new utility functions will automatically create ghostpads as needed when linking pads at different levels of the hierarchy (e.g. from an element inside a bin to one that's at the same level in the hierarchy as the bin, or in another bin). Miscellaneous Pad probes: IDLE and BLOCK probes now work slightly differently in pull mode, so that push and pull mode have opposite scenarios for idle and blocking probes. In push mode, it will block with some data type and IDLE won't have any data. In pull mode, it will block *before* getting a buffer and will be IDLE once some data has been obtained. ([commit](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/commit/gst/gstpad.c?id=368ee8a336d0c868d81fdace54b24431a8b48cbf), [bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761211))  [`gst_parse_launch_full()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstParse.html#gst-parse-launch-full) can now be made to return a `GstBin` instead of a top-level pipeline by passing the new `GST_PARSE_FLAG_PLACE_IN_BIN` flag.  The default GStreamer debug log handler can now be removed before calling `gst_init()`, so that it will never get installed and won't be active during initialization.  A new [`STREAM_GROUP_DONE` event](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-stream-group-done) was added. In some ways it works similar to the `EOS` event in that it can be used to unblock downstream elements which may be waiting for further data, such as for example `input-selector`. Unlike `EOS`, further data flow may happen after the `STREAM_GROUP_DONE` event though (and without the need to flush the pipeline). This is used to unblock input-selector when switching between streams in adaptive streaming scenarios (e.g. HLS).  The `gst-launch-1.0` command line tool will now print unescaped caps in verbose mode (enabled by the -v switch).  [`gst_element_call_async()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstElement.html#gst-element-call-async) has been added as convenience API for plugin developers. It is useful for one-shot operations that need to be done from a thread other than the current streaming thread. It is backed by a thread-pool that is shared by all elements.  Various race conditions have been fixed around the `GstPoll` API used by e.g. `GstBus` and `GstBufferPool`. Some of these manifested themselves primarily on Windows.  `GstAdapter` can now keep track of discontinuities signalled via the `DISCONT` buffer flag, and has gained [new API](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-libs/html/GstAdapter.html#gst-adapter-pts-at-discont) to track PTS, DTS and offset at the last discont. This is useful for plugins implementing advanced trick mode scenarios.  `GstTestClock` gained a new [`"clock-type"` property](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-libs/html/GstTestClock.html#GstTestClock--clock-type). GstStream API for stream announcement and stream selection New stream listing and stream selection API: new API has been added to provide high-level abstractions for streams ([`GstStream`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStream.html)) and collections of streams ([`GstStreamCollections`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStreamCollection.html)). Stream listing A [`GstStream`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStream.html) contains all the information pertinent to a stream, such as stream id, caps, tags, flags and stream type(s); it can represent a single elementary stream (e.g. audio, video, subtitles, etc.) or a container stream. This will depend on the context. In a decodebin3/playbin3 one it will typically be elementary streams that can be selected and unselected.  A [`GstStreamCollection`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/gstreamer-GstStreamCollection.html) represents a group of streams and is used to announce or publish all available streams. A GstStreamCollection is immutable - once created it won't change. If the available streams change, e.g. because a new stream appeared or some streams disappeared, a new stream collection will be published. This new stream collection may contain streams from the previous collection if those streams persist, or completely new ones. Stream collections do not yet list all theoretically available streams, e.g. other available DVD angles or alternative resolutions/bitrate of the same stream in case of adaptive streaming.  New events and messages have been added to notify or update other elements and the application about which streams are currently available and/or selected. This way, we can easily and seamlessly let the application know whenever the available streams change, as happens frequently with digital television streams for example. The new system is also more flexible. For example, it is now also possible for the application to select multiple streams of the same type (e.g. in a transcoding/transmuxing scenario).  A [`STREAM_COLLECTION` message](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstMessage.html#gst-message-new-stream-collection) is posted on the bus to inform the parent bin (e.g. `playbin3`, `decodebin3`) and/or the application about what streams are available, so you no longer have to hunt for this information at different places. The available information includes number of streams of each type, caps, tags etc. Bins and/or the application can intercept the message synchronously to select and deselect streams before any data is produced - for the case where elements such as the demuxers support the new stream API, not necessarily in the parsebin compatibility fallback case.  Similarly, there is also a [`STREAM_COLLECTION` event](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-stream-collection) to inform downstream elements of the available streams. This event can be used by elements to aggregate streams from multiple inputs into one single collection.  The `STREAM_START` event was extended so that it can also contain a GstStream object with all information about the current stream, see [`gst_event_set_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-set-stream) and [`gst_event_parse_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-parse-stream). [`gst_pad_get_stream()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstPad.html#gst-pad-get-stream) is a new utility function that can be used to look up the GstStream from the `STREAM_START` sticky event on a pad. Stream selection Once the available streams have been published, streams can be selected via their stream ID using the new `SELECT_STREAMS` event, which can be created with [`gst_event_new_select_streams()`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-select-streams). The new API supports selecting multiple streams per stream type. In the future, we may also implement explicit deselection of streams that will never be used, so elements can skip these and never expose them or output data for them in the first place.  The application is then notified of the currently selected streams via the new `STREAMS_SELECTED` message on the pipeline bus, containing both the current stream collection as well as the selected streams. This might be posted in response to the application sending a `SELECT_STREAMS` event or when `decodebin3` or `playbin3` decide on the streams to be initially selected without application input. Further reading See further below for some notes on the new elements supporting this new stream API, namely: `decodebin3`, `playbin3` and `parsebin`.

Integrating the resampler with the other audio conversion library allows us to implement generic conversion much more efficiently, as format conversion and resampling can now be done in the same processing loop instead of having to do it in separate steps (our element implementations do not make use of this yet though).  The new audio resampler library is a combination of some of the best features of other samplers such as ffmpeg, speex and SRC. It natively supports S16, S32, F32 and F64 formats and uses optimized x86 and neon assembly for most of its processing. It also has support for dynamically changing sample rates by incrementally updating the filter tables using linear or cubic interpolation. According to some benchmarks, it's one of the fastest and most accurate resamplers around.  The `audioresample` plugin has been ported to the new audio library functions to make use of the new resampler. Support for SMPTE timecodes Support for SMPTE timecodes was added to the GStreamer video library. This comes with an abstraction for timecodes, [`GstVideoTimeCode`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-gstvideo.html#GstVideoTimeCode) and a [`GstMeta`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-gstvideometa.html#gst-buffer-add-video-time-code-meta) that can be placed on video buffers for carrying the timecode information for each frame. Additionally there is various API for making handling of timecodes easy and to do various calculations with them.  A new plugin called [`timecode`](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/tree/gst/timecode) was added, that contains an element called `timecodestamper` for putting the timecode meta on video frames based on counting the frames and another element called `timecodewait` that drops all video (and audio) until a specific timecode is reached.  Additionally support was added to the Decklink plugin for including the timecode information when sending video out or capturing it via SDI, the `qtmux` element is able to write timecode information into the MOV container, and the `timeoverlay` element can overlay timecodes on top of the video.  More information can be found in the [talk about timecodes](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/smpte-timecodes-in-gstreamer/) at the GStreamer Conference 2016. GStreamer OpenMAX IL plugin The last gst-omx release, 1.2.0, was in July 2014. It was about time to get a new one out with all the improvements that have happened in the meantime. From now on, we will try to release gst-omx together with all other modules.  This release features a lot of bugfixes, improved support for the Raspberry Pi and in general improved support for zerocopy rendering via EGL and a few minor new features.  At this point, gst-omx is known to work best on the Raspberry Pi platform but it is also known to work on various other platforms. Unfortunately, we are not including configurations for any other platforms, so if you happen to use gst-omx: please send us patches with your configuration and code changes! New Elementsdecodebin3, playbin3, parsebin (experimental) This release features new decoding and playback elements as experimental technology previews: `decodebin3` and `playbin3` will soon supersede the existing `decodebin` and `playbin` elements. We skipped the number 2 because it was already used back in the 0.10 days, which might cause confusion. Experimental technology preview means that everything should work fine already, but we can't guarantee there won't be minor behavioural changes in the next cycle. In any case, please test and report any problems back.  Before we go into detail about what these new elements improve, let's look at the new [`parsebin`](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-parsebin.html) element. It works similarly to `decodebin` and `decodebin3`, only that it stops one step short and does not plug any actual decoder elements. It will only plug parsers, tag readers, demuxers and depayloaders. Also note that parsebin does not contain any queueing element.  [`decodebin3`'s](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-decodebin3.html) internal architecture is slightly different from the existing `decodebin` element and fixes many long-standing issues with our decoding engine. For one, data is now fed into the internal `multiqueue` element *after* it has been parsed and timestamped, which means that the `multiqueue` element now has more knowledge and is able to calculate the interleaving of the various streams, thus minimizing memory requirements and doing away with magic values for buffering limits that were conceived when videos were 240p or 360p. Anyone who has tried to play back 4k video streams with decodebin2 will have noticed the limitations of that approach. The improved timestamp tracking also enables `multiqueue` to keep streams of the same type (audio, video) aligned better, making sure switching between streams of the same type is very fast.  Another major improvement in `decodebin3` is that it will no longer decode streams that are not being used. With the old `decodebin` and `playbin`, when there were 8 audio streams we would always decode all 8 streams even if 7 were not actually used. This caused a lot of CPU overhead, which was particularly problematic on embedded devices. When switching between streams `decodebin3` will try hard to re-use existing decoders. This is useful when switching between multiple streams of the same type if they are encoded in the same format.  Re-using decoders is also useful when the available streams change on the fly, as might happen with radio streams (chained Oggs), digital television broadcasts, when adaptive streaming streams change bitrate, or when switching gaplessly to the next title. In order to guarantee a seamless transition, the old `decodebin2` would plug a second decoder for the new stream while finishing up the old stream. With `decodebin3`, this is no longer needed - at least not when the new and old format are the same. This will be particularly useful on embedded systems where it is often not possible to run multiple decoders at the same time, or when tearing down and setting up decoders is fairly expensive.  `decodebin3` also allows for multiple input streams, not just a single one. This will be useful, in the future, for gapless playback, or for feeding multiple external subtitle streams to decodebin/playbin.  `playbin3` uses `decodebin3` internally, and will supercede `playbin`. It was decided that it would be too risky to make the old `playbin` use the new `decodebin3` in a backwards-compatible way. The new architecture makes it awkward, if not impossible, to maintain perfect backwards compatibility in some aspects, hence `playbin3` was born, and developers can migrate to the new element and new API at their own pace.  All of these new elements make use of the new `GstStream` API for listing and selecting streams, as described above. `parsebin` provides backwards compatibility for demuxers and parsers which do not advertise their streams using the new API yet (which is most).  The new elements are not entirely feature-complete yet: `playbin3` does not support so-called decodersinks yet where the data is not decoded inside GStreamer but passed directly for decoding to the sink. `decodebin3` is missing the various `autoplug-*` signals to influence which decoders get autoplugged in which order. We're looking to add back this functionality, but it will probably be in a different way, with a single unified signal and using GstStream perhaps.  For more information on these new elements, check out Edward Hervey's talk [*decodebin3 - dealing with modern playback use cases*](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/decodebin3-or-dealing-with-modern-playback-use-cases/) LV2 ported from 0.10 and switched from slv2 to lilv2 The LV2 wrapper plugin has been ported to 1.0 and moved from using the deprecated slv2 library to its replacement liblv2. We support sources and filter elements. lv2 is short for *Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) version 2* and is an open standard for audio plugins which includes support for audio synthesis (generation), digital signal processing of digital audio, and MIDI. The new lv2 plugin supersedes the existing LADSPA plugin. WebRTC DSP Plugin for echo-cancellation, gain control and noise suppression A set of new elements ([webrtcdsp](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad-plugins/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-webrtcdsp.html), [webrtcechoprobe](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-bad-plugins/html/gst-plugins-bad-plugins-webrtcechoprobe.html)) based on the WebRTC DSP software stack can now be used to improve your audio voice communication pipelines. They support echo cancellation, gain control, noise suppression and more. For more details you may read [Nicolas' blog post](https://ndufresne.ca/2016/06/gstreamer-echo-canceller/). Fraunhofer FDK AAC encoder and decoder New encoder and decoder elements wrapping the Fraunhofer FDK AAC library have been added (`fdkaacdec`, `fdkaacdec`). The Fraunhofer FDK AAC encoder is generally considered to be a very high-quality AAC encoder, but unfortunately it comes under a non-free license with the option to obtain a paid, commercial license. Noteworthy element features and additionsMajor RTP and RTSP improvements  * The RTSP server and source element, as well as the RTP jitterbuffer now support   remote clock synchronization according to [RFC7273][https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7273]. * Support for application and profile specific RTCP packets was added. * The H265/HEVC payloader/depayloader is again in sync with the final RFC. * Seeking stability of the RTSP source and server was improved a lot and   runs stably now, even when doing scrub-seeking. * The RTSP server received various major bugfixes, including for regressions that   caused the IP/port address pool to not be considered, or NAT hole punching   to not work anymore. [Bugzilla #766612][https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=766612] * Various other bugfixes that improve the stability of RTP and RTSP, including   many new unit / integration tests.  Improvements to splitmuxsrc and splitmuxsink  * The splitmux element received reliability and error handling improvements,   removing at least one deadlock case. `splitmuxsrc` now stops cleanly at the end   of the segment when handling seeks with a stop time. We fixed a bug with large   amounts of downstream buffering causing incorrect out-of-sequence playback. * `splitmuxsrc` now has a `"format-location"` signal to directly specify the list   of files to play from. * `splitmuxsink` can now optionally send force-keyunit events to upstream   elements to allow splitting files more accurately instead of having to wait   for upstream to provide a new keyframe by itself.  OpenGL/GLES improvementsiOS and macOS (OS/X)  * We now create OpenGL|ES 3.x contexts on iOS by default with a fallback to   OpenGL|ES 2.x if that fails. * Various zerocopy decoding fixes and enhancements with the   encoding/decoding/capturing elements. * libdispatch is now used on all Apple platforms instead of GMainLoop, removing   the expensive poll()/pthread\_\*() overhead.  New API  * `GstGLFramebuffer` - for wrapping OpenGL frame buffer objects. It provides   facilities for attaching `GstGLMemory` objects to the necessary attachment   points, binding and unbinding and running a user-supplied function with the   framebuffer bound. * `GstGLRenderbuffer` (a `GstGLBaseMemory` subclass) - for wrapping OpenGL   render buffer objects that are typically used for depth/stencil buffers or   for color buffers where we don't care about the output. * `GstGLMemoryEGL` (a `GstGLMemory` subclass) - for combining `EGLImage`s with a GL   texture that replaces `GstEGLImageMemory` bringing the improvements made to the   other `GstGLMemory` implementations. This fixes a performance regression in   zerocopy decoding on the Raspberry Pi when used with an updated gst-omx.  Miscellaneous improvements  * `gltestsrc` is now usable on devices/platforms with OpenGL 3.x and OpenGL|ES   and has completed or gained support for new patterns in line with the   existing ones in `videotestsrc`. * `gldeinterlace` is now available on devices/platforms with OpenGL|ES   implementations. * The dispmanx backend (used on the Raspberry Pi) now supports the   `gst_video_overlay_set_window_handle()` and   `gst_video_overlay_set_render_rectangle()` functions. * The `gltransformation` element now correctly transforms mouse coordinates (in   window space) to stream coordinates for both perspective and orthographic   projections. * The `gltransformation` element now detects if the   `GstVideoAffineTransformationMeta` is supported downstream and will efficiently   pass its transformation downstream. This is a performance improvement as it   results in less processing being required. * The wayland implementation now uses the multi-threaded safe event-loop API   allowing correct usage in applications that call wayland functions from   multiple threads. * Support for native 90 degree rotations and horizontal/vertical flips   in `glimagesink`.  Vulkan  * The Vulkan elements now work under Wayland and have received numerous   bugfixes.  QML elements  * `qmlglsink` video sink now works on more platforms, notably, Windows, Wayland,   and Qt's eglfs (for embedded devices with an OpenGL implementation) including   the Raspberry Pi. * New element `qmlglsrc` to record a QML scene into a GStreamer pipeline.  KMS video sink  * New element `kmssink` to render video using Direct Rendering Manager   (DRM) and Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) subsystems in the Linux   kernel. It is oriented to be used mostly in embedded systems.  Wayland video sink  * `waylandsink` now supports the wl\_viewporter extension allowing   video scaling and cropping to be delegated to the Wayland   compositor. This extension is also been made optional, so that it can   also work on current compositors that don't support it. It also now has   support for the video meta, allowing zero-copy operations in more   cases.  DVB improvements  * `dvbsrc` now has better delivery-system autodetection and several   new parameter sanity-checks to improve its resilience to configuration   omissions and errors. Superfluous polling continues to be trimmed down,   and the debugging output has been made more consistent and precise.   Additionally, the channel-configuration parser now supports the new dvbv5   format, enabling `dvbbasebin` to automatically playback content transmitted   on delivery systems that previously required manual description, like ISDB-T.  DASH, HLS and adaptivedemux  * HLS now has support for Alternate Rendition audio and video tracks. Full   support for Alternate Rendition subtitle tracks will be in an upcoming release. * DASH received support for keyframe-only trick modes if the   `GST_SEEK_FLAG_TRICKMODE_KEY_UNITS` flag is given when seeking. It will   only download keyframes then, which should help with high-speed playback.   Changes to skip over multiple frames based on bandwidth and other metrics   will be added in the near future. * Lots of reliability fixes around seek handling and bitrate switching.  Bluetooth improvements  * The `avdtpsrc` element now supports metadata such as track title, artist   name, and more, which devices can send via AVRCP. These are published as   tags on the pipeline. * The `a2dpsink` element received some love and was cleaned up so that it   actually works after the initial GStreamer 1.0 port.  GStreamer VAAPI  * All the decoders have been split, one plugin feature per codec. So   far, the available ones, depending on the driver, are:   `vaapimpeg2dec`, `vaapih264dec`, `vaapih265dec`, `vaapivc1dec`, `vaapivp8dec`,   `vaapivp9dec` and `vaapijpegdec` (which already was split). * Improvements when mapping VA surfaces into memory. It now differentiates   between negotiation caps and allocations caps, since the allocation   memory for surfaces may be bigger than one that is going to be   mapped. * `vaapih265enc` now supports constant bitrate mode (CBR). * Since several VA drivers are unmaintained, we decide to keep a whitelist   with the va drivers we actually test, which is mostly the i915 and to a lesser   degree gallium from the mesa project. Exporting the environment variable   `GST_VAAPI_ALL_DRIVERS` disables the whitelist. * Plugin features are registered at run-time, according to their support by   the loaded VA driver. So only the decoders and encoder supported by the   system are registered. Since the driver can change, some dependencies are   tracked to invalidate the GStreamer registry and reload the plugin. * `dmabuf` importation from upstream has been improved, gaining performance. * `vaapipostproc` now can negotiate buffer transformations via caps. * Decoders now can do I-frame only reverse playback. This decodes I-frames   only because the surface pool is smaller than the required by the GOP to show all the   frames. * The upload of frames onto native GL textures has been optimized too, keeping   a cache of the internal structures for the offered textures by the sink.  V4L2 changes  * More pixels formats are now supported * Decoder is now using `G_SELECTION` instead of the deprecated `G_CROP` * Decoder now uses the `STOP` command to handle EOS * Transform element can now scale the pixel aspect ratio * Colorimetry support has been improved even more * We now support the `OUTPUT_OVERLAY` type of video node in v4l2sink  Miscellaneous  * `multiqueue`'s input pads gained a new `"group-id"` property which   can be used to group input streams. Typically one will assign   different id numbers to audio, video and subtitle streams for   example. This way `multiqueue` can make sure streams of the same   type advance in lockstep if some of the streams are unlinked and the   `"sync-by-running-time"` property is set. This is used in   decodebin3/playbin3 to implement almost-instantaneous stream   switching. The grouping is required because different downstream   paths (audio, video, etc.) may have different buffering/latency   etc. so might be consuming data from multiqueue with a slightly   different phase, and if we track different stream groups separately   we minimize stream switching delays and buffering inside the   `multiqueue`. * `alsasrc` now supports ALSA drivers without a position for each   channel, this is common in some professional or industrial hardware. * `libvpx` based decoders (`vp8dec` and `vp9dec`) now create multiple threads on   computers with multiple CPUs automatically. * `rfbsrc` - used for capturing from a VNC server - has seen a lot of   debugging. It now supports the latest version of the RFB   protocol and uses GIO everywhere. * `tsdemux` can now read ATSC E-AC-3 streams. * New `GstVideoDirection` video orientation interface for rotating, flipping   and mirroring video in 90Â° steps. It is implemented by the `videoflip` and   `glvideoflip` elements currently. * It is now possible to give `appsrc` a duration in time, and there is now a   non-blocking try-pull API for `appsink` that returns NULL if nothing is   available right now. * `x264enc` has support now for chroma-site and colorimetry settings * A new JPEG2000 parser element was added, and the JPEG2000 caps were cleaned   up and gained more information needed in combination with RTP and various   container formats. * Reverse playback support for `videorate` and `deinterlace` was implemented * Various improvements everywhere for reverse playback and `KEY_UNITS` trick mode * New cleaned up `rawaudioparse` and `rawvideoparse` elements that replace the   old `audioparse` and `videoparse` elements. There are compatibility element   factories registered with the old names to allow existing code to continue   to work. * The Decklink plugin gained support for 10 bit video SMPTE timecodes, and   generally got many bugfixes for various issues. * New API in `GstPlayer` for setting the multiview mode for stereoscopic   video, setting an HTTP/RTSP user agent and a time offset between audio and   video. In addition to that, there were various bugfixes and the new   gst-examples module contains Android, iOS, GTK+ and Qt example applications. * `GstBin` has new API for suppressing various `GstElement` or `GstObject`   flags that would otherwise be affected by added/removed child elements. This   new API allows `GstBin` subclasses to handle for themselves if they   should be considered a sink or source element, for example. * The `subparse` element can handle WebVTT streams now. * A new `sdpsrc` element was added that can read an SDP from a file, or get it   as a string as property and then sets up an RTP pipeline accordingly.  Plugin moves No plugins were moved this cycle. We'll make up for it next cycle, promise! Rewritten memory leak tracer GStreamer has had basic functionality to trace allocation and freeing of both mini-objects (buffers, events, caps, etc.) and objects in the form of the internal `GstAllocTrace` tracing system. This API was never exposed in the 1.x API series though. When requested, this would dump a list of objects and mini-objects at exit time which had still not been freed at that point, enabled with an environment variable. This subsystem has now been removed in favour of a new implementation based on the recently-added tracing framework.  Tracing hooks have been added to trace the creation and destruction of GstObjects and mini-objects, and a new tracer plugin has been written using those new hooks to track which objects are still live and which are not. If GStreamer has been compiled against the libunwind library, the new leaks tracer will remember where objects were allocated from as well. By default the leaks tracer will simply output a warning if leaks have been detected on `gst_deinit()`.  If the `GST_LEAKS_TRACER_SIG` environment variable is set, the leaks tracer will also handle the following UNIX signals:   * `SIGUSR1`: log alive objects * `SIGUSR2`: create a checkpoint and print a list of objects created and   destroyed since the previous checkpoint.   Unfortunately this will not work on Windows due to no signals, however.  If the `GST_LEAKS_TRACER_STACK_TRACE` environment variable is set, the leaks tracer will also log the creation stack trace of leaked objects. This may significantly increase memory consumption however.  New `MAY_BE_LEAKED` flags have been added to GstObject and GstMiniObject, so that objects and mini-objects that are likely to stay around forever can be flagged and blacklisted from the leak output.  To give the new leak tracer a spin, simply call any GStreamer application such as `gst-launch-1.0` or `gst-play-1.0` like this:  ``` GST_TRACERS=leaks gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=10 ! fakesink  ```  If there are any leaks, a warning will be raised at the end.  It is also possible to trace only certain types of objects or mini-objects:  ``` GST_TRACERS="leaks(GstEvent,GstMessage)" gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=10 ! fakesink  ```  This dedicated leaks tracer is much much faster than valgrind since all code is executed natively instead of being instrumented. This makes it very suitable for use on slow machines or embedded devices. It is however limited to certain types of leaks and won't catch memory leaks when the allocation has been made via plain old `malloc()` or `g_malloc()` or other means. It will also not trace non-GstObject GObjects.  The goal is to enable leak tracing on GStreamer's Continuous-Integration and testing system, both for the regular unit tests (make check) and media tests (gst-validate), so that accidental leaks in common code paths can be detected and fixed quickly.  For more information about the new tracer, check out Guillaume Desmottes's ["Tracking Memory Leaks"](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/tracking-memory-leaks/) talk or his [blog post](https://blog.desmottes.be/?post/2016/06/20/GStreamer-leaks-tracer) about the topic. GES and NLE changes  * Clip priorities are now handled by the layers, and the GESTimelineElement   priority property is now deprecated and unused * Enhanced (de)interlacing support to always use the `deinterlace` element   and expose needed properties to users * Allow reusing clips children after removing the clip from a layer * We are now testing many more rendering formats in the gst-validate   test suite, and failures have been fixed. * Also many bugs have been fixed in this cycle!  GStreamer validate changes This cycle has been focused on making GstValidate more than just a validating tool, but also a tool to help developers debug their GStreamer issues. When reporting issues, we try to gather as much information as possible and expose it to end users in a useful way. For an example of such enhancements, check out Thibault Saunier's [blog post](improving-debugging-gstreamer-validate) about the new Not Negotiated Error reporting mechanism.  Playbin3 support has been added so we can run validate tests with `playbin3` instead of playbin.  We are now able to properly communicate between `gst-validate-launcher` and launched subprocesses with actual IPC between them. That has enabled the test launcher to handle failing tests specifying the exact expected issue(s). gst-libav changes gst-libav uses the recently released ffmpeg 3.2 now, which brings a lot of improvements and bugfixes from the ffmpeg team in addition to various new codec mappings on the GStreamer side and quite a few bugfixes to the GStreamer integration to make it more robust. Build and DependenciesExperimental support for Meson as build systemOverview We have have added support for building GStreamer using the [Meson build system](http://mesonbuild.com/). This is currently experimental, but should work fine at least on Linux using the gcc or clang toolchains and on Windows using the MingW or MSVC toolchains.  Autotools remains the primary build system for the time being, but we hope to someday replace it and will steadily work towards that goal.  More information about the background and implications of all this and where we're hoping to go in future with this can be found in [Tim's mail](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/gstreamer-devel/2016-September/060231.html) to the gstreamer-devel mailing list.  For more information on Meson check out [these videos](http://mesonbuild.com/videos.html) and also the [Meson talk](https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/videos/gstreamer-development-on-windows-ans-faster-builds-everywhere-with-meson/) at the GStreamer Conference.  Immediate benefits for Linux users are faster builds and rebuilds. At the time of writing the Meson build of GStreamer is used by default in GNOME's jhbuild system.  The Meson build currently still lacks many of the fine-grained configuration options to enable/disable specific plugins. These will be added back in due course.  Note: The meson build files are not distributed in the source tarballs, you will need to get GStreamer from git if you want try it out. Windows Visual Studio toolchain support Windows users might appreciate being able to build GStreamer using the MSVC toolchain, which is not possible using autotools. This means that it will be possible to debug GStreamer and applications in Visual Studio, for example. We require VS2015 or newer for this at the moment.  There are two ways to build GStreamer using the MSVC toolchain:   1. Using the MSVC command-line tools (`cl.exe` etc.) via Meson's "ninja" backend. 2. Letting Meson's "vs2015" backend generate Visual Studio project files that    can be opened in Visual Studio and compiled from there.   This is currently only for adventurous souls though. All the bits are in place, but support for all of this has not been merged into GStreamer's cerbero build tool yet at the time of writing. This will hopefully happen in the next cycle, but for now this means that those wishing to compile GStreamer with MSVC will have to get their hands dirty.  There are also no binary SDK builds using the MSVC toolchain yet.  For more information on GStreamer builds using Meson and the Windows toolchain check out Nirbheek Chauhan's blog post ["Building and developing GStreamer using Visual Studio"](http://blog.nirbheek.in/2016/07/building-and-developing-gstreamer-using.html). Dependenciesgstreamer libunwind was added as an optional dependency. It is used only for debugging and tracing purposes.  The `opencv` plugin in gst-plugins-bad can now be built against OpenCV version 3.1, previously only 2.3-2.5 were supported. gst-plugins-ugly  * `mpeg2dec` now requires at least libmpeg2 0.5.1 (from 2008).  gst-plugins-bad  * `gltransformation` now requires at least graphene 1.4.0. * `lv2` now plugin requires at least lilv 0.16 instead of slv2.  Packaging notes Packagers please note that the `gst/gstconfig.h` public header file in the GStreamer core library moved back from being an architecture dependent include to being architecture independent, and thus it is no longer installed into `$(libdir)/gstreamer-1.0/include/gst` but into the normal include directory where it lives happily ever after with all the other public header files. The reason for this is that we now check whether the target supports unaligned memory access based on predefined compiler macros at compile time instead of checking it at configure time. Platform-specific improvementsAndroidNew universal binaries for all supported ABIs We now provide a "universal" tarball to allow building apps against all the architectures currently supported (x86, x86-64, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v8a). This is needed for building with recent versions of the Android NDK which defaults to building against all supported ABIs. Use [the Android player example](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/commit/playback/player/android?id=a5cdde9119f038a1eb365aca20faa9741a38e788) as a reference for the required changes. Miscellaneous  * New `ahssrc` element that allows reading the hardware sensors, e.g. compass   or accelerometer.  macOS (OS/X) and iOS  * Support for querying available devices on OS/X via the GstDeviceProvider   API was added. * It is now possible to create OpenGL|ES 3.x contexts on iOS and use them in   combination with the VideoToolbox based decoder element. * many OpenGL/GLES improvements, see OpenGL section above  Windows  * gstconfig.h: Always use dllexport/import on Windows with MSVC * Miscellaneous fixes to make libs and plugins compile with the MVSC toolchain * MSVC toolchain support (see Meson section above for more details)  New Modules for Documentation, Examples, Meson Build Three new git modules have been added recently: gst-docs This is a new module where we will maintain documentation in the markdown format.  It contains the former gstreamer.com SDK tutorials which have kindly been made available by Fluendo under a Creative Commons license. The tutorials have been reviewed and updated for GStreamer 1.x and will be available as part of the [official GStreamer documentation](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/) going forward. The old gstreamer.com site will then be shut down with redirects pointing to the updated tutorials.  Some of the existing docbook XML-formatted documentation from the GStreamer core module such as the *Application Development Manual* and the *Plugin Writer's Guide* have been converted to markdown as well and will be maintained in the gst-docs module in future. They will be removed from the GStreamer core module in the next cycle.  This is just the beginning. Our goal is to provide a more cohesive documentation experience for our users going forward, and easier to create and maintain documentation for developers. There is a lot more work to do, get in touch if you want to help out.  If you encounter any problems or spot any omissions or outdated content in the new documentation, please [file a bug in bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GStreamer&component=documentation) to let us know.  We will probably release gst-docs as a separate tarball for distributions to package in the next cycle. gst-examples A new [module](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/) has been added for examples. It does not contain much yet, currently it only contains a small [http-launch](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/network/http-launch/) utility that serves a pipeline over http as well as various [GstPlayer playback frontends](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-examples/tree/playback/player) for Android, iOS, Gtk+ and Qt.  More examples will be added over time. The examples in this repository should be more useful and more substantial than most of the examples we ship as part of our other modules, and also written in a way that makes them good example code. If you have ideas for examples, let us know.  No decision has been made yet if this module will be released and/or packaged. It probably makes sense to do so though. gst-build [gst-build](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-build/tree/) is a new meta module to build GStreamer using the new Meson build system. This module is not required to build GStreamer with Meson, it is merely for convenience and aims to provide a development setup similar to the existing `gst-uninstalled` setup.  gst-build makes use of Meson's [subproject feature](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/wiki/Subprojects) and sets up the various GStreamer modules as subprojects, so they can all be updated and built in parallel.  This module is still very new and highly experimental. It should work at least on Linux and Windows (OS/X needs some build fixes). Let us know of any issues you encounter by popping into the `#gstreamer` IRC channel or by [filing a bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GStreamer&component=gst-build).  This module will probably not be released or packaged (does not really make sense). Contributors Aaron Boxer, Aleix Conchillo FlaquÃ©, Alessandro Decina, Alexandru BÄluÈ, Alex Ashley, Alex-P.

Subject: gstreamer multiple issues

Hi,

After the blogposts from Chris Evans about gstreamer insecurities I had
a look.

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774859>
Invalid memory read in flx_decode_chunks (gst-plugins-good)
The fix is a larger rewrite of the affected code paths and probably
fixed a bunch of other issues on the way. It also fixes the second flic
bug reported by Chris Evans described here:
<https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.dk/2016/11/0day-poc-incorrect-fix-for-gstreamer.html>

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774896>
h264: one byte heap off by one read in gst_h264_parse_set_caps
(gst-plugins-bad)

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774897>
Invalid memory read in glib caused by one invalid unref call in the
flxdec decoder. (gst-plugins-good)

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=774902>
4 byte heap out of bounds read in windows_icon_typefind
(gst-plugins-base)

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775048>
2 byte heap out of bounds read in gst_mpegts_section_new
(gst-plugins-bad).

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775120>
null pointer deref (segfault) in mpegts decoder / _parse_pat
(gst-plugins-bad)

A note about the memory access bugs: glib's slice allocator can hide
them, so finding them with asan sometimes only works if one sets
G_SLICE=always-malloc

Stuff that's probably not security relevant:

Asserts / traps only:

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775130>
h264 decoder assert (gst-plugins-bad)

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=775219>
avidemux trap on invalid utf-8

The gstreamer devs were very quick in fixing all issues. The release
1.10.2 should contain all the fixes.
<https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gstreamer/1.10.2.html>

## Topic

An update for gstreamer-plugins-good is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

GStreamer is a streaming media framework based on graphs of filters which operate on media data. The gstreamer-plugins-good packages contain a collection of well-supported plug-ins of good quality and under the LGPL license.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were discovered in GStreamer's FLC/FLI/FLX media file format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause an application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2016-9634, CVE-2016-9635, CVE-2016-9636, CVE-2016-9808)
* An invalid memory read access flaw was found in GStreamer's FLC/FLI/FLX media file format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GStreamer to crash. (CVE-2016-9807)

Note: This updates removes the vulnerable FLC/FLI/FLX plug-in.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
