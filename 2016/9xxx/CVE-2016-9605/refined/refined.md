The provided content relates to CVE-2016-9605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of parameters in the Cobbler software, specifically within the profile page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Additionally, the improper parameter validation can lead to arbitrary file reading.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform arbitrary file reading by manipulating the `script` parameter. A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in a user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `script` parameter, targeting the `/cblr/svc/profile/<valid_profile>/op/script` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Cobbler server. No special privileges are needed. They also need to know a valid profile name to use in the URL.
