Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Sonicwall Secure Remote Access (SRA) server's web administrative interface, specifically the `/cgi-bin/diagnostics` component, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a `system()` call. This occurs when handling the `tsrDeleteRestartedFile` and `currentTSREmailTo` parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The application does not escape shell metacharacters in the provided input, allowing for arbitrary commands to be executed on the underlying system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) with shell access to the remote machine under the 'nobody' user account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP GET requests to the `/cgi-bin/diagnostics` endpoint.
    *   The attacker can inject commands within the `currentTSREmailTo` or `tsrDeleteRestartedFile` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Sonicwall SRA server's web interface.
    *   No authentication is explicitly stated as a requirement, implying that this vulnerability may be accessible without login. However, the presence of a cookie suggests there may be an implicit session requirement.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Russell Sanford of Critical Start.
*   The vulnerability was tested against version 8.1.0.2-14sv.
*   The exploit examples demonstrate how to inject commands by appending shell commands with `|` and `||` to the vulnerable parameters.
*   The exploit examples show how to redirect the output of the injected command to a file (`/tmp/xort` or `/tmp/xort2`).
