Based on the provided content, here's an analysis for each CVE:

**CVE-2016-9101**

*   **Root Cause:**  A memory leak in the i8255x (PRO100) NIC emulation within QEMU. Specifically, it occurs when repeatedly unplugging the device.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory leak due to improper handling of resource deallocation when an emulated NIC device is unplugged.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local privileged guest OS user can cause a denial of service (DoS) on the host by repeatedly unplugging the NIC, leading to memory exhaustion and potentially crashing the QEMU process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A privileged user within the guest operating system can trigger the memory leak.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local guest OS administrator privileges are required.

**CVE-2016-9105**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory leak in the `v9fs_link` function of QEMU's 9pfs implementation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The flaw is triggered by a failure to correctly handle a source file ID (`fid`) object within the 9pfs file system emulation, resulting in a memory leak.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local guest OS administrator can cause a denial of service by exhausting host memory.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered through interaction with the 9pfs filesystem.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Local guest OS administrator privileges are needed to perform the operation to trigger the leak.

**CVE-2016-9106**

*  **Root Cause**: Memory leak in the `v9fs_write` function in QEMU's 9pfs implementation due to a failure to free an IO vector.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The vulnerability lies in the handling of IO vectors during write operations in the 9pfs filesystem emulation. An IO vector isn't freed under certain conditions, leading to memory exhaustion.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: A local guest OS administrator can cause a denial of service by exhausting host memory.
*   **Attack Vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered through write operations using the 9pfs filesystem.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Local guest OS administrator privileges are required to trigger the memory leak by making use of the 9pfs interface.

**CVE-2016-8669**

*   **Root Cause:** A divide-by-zero error in the `serial_update_parameters` function within QEMU's serial device emulation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability arises because the code does not properly validate the `divider` value against the `baud_base`, leading to a divide-by-zero when the former is greater than the latter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local guest OS administrator can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, and the QEMU process to crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** This flaw is triggered when the guest OS manipulates the serial device parameters using the `serial_update_parameters` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest operating system.

**CVE-2016-8910**

*   **Root Cause:**  An infinite loop vulnerability in the `rtl8139_cplus_transmit` function within the RTL8139 ethernet emulation in QEMU.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability results from a lack of validation of the ring descriptor count in the RTL8139 emulation. An attacker can bypass limitations and trigger a loop by manipulating the count.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local guest OS administrator can trigger an infinite loop, leading to DoS through CPU exhaustion.
*   **Attack Vectors:** This issue is exploited by manipulating the network interface in guest and transmitting data which does not follow restrictions, causing infinite loop.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local guest OS administrator privileges are needed.
