* inc/cachehandlers/memcache.php
* inc/cachehandlers/memcached.php
* inc/cachehandlers/xcache.php
* inc/class\_parser.php
* install/resources/upgrade35.php
* search.php

You do not need to run the installer or make any further changes. You can use the file verification tool to determine whether you have the latest package, the file above will appear to be modified if you need to download an updated copy.

We apologise of any inconvenience.

    Quick question, will MyBB eventually have a super-convenient upgrade system, like WordPress? A system where the admin can hit ‚ÄúUPGRADE‚Äù and the whole thing happens, in a few seconds?

#### Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities

If you think you‚Äôve found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we‚Äôve had time to prepare and release a patch.

As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the¬†[Contact Us](http://www.mybb.com/contact/)¬†page or in our¬†[Private Inquiries](http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html)¬†forum ‚Äì where you can start a new thread that only you and the MyBB Team can see.

## MyBB Merge System 1.8.8

MyBB Merge System 1.8.8 is¬†[now available](http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/merge_1808.zip)¬†on the MyBB website and is a maintenance update to the MyBB Merge 1.8 series.

This release is to ensure that all users of MyBB Merge 1.8 have the latest fixes.

This release fixes several reported issues since the release of 1.8.7, which caused some incorrect functionality of the Merge System. These bugs have been fixed to provide a more stable version of the Merge System for public use.

#### What‚Äôs new in this version?

* 5 bug fixes ([View all](https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?q=milestone%3A1.8.8))
* Preliminary support for merges from vBulletin 5 installations. This module hasn‚Äôt had a lot of testing, so please report back with how vBulletin 5 merges go and always test your merge on a local machine first.

**Important note**

This will be the last release of the Merge System 1.8. We‚Äôre instead concentrating development efforts on MyBB 2.0 and a brand new Merge System to accompany it ‚Äì please stay tuned for more news on the new merge system!

Thanks,

MyBB Team

   inc/config.php wasn‚Äôt updated with new variables. Also I don‚Äôt see any documentation on them.

     Hi,

     If I remember correctly, the system will act as it previously did if the config variables aren‚Äôt present so we chose to omit adding them in order to not cause unexpected changes to behaviour.

     Documentation is incoming ASAP but we didn‚Äôt want to block the release any further.

   An example config would be nice. To do a test install just to see the lines as-is seems time consuming. Also how about an /inc/config.example.php file because /inc/config.default.php is an empty file. Sometimes people mistakenly blank out their config file and an example would go a long way to fix that.It could also contain documentation for the parameters.
