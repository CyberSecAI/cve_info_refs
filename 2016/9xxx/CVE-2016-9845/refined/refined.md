Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9845:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `virgl_cmd_get_capset_info` function within the QEMU's virtio-gpu-3d component.
- The response structure (`resp`) was not fully initialized before being written back to the guest. Specifically, the padding fields `resp.padding` and `resp.hdr.padding` were not set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:**  Due to the lack of initialization, the uninitialized memory contents of the `resp.padding` and `resp.hdr.padding` fields were being sent to the guest. This leaked host memory to the guest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest user or process could read arbitrary contents of host memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by a guest sending a `VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET_INFO` command to the QEMU virtual GPU device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code within a QEMU guest with a virtual GPU device configured.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch addresses the issue by adding `memset(&resp, 0, sizeof(resp));` before the response is constructed, ensuring the structure is properly initialized and no uninitialized memory is leaked.
- The vulnerability is exploitable locally from within the guest.
- Gentoo identified the vulnerability in `app-emulation/qemu` versions prior to 2.8.0.
