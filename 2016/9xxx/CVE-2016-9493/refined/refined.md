Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the name and message fields of the PHP forms generated by the PHP FormMail Generator. Specifically, it fails to neutralize script-related HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS):** The generated PHP forms are vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User-supplied input to the name and message fields is not sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the name or message fields.
- This malicious code is then stored by the application.
- When an administrator accesses the administrator panel, the stored XSS payload is executed within their browser.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or further compromise of the administrator's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can submit a specially crafted form with malicious JavaScript code in the name or message fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs no special privileges or authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the form.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the local network or have any kind of prior access.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is specifically located in PHP forms generated by the PHP FormMail Generator prior to December 17, 2016.
- The vulnerability allows stored XSS, meaning that the malicious code is stored on the server and executed when viewed by an administrator.
- The issue is not resolved by regenerating code with the updated tool, and requires manual updates using PHP `htmlentities` or similar methods.
