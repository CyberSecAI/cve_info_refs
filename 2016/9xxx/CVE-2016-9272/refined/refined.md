```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of the `rerank` array parameter within the `manage_ranks` action of the `container` controller. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to site database information disclosure and denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP POST request to `/exponent/` with a crafted `action`, `controller`, and `lastpage` parameters. The `lastpage` parameter contains the malicious SQL injection payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/exponent/` endpoint. No authentication is required."
