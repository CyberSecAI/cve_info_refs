- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the IBM QRadar SIEM not disabling external XML Entity Processing. This leads to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability when processing XML data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity Injection (XXE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose highly sensitive information or consume all available memory resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker can send malicious XML data
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with the ability to send XML data to the vulnerable service.
