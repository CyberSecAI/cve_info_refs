- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `as_sindex__simatch_by_iname` function. The function uses `snprintf` with a size argument based on the length of the attacker-controlled input, rather than the size of the destination buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite stack memory, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the Aerospike server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can connect to the Aerospike server's port and send a malformed query message. No prior authentication or specific access is needed to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker must craft a query message with a long index name to trigger the overflow in the `as_sindex__simatch_by_iname` function.
