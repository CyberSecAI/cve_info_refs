```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not verify if requests are intentionally submitted by the proper user.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to the complete compromise of an affected system.
- Attack vectors: Remote network-based attacks.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious web page to trigger the CSRF attack. User interaction is required, but no prior authentication is required by the attacker.
