Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-9113

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. Specifically, the `image->comps[0].data` pointer is NULL when accessed in the `imagetobmp` function within `convertbmp.c`. This occurs because the `data` member of the `image->comps[0]` structure is not assigned a valid memory address, leading to an attempt to dereference a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to access memory through a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. The program does not check if the `data` pointer is valid before dereferencing it.
- **Uninitialized data:** The `p_image_dest->comps[0].data` is not properly initialized in some cases, more specifically when  `p_j2k->m_specific_param.m_decoder.m_can_decode` is 0 in `j2k.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the `opj_decompress` tool due to a segmentation fault (SEGV). This can be leveraged to cause a denial of service. The provided Gentoo security advisory also indicates that arbitrary code execution is a possibility via this or similar vulnerabilities, but the github issue alone does not confirm that for this particular vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted BMP/JPEG2000 File:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted BMP file or JPEG2000 file (j2k file) to be processed by the vulnerable `opj_decompress` tool. Specifically, the crafted file would need to result in a decoding path where the decoder flag `m_can_decode` is set to 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed image file to the affected software. This could involve either:
    - Local access, being able to use a crafted file as input to `opj_decompress`.
    - Remote access if the image processing functionality is exposed through a network interface or file processing service.

**Additional details from the GitHub issue**

- The specific code location of the vulnerability is in `/home/yang/openjpeg/openjpeg-2.1.2/src/bin/jp2/convertbmp.c:980`.
- The issue was reported against `OPENJPEG-2.1.2`.
- The AddressSanitizer and GDB output confirm that the crash happens due to the null pointer dereference of `image->comps[0].data`.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) file was mentioned, and the reporter indicated willingness to share it via email.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `imagetobmp` function due to the decoder sometimes failing to allocate a memory region to `p_image_dest->comps[0].data`. It can be triggered by a specially crafted BMP or j2k file and can lead to denial of service.
