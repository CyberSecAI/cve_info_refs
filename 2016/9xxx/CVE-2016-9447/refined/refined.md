  "CVE-2016-9447": {
    "description": "A memory corruption flaw was found in GStreamer's Nintendo NSF music file format decoding plug-in. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using GStreamer to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper bounds checking when mapping ROM data into 6502 memory and during bank switching in the NSF plugin of gstreamer-0.10, which allows loading or bank switching of ROM data to writable memory locations",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out of bounds write",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause an application using GStreamer to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending an exploit via an e-mail attachment.",
      "Partial drive-by download by abusing Chrome's file download UX.",
       "Full drive-by download by abusing Chrome download UX.",
      "USB drive based attacks."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted NSF file. An attacker could rename the NSF file to something else (e.g., .mp3) to trick the user into opening it in a media player.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the emulator component of the NSF plugin, which emulates a 6502 CPU. The emulator allows loading or bank switching of ROM data below 0x8000. A specially crafted NSF file loads opcodes that cause memory out-of-bounds writes relative to the host emulator heap. The vulnerability is present in gstreamer-0.10. A second NSF player based on libgme is not affected."
