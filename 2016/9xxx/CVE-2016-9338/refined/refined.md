- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission assignment for critical resources. Specifically, users with administrator privileges can remove all other administrative users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrative privileges can remove all other administrators, requiring a factory reset of the device to restore the ancillary web server functionality. The device will still function as a controller, but management via the web interface will be lost.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, remote attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator privileges on the affected device.
