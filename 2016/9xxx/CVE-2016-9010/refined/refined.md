- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WebSphere Message Broker / IBM Integration Bus WEBUI does not set the X-FRAME-OPTIONS header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of X-FRAME-OPTIONS header, which makes the application vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can hijack a victim's click actions by persuading them to visit a malicious website, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**  Persuading a victim to visit a malicious website that embeds the vulnerable application in an iframe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website, and the victim must be a user of the vulnerable application.
