Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9816:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability arises from how Xen on ARM handles asynchronous aborts (SError on ARMv8) triggered by guest VMs. Specifically, if a guest triggers an asynchronous abort and the hypervisor is entered (via HVC or IRQ) before the abort is delivered, the hypervisor fails to catch the abort because the PSTATE.A bit (which enables asynchronous aborts) is masked. This means the abort could be delivered to the next running guest, or cause the host to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Asynchronous Aborts:** The hypervisor fails to properly handle asynchronous aborts generated by guest VMs when the hypervisor is entered before the abort is delivered, leading to a race condition.
*  **PSTATE.A bit:** The PSTATE.A bit masking within the hypervisor prevents it from catching guest-generated asynchronous aborts under specific circumstances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host Crash:** A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability, causing the Xen hypervisor to crash, leading to a denial of service for all guests on the host.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation (Implied):** The text also mentions that the asynchronous abort "may be slipped to the next running guest with PSTATE.A bit unmasked", which may imply further unknown exploitation could be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest VM:** A malicious guest VM can trigger the vulnerability by accessing memory-mapped hardware in a way that causes an asynchronous abort.
*   **Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO):** The vulnerability is related to a guest VM's interaction with memory-mapped hardware (MMIO) that the hypervisor exposes for hardware virtualization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest VM Control:** An attacker needs control over a guest VM running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
*   **Ability to Trigger Aborts:** The attacker needs the ability to trigger asynchronous aborts within the guest VM, typically by accessing hardware or memory regions in specific, unexpected ways.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided code snippet shows how the fix works. It unmasks the PSTATE.A bit in the hypervisor to create a "window" to catch guest-generated asynchronous aborts during transitions from EL1 to EL2 (guest to hypervisor). If an abort is detected in this window, the hypervisor crashes the offending guest.
*   The fix also includes a function `check_pending_vserror` which checks for pending virtual SError in EL1->EL2 transitions.
* The advisory states that x86 systems are not affected by this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability is present in all Xen versions which support ARM.

In summary, CVE-2016-9816 describes a vulnerability in Xen on ARM where a malicious guest can crash the host by triggering asynchronous aborts that the hypervisor does not handle correctly. The patch addresses this issue by modifying the hypervisor to detect and properly handle these guest-induced aborts.
