Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free or double-free error that occurs within the JPC encoder of the JasPer library.
*   Specifically, certain pointer variables are not set to NULL after calls to `free()`, which can lead to the code attempting to free the same memory again, resulting in a double-free or use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Use-after-free: Memory is accessed after it has been freed.
*   Double-free: Memory is freed multiple times.
*   Incorrect memory management in the JPC encoder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** While some descriptions primarily mention crashes, there's also a potential for arbitrary code execution, indicated in the Gentoo Security Advisory. This likely comes from the use of memory after it's been freed or a double free operation.
*   **Denial of Service:** The more common outcome mentioned is the application crashing, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   The impact will depend on the specific application that uses the vulnerable version of JasPer library

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file with the vulnerable library.
*   The crafted file can be provided to an application using JasPer either locally or remotely
*   The vulnerability resides within the encoder. Therefore, a user might need to be enticed into converting a malicious JPEG-2000 file to another format by the vulnerable application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file.
*   The attacker needs to induce the user/application to process the malicious file by the vulnerable library (via network, locally etc)
*   The attacker does not need authentication in the reported cases, suggesting the issue occurs before any access control.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Liu Bingchang (IIE).
*   The issue was fixed in JasPer version 2.0.12.
*   Several Red Hat products were affected and an update (RHSA-2017:1208) was released to address this.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3827-1) also addresses this vulnerability.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entries (1406405, 1410026) provide detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix that addresses it.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201707-07) includes a few CVEs including CVE-2016-9591 and confirms that arbitrary code execution is possible.
