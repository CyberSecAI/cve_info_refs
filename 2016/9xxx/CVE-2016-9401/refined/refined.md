{
  "CVE-2016-9401": {
    "Description": "The `popd` builtin in Bash can be tricked into freeing user-supplied addresses. Specifically, when called with a negative out-of-range offset (e.g., `popd +-111111`), it can lead to a controlled free and potentially a use-after-free condition.",
    "Root cause": "The `popd` command does not properly validate user-supplied offsets, allowing an attacker to specify an invalid memory location for freeing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Controlled free",
      "Use-after-free"
     ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting a use-after-free condition. This could also bypass restricted shells (rsh) in certain environments.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via the `popd` command",
      "Bypassing restricted shells"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
       "Local user with the ability to execute shell commands",
       "Ability to provide a crafted popd command",
       "In some environments, may require the ability to bypass restricted shells"
    ]
  }
