Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs in the `imagetoraw_common` function within `convert.c` at line 2226, specifically when accessing `*ptr`.
- The pointer `ptr` was assigned the value of `image->comps[compno].data`, which is `NULL`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The program attempts to access memory at a null address, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The program crashes due to a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service.
- According to the Gentoo advisory, a remote attacker could also potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted JP2 image file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path in `imagetoraw_common`. The Gentoo advisory also mentions crafted BMP or PDF files as possible vectors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file (JP2, BMP, or PDF) to the vulnerable application/library.
- No specific privileges are needed beyond the ability to provide such files as an input.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in `OpenJPEG-2.1.2`.
- The provided GDB information shows that `image->comps[compno].data` is `0x0`, which is a null pointer, causing a segmentation fault when dereferenced at `*ptr`.
- The Address Sanitizer output confirms the segmentation fault on an unknown address 0x00000000.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201710-26) lists this CVE alongside multiple other vulnerabilities affecting OpenJPEG and indicates that remote code execution is possible.
