Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9559:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `TIFFGetProperties` function within the `coders/tiff.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code was not properly checking if the `text` pointer returned by the `TIFFGetField` function was `NULL` before passing it to `SetImageProperty`. The `SetImageProperty` function expects a non-null string argument and is declared with the `nonnull` attribute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a runtime error due to the null pointer dereference. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application. The application may terminate unexpectedly, preventing further image processing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image that causes `TIFFGetField` to return a `NULL` pointer for certain metadata fields (like TIFFTAG_ARTIST, TIFFTAG_COPYRIGHT etc.) .

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted TIFF image as input to ImageMagick. This could be through a command-line tool, a web application, or any other program that utilizes the ImageMagick library.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs specifically at line 655 of `coders/tiff.c`.
- The fix involves adding null pointer checks before calling `SetImageProperty`. The patch ensures that if the text pointer returned by `TIFFGetField` is NULL, `SetImageProperty` is not called with this NULL pointer.
- The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) and the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan)
- The affected version is ImageMagick 7.0.3.6 and the fix is in 7.0.3.7
