Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-9117

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `imagetopnm` function within `convert.c` (specifically related to jp2 format handling) in OpenJPEG.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a member (likely `data`) of a `image->comps[0]` structure without ensuring that the pointer `image->comps[0]` is not NULL. The provided GDB information confirms that `image->comps[0]->data` is equal to `0x0`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) which crashes the `opj_decompress` application. This constitutes a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JP2 File:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JP2 file to an application or service using OpenJPEG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JP2 file as input to a system or application utilizing the vulnerable OpenJPEG library. No special network position or privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Address Sanitizer output and GDB information offer greater insight into the technical details of the vulnerability than the CVE description alone.
- The issue report confirms the vulnerability is present in OpenJPEG version 2.1.2.
- The vulnerability is also listed in the Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201710-26 as one of the multiple vulnerabilities fixed by OpenJPEG version 2.3.0.
