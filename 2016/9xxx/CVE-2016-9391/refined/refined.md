## Analysis of CVE-2016-9391

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check in the `jpc_bitstream_getbits` function within the Jasper library's JPC bitstream code. Specifically, the code lacked proper validation of the number of bits requested (`n`), which could potentially be larger than what could be reliably handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The `jpc_bitstream_getbits` function did not adequately check if the requested bit count 'n' was within an acceptable range before processing it.
*   **Assertion Failure:** The lack of validation led to a reachable assertion failure when a larger than allowable integer was requested via `jpc_bitstream_getbits`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact was triggering an assertion failure, causing the application using the vulnerable Jasper library to terminate unexpectedly. This constitutes a denial of service.
*  **No Code Execution**: The vulnerability does not allow code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker could craft a specially designed JPEG 2000 image file containing a malformed bitstream. When processed by a vulnerable application using the Jasper library, the invalid bit count would trigger the assertion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to create or modify a JPEG 2000 image with specific properties to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to get the malicious file to the target application or user, potentially through various methods such as email attachments or malicious websites.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable function is `jpc_bitstream_getbits` in `src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_bs.c`
*   The assertion `n >= 0 && n < 32` failed when `n` was outside this range.
*   The fix involved adding a check: `if (n < 0 || n >= 32) { return -1; }`
*   The fix was introduced in upstream commit `1e84674d95353c64e5c4c0e7232ae86fd6ea813b`.
*   Test case can be found at `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00014-jasper-assert-jpc_bitstream_getbits`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo.
*   Red Hat assigned the CVE and addressed the issue in RHSA-2017:1208.
*   The issue was also addressed in Ubuntu USN-3693-1, and Debian.
*   The vulnerability was triggered by a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file that caused an assertion failure in the Jasper library's JPC bitstream code when a larger integer than handled is requested.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, attack vectors, and necessary remediation.
