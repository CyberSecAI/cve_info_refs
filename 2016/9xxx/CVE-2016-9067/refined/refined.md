Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9067:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore` function, triggered during DOM manipulation. Specifically, when a node is removed and then an attempt is made to access it, a use-after-free condition occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability lies in the use of a pointer to a heap-allocated object after it has been freed. This occurs due to incorrect handling of node references during DOM operations.
- **DOM Manipulation Issues:** The specific sequence of operations involving node removal and subsequent access triggers the flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The vulnerability leads to a crash due to accessing freed memory, this could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker can craft malicious web content that includes a specific sequence of DOM manipulation operations to trigger the vulnerability when a user loads the content in the browser.
- **JavaScript:** The use of Javascript to perform the necessary DOM operations is necessary for triggering the vulnerability
- **DOM Event Listener:** The `DOMNodeRemoved` event listener is used to trigger actions which cause the use-after-free

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious web content to the victim, either through direct access to a web page or through mechanisms like cross-site scripting (XSS) or malicious advertisements.
- Basic knowledge of web development is necessary to craft the malicious HTML/JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
- The user must interact with the malicious content by loading the website into a vulnerable browser.
- Some tests require the use of a `fuzzPriv` addon to reliably trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in the context of implementing DOM4 methods, specifically related to `prepend`, `append`, `before`, `after`, and `replaceWith`.
- The fix involves ensuring that stack variables for node references are using `nsCOMPtr` to properly manage their lifetime.
- The bugzilla ticket for this CVE mentions a duplicate bug, Bug 1303168, which also a use-after-free but in the `nsINode::Before` function, showing that the issue is present in multiple DOM functions.
- This vulnerability affects Firefox versions before version 50 and was introduced with bug [911477](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=911477).
