The provided content describes CVE-2016-9569.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of a counter value provided through an IOCTL, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the counter is excessively large.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `cbstream.sys` driver.
- Insufficient input validation for the counter parameter supplied via IOCTL `0x62430028`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by causing a system crash (Blue Screen of Death - BSoD).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted IOCTL `0x62430028` to the `cbstream.sys` driver with an excessively large counter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have administrator privileges on the system.
