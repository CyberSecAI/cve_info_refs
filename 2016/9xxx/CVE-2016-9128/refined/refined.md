Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9128:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `affiliate-preview.php` script in the `www/admin` directory was vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of proper sanitization of the "charset" parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application echoes back user-supplied data (the `charset` parameter) without sanitizing or encoding it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can steal the session ID of an authenticated user by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted URL. This could lead to unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `charset` parameter.
*   The attacker would then need to trick a logged-in user into visiting the crafted URL (e.g., via a phishing email).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker doesn't require prior access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to click a malicious link.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`charset`).
