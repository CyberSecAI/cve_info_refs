  "CVE-2016-9395": {
    "description": "The jas_seq2d_create function in jas_seq.c in JasPer before 1.900.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) via a crafted file.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an assertion failure in the `jas_seq2d_create` function. The function receives arguments taken from variables of type `uint_fast32_t`, but its parameters are of type `int`. When one of the provided values is greater than `INT_MAX`, it is interpreted as a negative value within `jas_seq2d_create()`. This causes the end value to be smaller than the start value, leading to an assertion failure.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Assertion failure due to type mismatch and integer overflow/interpretation as negative",
        "Potential for denial of service due to program termination."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service by crashing the application or library using JasPer due to an assertion failure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted image files.",
        "Image files from untrusted sources."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that will cause a type mismatch resulting in negative interpretation of large integer values causing the assertion failure.",
        "additional_info": "The fix involves changing the function argument type from 'int' to 'int_fast32_t' to properly handle large values. However, it is noted that the fix changes the API/ABI, and hence cannot be backported as is to all versions.  A test case for this vulnerability is available at [https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00043-jasper-assert-jas_matrix_t](https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00043-jasper-assert-jas_matrix_t)."
