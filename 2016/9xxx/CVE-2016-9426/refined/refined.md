Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `renderTable()` function within `table.c` of the w3m browser. Specifically, a large `max_width` value (calculated based on the width attribute of a table tag in HTML), which is an integer is assigned to  `t->tabwidth[0]`, which is a short integer causing an integer overflow resulting in a negative number. This negative number is then passed as an argument to the function `Strnew_size` which is used to allocate memory. Due to another vulnerability in the memory allocator used by `w3m` i.e. `libgc` (specifically related to `GC_MALLOC_ATOMIC`), which is tracked by `CVE-2016-9427`, this resulted in allocation of a small memory block despite a large negative value being passed as an argument to allocate memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The direct assignment of a large integer value to a short integer variable leading to a negative size calculation and incorrect memory allocation.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The integer overflow results in a negative value being passed as size to a memory allocation function in `Strnew_size`, which then allocates a small block of memory, and the caller then tries to write large amount of data into the allocated memory block resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** The integer overflow and subsequent allocation with a small block of memory, and large writes lead to heap corruption within the program's memory space.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):**  The corrupted memory can be leveraged to overwrite critical data structures, control program flow or potentially execute arbitrary code. This is mentioned in the gentoo advisory.
*   **Denial of Service:** The overflow and memory corruption can crash the application or make it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTML file with a table tag having a very large width, specifically crafted to trigger the integer overflow during table rendering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML content to a user running a vulnerable version of `w3m`. This could be through a website, email, or any means that allows a user to load a malicious HTML file using `w3m`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is also described as triggering a related integer overflow issue in the `libgc` library (CVE-2016-9427), highlighting a cascading effect of vulnerabilities.
*   The Gentoo security advisory mentions that a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, indicating a high severity.
*   The issue was found using the afl-fuzz fuzzer.
*   The provided code snippet showing the crash in `Strnew_size` and `renderTable` further clarifies the technical details of the vulnerability.

This vulnerability is triggered when rendering tables with a large width attribute.
