The provided content relates to CVE-2016-9539.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `readContigTilesIntoBuffer` function within `tools/tiffcrop.c` in libtiff.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check when reading pixel data, potentially reading up to 3 bytes beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the `extractContigSamplesShifted32bits` function might attempt to read past the buffer when handling data from the tiff image.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this out-of-bounds read to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly leak sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted TIFF file using the `tiffcrop` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted TIFF file to the `tiffcrop` tool.
