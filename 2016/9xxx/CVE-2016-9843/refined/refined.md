Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-9843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `crc32_big` function within `crc32.c` in zlib.  It involves incorrect pointer arithmetic when calculating CRC values on big-endian systems. Specifically, the code prefaced a loop with a pointer decrement, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds memory access. This is not compliant with the C standard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Out-of-bounds pointer access**: The pre-decrement operation on the `buf4` pointer in `crc32_big` can cause the pointer to point to memory before the start of the allocated buffer.
- Violation of the C standard, resulting in undefined behavior

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The content indicates that it is mainly a code quality issue that may not manifest into a bug in all situations but may result in unspecified behavior.
-   The primary impact is potential code instability on big-endian systems and the possibility of crashes or other unexpected behavior arising from this out-of-bounds access.
- There are implications for denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution according to several sources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during CRC calculation, when a big-endian system attempts to use zlib's `crc32_big` function.
- The attack vector is primarily through network protocols or other means of sending data that needs zlib decompression and triggers this code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of the vulnerable `crc32_big` function using crafted or malicious data, which gets processed by zlib.
-  The attacker needs to be able to send data that will be processed by vulnerable software using a big endian architecture.

**Additional Notes**
*   The fix involves removing the pointer decrement before the loop and updating the loop to correctly handle memory. The fix also includes addressing similar pointer arithmetic issues in other parts of zlib, as well as issues regarding shifts of negative numbers
*   Several sources suggest that, while the vulnerability is present in code, it may not always manifest into an easily exploitable bug under all situations
*   This CVE is frequently mentioned alongside CVE-2016-9840, CVE-2016-9841, and CVE-2016-9842, which were also found during the same security audit of zlib
*   The vulnerability affects multiple products that use the zlib library, including rsync, Java, and various other software suites, necessitating broad patching efforts.
*   Some sources indicate the vulnerability was found by automated tools, which further emphasizes the importance of their role in uncovering vulnerabilities.
