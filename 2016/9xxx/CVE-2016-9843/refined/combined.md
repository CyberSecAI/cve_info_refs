-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Package        : rsync
Version        : 3.1.1-3+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9840 CVE-2016-9841 CVE-2016-9842 CVE-2016-9843
                 CVE-2018-5764

```
Trail of Bits used the automated vulnerability discovery tools developed
for the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge to audit zlib. As rsync, a fast,
versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool, uses an embedded copy of
zlib, those issues are also present in rsync.
```

CVE-2016-9840
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, remove offset pointer
     optimization, as this is not compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9841
     Only use post-increment to be compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9842
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, do not shift negative values,
     as this is not compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9843
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, do not pre-decrement a pointer
     in big-endian CRC calculation, as this is not compliant with the
     C standard.

CVE-2018-5764
     Prevent remote attackers from being able to bypass the
     argument-sanitization protection mechanism by ignoring --protect-args
     when already sent by client.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.1.1-3+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your rsync packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2420273.1).

Many industry experts anticipate that exploits leveraging known flaws in modern processor designs will continue to be disclosed for the foreseeable future (i.e., “Spectre” variants). For information related to these issues, please refer to:

* the January 2018 Critical Patch Update (and later) Advisories,
* the "Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre (CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754)" ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)), and
* "Information about processor vulnerabilities CVE-2018-3640 ("Spectre v3a") and CVE-2018-3639 ("Spectre v4")" ([Doc ID 2399123.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2399123.1)).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](//www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  13 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite.

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 16 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 44 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  38 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujul2018verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2018 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2018 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2394520.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2394520.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: zlib security issues found during audit

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> <https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source/Completed#zlib>
> <https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/0/09/Zlib-report.pdf>
> <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10i1KZS5so8xDqH2rplRa2xet0tyTvvJlLbQQmZIUIKE/edit>

> had some findings (1 medium, 4 low)

Here are 4 CVE IDs; it is not a one-to-one mapping.

> Finding 1: Incompatible declarations for external linkage function deflate (Medium)
> Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/3fb251b363866417122fe54a158a1ac5a7837101>

We feel that the scope of CVE should, ideally, omit unexploitable
code-quality issues. The PDF report has a number of comments about
Finding 1; however, one comment is "current compilers process this
code without issues." A finding can be important to the practice of
software development without being important for vulnerability
management. For now, the answer is that there is no CVE ID.

> Finding 2: Accessing a buffer of char via a pointer to unsigned int (Low)
> UNRESOLVED:This issue remains under discussion

There is no CVE ID. The PDF report mentions, for example, "There are several
possible fixes ... Do nothing."

> Finding 3: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c (Low)

> <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/6a043145ca6e9c55184013841a67b2fef87e44c0>

Use CVE-2016-9840.

> <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9aaec95e82117c1cb0f9624264c3618fc380cecb>

Use CVE-2016-9841.

> Finding 4: Undefined left shift of negative number (Low)
> Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/e54e1299404101a5a9d0cf5e45512b543967f958>

Use CVE-2016-9842.

> Finding 5: Big-endian out-of-bounds pointer (Low)
> Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/d1d577490c15a0c6862473d7576352a9f18ef811>

Use CVE-2016-9843.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 301 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2456979.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Synopsis

In August 2016, Mozilla engaged Trail of Bits to perform a security assessment of
Zlib as part of the Mozilla Secure Open Source (SOS) Fund. Zlib is an open source
compression library with a history of security vulnerabilities. Mozilla is interested in
the security of zlib because zlib is used in virtually every software package that
requires compression or decompression. Securing zlib will help secure the core
infrastructure of the Internet.

Trail of Bits

 used the automated vulnerability discovery tools

To perform this audit,
developed for the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge . These tools automatically
audited zlib for security vulnerabilities, delivering confidence while reducing costs.
 to augment our assessment
TrustInSoft
Additionally, we teamed with colleagues at
with the unique capabilities of their verification toolkit.

Engagement Goals

The goal of the engagement was to evaluate zlib for security vulnerabilities and to
serve as a proof-of-concept for automated software audits. The audit used a
two-pronged approach: testing to find bugs in the final compiled zlib library, and
verification to find latent bugs in the zlib source code.

The testing tools were used to search for memory safety vulnerabilities, such as
buffer overflows, heap overflows, out of bounds array access, and so on. Similar
bugs had been previously identified in zlib. The verification tools were used to
identify violations of the C standard; specifically, the use of undefined behavior.

Areas of Focus

The audit focused on the compression and decompression functionality provided
by zlib. While zlib exposes several APIs, it is the compression and decompression
functionality that typically processes untrusted input. This code may be reached via
two general paths: processing raw data input and processing GZip formatted input.
We tested both paths.

We did not inspect functions that query or set internal library state, provide
replacements for C file I/O functionality (other than necessary to test GZip
decoding), nor functions that deal with very specific zlib use cases, such as forcing
specific decompression strategies. These functions are unlikely to accept user input
or are very unlikely to be used in an application.

Recommendations Summary

Do not rely on undefined behavior.
zlib invokes undefined behavior in the C standard. Use of this code does not
currently generate buggy binaries, but it is possible that with future compilers or
platforms these latent bugs may manifest in compiled code.

 We have identified five areas where code in

Opt-in support for legacy compilers and micro-optimizations.
undefined behavior mostly appear in code that is designed to work around old,
buggy compilers or to provide micro-optimizations for specific architectures. Making
this behavior optional rather than default would result in cleaner builds for
common zlib usage.

Cases of

Deprecate support for ancient compilers
. Support for ancient buggy compilers
and hacks to work around their bugs needlessly increases the complexity of zlib's
codebase. Rarely used platforms should be deprecated to simplify the zlib
codebase, making the code easier to read, understand, and audit.

Deprecate architecture-specific micro-optimizations.
micro-optimizations should be eliminated. They needlessly increase complexity,
may introduce undefined behavior, and are likely unnecessary with modern
optimizing compilers.

 Architecture-specific

audits: the code base is very stable and updates are infrequent. The long release
cycle allows ample time to perform and respond to an automated security audit.
Periodic audits can prevent the introduction of new bugs into the zlib codebase.

Methodology

Testing Methodology

The Trail of Bits Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRS) uses a combination of symbolic and
concrete vulnerability hunting strategies to overcome roadblocks that stymie other
security tools. Developed to compete in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, it has
since been extended to operate on Linux binaries. The CRS uses a new technique
we call analysis boosting to combine our novel low-latency fuzzer with two symbolic
execution engines. Using this approach, we are able to gather a fine-grained picture
of program execution and identify subtle flaws that a human auditor would likely
miss.

- to exercise the compression, decompression, and GZip file format

The only prior requirement is the creation of a “driver” program to exercise target
functionality in zlib. We created drivers for four zlib APIs -

functionality inside zlib. These drivers were linked with zlib and run inside the CRS.
The CRS then investigated various program states, switching between concrete and
symbolic execution as needed to explore deeper in the zlib code. Each tested
function was run through the CRS for two weeks on a 48-core machine.

Testing Coverage
During this assessment, we focused on
typical zlib usage and code related to
compression and decompression
functionality. Zlib not only provides
functionality for compressing and
decompressing data, but it also
includes functionality to check
compression bounds, control internal
library state, operate on file streams,
special functionality to operate on large
files, etc.

The CRS generated very high coverage
for the location of previous zlib
vulnerabilities : the Huffman tree code
(inftrees.c: 98.3% line coverage, 93.7%
branch coverage, trees.c: 93.6% line
coverage, 89.4% branch coverage). The
file infback.c has 0% coverage; it is an
alternative to inflate.c and is used when
callback style I/O is preferred.

This coverage is a result of both invoking the compression related code directly and
via GZip functionality. This compares very favorably to the hand-crafted unit tests
that come with zlib, which generate 100% coverage for infback.c, inffast.c, and
inftrees.c, 98.6% coverage for inflate.c, and almost zero coverage for anything else.

Verification Methodology

TrustInSoft relies on a combination of formal method techniques that, together,
deliver powerful and efficient solutions for high-assurance software security
analysis. The tool used in this instance, TIS-interpreter, interprets C programs
statement by statement from beginning to end, verifying at each statement whether
the program can invoke undefined behavior. TIS-interpreter can detect violations of
the C standard even when applied to regression tests that have never revealed
previous problems.

Verification Details
TIS-interpreter, set to interpret the source code according to the
implementation-defined choices of GCC on x86-64, was launched on the minigzip
test program provided with zlib with inputs generated by afl-fuzz, and directly on
the
Execution in TIS-interpreter is tens of thousands of times slower than execution of
the same code when compiled. A minimal test suite exercising every reached
statement was extracted from the set of inputs generated by the CRS in order to be
executed inside TIS-interpreter.

 functions using inputs generated by the CRS.

compress

 and

TIS-interpreter was used in a mode in which both the possibilities of a null pointer
and a valid pointer being returned are considered, for each individual allocation.
Thus, the results obtained capture any possible behavior of zlib along the execution
of the tests for any interlacing of allocation successes and failure.

In addition, the list of remaining allocated memory blocks was checked to be empty
for each of these possible executions, thus checking that zlib does not have any
memory leak for any sequence of allocations successes and failures when handling
the inputs.

Findings Summary

This section covers our findings from both a software testing and a software
verification standpoint. Software testing attempts to identify vulnerabilities that are
present in compiled binary code; software verification identifies vulnerabilities that
are present at the source level. These vulnerabilities may not manifest as problems
right now, but could at a later date (e.g. when compilers make different
assumptions about undefined behavior).

Software Testing

The CRS is especially tuned for identifying memory safety violations. This class of
bug encompasses many common security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows,
use-after-free errors, stack overflows and heap overflows. Using the CRS, we were
unable to identify memory safety issues with the

Software Verification

Using TIS-Interpreter, clang, and human review, several instances of zlib relying on
undefined behavior were identified, when compiled with default settings. Relying on
undefined behavior has caused security issues in the past, and may result in bugs  5
in compiled zlib code in the future.

GCC optimization -fstrict-aliasing). In short, the strict aliasing rules mandate that
memory is read with the same type that was used to write it . 6

Optimizing compilers assume that the strict aliasing rules violated here are always
respected. They do not make an effort to detect violations of strict aliasing, and
hence do not warn about such violations. It does not matter if the reading and
writing of the buffer occurs inside or outside of the same function, or within
different compilation units; strict aliasing is still violated.

Current optimizing compilers will produce erroneous results, like different CRC32
values for the same memory contents, in
a toy example that violates strict aliasing

● If speed matters and non-standard GCC extensions in the source code

(recognized by clang) are acceptable, use the may_alias type attribute. This
would be a good opportunity to replace both the 4-at-a-time and the
32-at-a-time loops by a single 8-at-a-time loop that takes advantage of
modern 64-bit instruction sets.

● If speed matters and the C code must be portable, it can be built with the

-fno-strict-aliasing option when using the clang or gcc compilers.

● See one additional solution in

Appendix B

.

In the long term, platform-specific micro-optimizations should be deprecated. These
optimizations make the code more complex and may harbor latent bugs, such as
this one. Modern compilers are much better at optimizing and vectorizing code than
they used to be. Removing micro-optimizations will allow for simpler, more bug-free
code.

Finding 3: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c

Severity: Low
Type: Undefined Behavior

Description:
Zlib computes out-of-bounds pointers in several places, even though these pointers
are not dereferenced. Still, using pointer arithmetic in order to go out of the bounds
of the pointed block is forbidden by the C standard, and compiler optimizations
exist that assume code does not do this . 7

Places where out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic is used are shown below.

Alternate Solution for Finding 2

The Zlib development team pointed out that compilers would not be able to
vectorize and unroll that code if it were one loop, and that performance is critical.

If the proposed solution does not meet performance goals, and there is not a
simple way to both keep the manually unrolled loops and not use buf4, another
option would be to add -fno-strict-aliasing to build flags or the may_alias attribute to
buf4, for compilers that support such features.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2664876.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id= 2664876.1).

| [Description](#c0)  Mark Miller    2004-11-29 20:52:59 UTC  ``` I assume since xbattle hasn't been worked on since _1996_, they decided to take down the web page: <http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/xpip/html/xbattle.html>  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Look at the ebuild information for xbattle 2. 3.  Actual Results:   *  games-strategy/xbattle       Latest version available: 5.4.1       Latest version installed: [ Not Installed ]       Size of downloaded files: 125 kB       Homepage:    <http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/xpip/html/xbattle.html>       Description: A multi-player game of strategy and coordination       License:     xbattle   Expected Results:   I don't believe anyone is maintaining xbattle anymore. I believe xbattleai should be added instead into portage, this will be filed as a seperate bug. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-12-29 21:10:57 UTC  ``` switched out the official homepage with an unofficial one. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1402351#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-07 10:10:21 UTC  ```  There was a small optimization for PowerPCs to pre-increment a pointer when accessing a word, instead of post-incrementing. This required prefacing the loop with a decrement of the pointer, possibly pointing before the object passed. This is not compliant with the C standard, for which decrementing a pointer before its allocated memory is undefined. When tested on a modern PowerPC with a modern compiler, the optimization no longer has any effect.

Still, using pointer arithmetic in order to go out of the bounds of the pointed block is forbidden by the C standard, and compiler optimizations exist that assume code does not do this.  The places where this happens are listed in the report Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/6a043145ca6e9c55184013841a67b2fef87e44c0>  and <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9aaec95e82117c1cb0f9624264c3618fc380cecb> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-10-07 22:00:28 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c2)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-12-04 13:00:32 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1003579) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443701> Factory / zlib <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443702> 13.2 / zlib ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c3)  Tomáš Chvátal   2016-12-04 13:53:11 UTC  ``` all sumbissions done ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2016-12-06 10:25:04 UTC  ```     Finding 3: Out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic in inftrees.c (Low)       <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/6a043145ca6e9c55184013841a67b2fef87e44c0>   Use CVE-2016-9840.       <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/9aaec95e82117c1cb0f9624264c3618fc380cecb>   Use CVE-2016-9841. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c6)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-12-12 13:04:01 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1003579) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/445412> Factory / zlib <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/445413> 13.2 / zlib ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1003579#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-12-20 20:09:17 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:3202-1: An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-10-07 10:22:51 UTC  ``` Security audit of zlib: <https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/0/09/Zlib-report.pdf>  Upstream comments: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10i1KZS5so8xDqH2rplRa2xet0tyTvvJlLbQQmZIUIKE/edit#heading=h.t13tvnx4loq7>  Fixes: <https://github.com/madler/zlib> - you need to switch to 'develop'  Quoting from the report: The declaration and implementation of the deflate function use incompatible types. The first argument to deflate is of type zstreamp, which is a pointer to an internal structure that has a member of type struct internal_state. In a default compilation of zlib, struct internal_state is re-defined after the declaration of deflate.  Even though current compilers process this code without issues, this bug is rated severity medium for two reasons. First, the deflate function is used by virtually every application that includes zlib. Second, there is no telling what interactions the bug could have in the future with link-time optimizations and type-based alias analyses, both features that are present (but not default) in clang.  Source Reference (zlib.h): 1740 /* hack for buggy compilers */ 1741 #if !defined(ZUTIL_H) && !defined(NO_DUMMY_DECL) 1742 struct internal_state {int dummy;}; 1743 #endif  The reason this defect is not detected by ordinary compilation chains is that deflate is declared with incompatible types in different compilation units.  This results from a workaround for buggy compilers. Venturing a guess as to the origin of this wart, some ancient C compilers must have complained (wrongly) when ' struct internal_state; ' was used in a compilation unit without the list of members of the struct, and their respective types, being defined. If so, the comment is correct in calling the compilers buggy: this is one of the very few abstraction mechanisms in standard C, and it has been widely used as a result in plenty of other C code written since zlib. The buggy compilers, if they were still used, would choke on everything else apart from zlib  Recommendations: This bug should be fixed immediately by either removing support for buggy compilers, or by making NO_DUMMY_DECL a default compile-time option, thereby forcing buggy compilers to opt-in to workaround behavior.  In the longer term, support for old and buggy compilers should be deprecated. The result will be less code, fewer bugs, and a cleaner, easier-to-read and -audit codebase. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2016-10-07 10:24:31 UTC  ``` Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/3fb251b363866417122fe54a158a1ac5a7837101> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-10-07 22:00:16 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c3)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-12-04 13:00:22 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1003577) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443701> Factory / zlib <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443702> 13.2 / zlib ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c4)  Tomáš Chvátal   2016-12-04 13:53:26 UTC  ``` all sumbissions done ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c5)  Tomáš Chvátal   2016-12-04 13:56:59 UTC  ``` all sumbissions done ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2016-12-06 10:24:13 UTC  ``` From Mitre      Finding 1: Incompatible declarations for external linkage function deflate (Medium)     Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/3fb251b363866417122fe54a158a1ac5a7837101>   We feel that the scope of CVE should, ideally, omit unexploitable code-quality issues. The PDF report has a number of comments about Finding 1; however, one comment is "current compilers process this code without issues." A finding can be important to the practice of software development without being important for vulnerability management. For now, the answer is that there is no CVE ID. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c8)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-12-12 13:03:54 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1003577) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/445412> Factory / zlib <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/445413> 13.2 / zlib ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1003577#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-12-13 15:18:32 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1443052#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-18 11:54:42 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the HTTP client implementation in the Networking component of OpenJDK could cache a connection using NTLM authentication and later re-use it in a different security context where no or different authentication was meant to be used.  A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a Java application to perform HTTP requests authenticated with credentials of a different user.  The fix for this issue adds support for the "jdk.ntlm.cache" system property, which can be used to disable caching of NTLM authenticated connections when set to false.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1443052#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-18 18:29:46 UTC  ``` Relevant entry in the Oracle JDK release notes:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u131-relnotes-3565278.html> <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/documentation/javase7supportreleasenotes-1601161.html#R170_141> <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/overview-156328.html#R160_151>    core-libs/java.net   New system property to control caching for HTTP NTLM connection.    A new JDK implementation specific system property to control caching for   HTTP NTLM connection is introduced. Caching for HTTP NTLM connection remains   enabled by default, so if the property is not explicitly specified, there   will be no behavior change.    On some platforms, the HTTP NTLM implementation in the JDK can support   transparent authentication, where the system user credentials are used at   system level. When transparent authentication is not available or   unsuccessful, the JDK only supports getting credentials from a global   authenticator. If connection to the server is successful, the authentication   information will then be cached and reused for further connections to the   same server. In addition, connecting to an HTTP NTLM server usually involves   keeping the underlying connection alive and reusing it for further requests   to the same server. In some applications, it may be desirable to disable all   caching for the HTTP NTLM protocol in order to force requesting new   authentication with each new requests to the server.    With this change, we now provide a new system property that allows control   of the caching policy for HTTP NTLM connections. If jdk.ntlm.cache is   defined and evaluates to false, then all caching will be disabled for HTTP   NTLM connections. Setting this system property to false may, however,   result in undesirable side effects:    * Performance of HTTP NTLM connections may be severely impacted as the   connection will need to be re-authenticated with each new request,   requiring several communication exchanges with the server.    * Credentials will need to be obtained again for each new request, which,   depending on whether transparent authentication is available or not, and   depending on the global Authenticator implementation, may result in a popup   asking the user for credentials for every new request.    JDK-8163520 (not public)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1443052#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-18 22:18:30 UTC  ``` Public now via Oracle CPU April 20167, fixed in Oracle JDK 8u131, 7u141, and 6u151.

Hash: SHA512

Package        : zlib
Version        : 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9840 CVE-2016-9841 CVE-2016-9842 CVE-2016-9843

Several issues have been found in zlib, a compression library.

```
They are basically about improper big-endian CRC calculation, improper
left shift of negative integers and improper pointer arithmetic.
```

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.2.8.dfsg-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zlib packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-10-07 10:29:57 UTC  ``` Security audit of zlib: <https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/0/09/Zlib-report.pdf>  Upstream comments: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10i1KZS5so8xDqH2rplRa2xet0tyTvvJlLbQQmZIUIKE/edit#heading=h.t13tvnx4loq7>  Fixes: <https://github.com/madler/zlib> - you need to switch to 'develop'  Quoting from the report: While testing the possible fix of the strict aliasing issue ( ​ Finding 2 ​ ), we identified an invalid left shift of a negative number. Source Reference (inflate.c): 1507 if (strm == Z_NULL || strm->state == Z_NULL) return -1L << 16; Left shifts of negative value are undefined, but in practice this will probably continue to have the desired behavior. Recommendation: Change -1L << 16 to (~0xFFFFL). Potential sample code: 1507 if (strm == Z_NULL || strm->state == Z_NULL) return (~0xFFFFL);  Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/d1d577490c15a0c6862473d7576352a9f18ef811> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-10-07 22:00:38 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c2)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-12-04 13:00:37 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1003580) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443701> Factory / zlib <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/443702> 13.2 / zlib ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c3)  Tomáš Chvátal   2016-12-04 13:52:33 UTC  ``` all sumbissions done ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c4)  Tomáš Chvátal   2016-12-04 13:54:43 UTC  ``` all sumbissions done ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2016-12-06 10:26:10 UTC  ```      Finding 5: Big-endian out-of-bounds pointer (Low)     Fix: <https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/d1d577490c15a0c6862473d7576352a9f18ef811>   Use CVE-2016-9843. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c7)  Salvatore Bonaccorso   2016-12-06 20:58:01 UTC  ``` Hi Marcus  I think [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1003580#c6) should belong to another but, the one for CVE-2016-9843, i.e. <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1013882> ?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1443007#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-18 09:36:35 UTC  ``` A untrusted library search path flaw was found in the JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) component of OpenJDK, caused by a problem with the handling of paths to extension directories in the sun.misc.Launcher class.  A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause a Java application using JCE to load an attacker-controlled library and therefore escalate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1443007#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2017-04-18 22:17:39 UTC  ``` Public now via Oracle CPU April 20167, fixed in Oracle JDK 8u131 and 7u141.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* [zlib](/security/cves?package=zlib) - Lossless data-compression library

## Details

It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled pointer arithmetic. An attacker

could use this issue to cause zlib to crash, resulting in a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9840](/security/CVE-2016-9840), [CVE-2016-9841](/security/CVE-2016-9841))

It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled vectors involving left shifts of

negative integers. An attacker could use this issue to cause zlib to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-9842](/security/CVE-2016-9842))

It was discovered that zlib incorrectly handled vectors involving big-endian CRC

calculation. An attacker could use this issue to cause zlib to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-9843](/security/CVE-2016-9843))

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [rsync](/security/cves?package=rsync) - fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

## Details

It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled pointer arithmetic in zlib.

An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9840](/security/CVE-2016-9840),

[CVE-2016-9841](/security/CVE-2016-9841))

It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving left shifts

of negative integers in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2016-9842](/security/CVE-2016-9842))

It was discovered that rsync incorrectly handled vectors involving big-endian

CRC calculation in zlib. An attacker could use this issue to cause rsync to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-9843](/security/CVE-2016-9843))

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

### chrony

Dates: June - September 2017

[chrony](http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/) is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol, used either to set the time on a particular machine or act as an NTP server for other machines on the network. The audit was performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/), and kindly funded by [CII](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/).

The team found the following problems:

* 2 Low

Cure53 write: The overwhelmingly positive result of this security assignment performed by three Cure53 testers can be clearly inferred from a marginal number and low-risk nature of the findings amassed in this report. Withstanding eleven full days of on-remote testing in August of 2017 means that Chrony is robust, strong, and developed with security in mind. The software boasts sound design and is secure across all tested areas. It is quite safe to assume that untested software in the Chrony family is of a similarly exceptional quality. In general, the software proved to be well-structured and marked by the right abstractions at the appropriate locations. While the functional scope of the software is quite wide, the actual implementation is surprisingly elegant and of a minimal and just necessary complexity. In sum, the Chrony NTP software stands solid and can be seen as trustworthy.

The Cure53 team were extremely impressed with the quality of the dovecot code. They wrote: "Despite much effort and thoroughly all-encompassing approach, the Cure53 testers only managed to assert the excellent security-standing of Dovecot. More specifically, only three minor security issues have been found in the codebase, thus translating to an exceptionally good outcome for Dovecot, and a true testament to the fact that keeping security promises is at the core of the Dovecot development and operations."

## 2016

### PCRE

Dates: October 2015 - June 2016

[PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/) (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions) is a C library for implementing [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in a codebase. It is used in various open source projects including Exim, Apache, PHP and KDE, as well as Apple Safari. We audited PCRE2, a newer version which is currently less commonly-used but which is expected to become increasingly common. The audit was performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/).

The team found the following problems:

* 1 Critical
* 5 Medium
* 20 Low
* 3 Informational

The critical vulnerability was a stack buffer overflow which could have led to arbitrary code execution when compiling untrusted regular expressions.

### libjpeg-turbo

Dates: November 2015 - June 2016

[libjpeg-turbo](http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/) is a fork of the libjpeg codebase which is particularly focussed on speed, and on compatibility with the most commonly-used standard profiles of JPEG. It is used by a number of open source projects, including Chrome, LibreOffice, Firefox and various flavours of VNC. The audit was performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/).

The team found the following problems:

* 1 High
* 2 Medium
* 2 Low

The high vulnerability was an out-of-bounds read. It is unclear exactly how exploitable it was. However, more interesting were the two medium vulnerabilities, which were initially reported as DoS bugs in the libjpeg-turbo library but on further investigation were found to be issues with the JPEG standard itself. These issues were reproduced across multiple JPEG implementations, can be triggered by entirely legal JPEGs, and so are not easy to mitigate in any JPEG library itself. We have written up these issues in a separate report, along with our suggestions as to how applications using JPEG can mitigate them in their own code.

### dnsmasq

Dates: May - August 2016

[dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is a lightweight implementation of DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot. It is used in resource-constrained environments such as routers and firewalls (e.g. openWRT and DD-WRT), Android, and OpenStack. The audit was performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/).

The team found the following problems:

* 1 Medium
* 5 Low

* [Audit report](/images/f/f7/Dnsmasq-report.pdf "Dnsmasq-report.pdf")

### zlib

Dates: July - September 2016

[zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) is a compression library implementing the 'deflate' compression algorithm, used in countless applications. The audit was performed by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).

The team found the following problems:

* 1 Medium
* 4 Low

* [Audit report](/images/0/09/Zlib-report.pdf "Zlib-report.pdf")
* [Fix and validation log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10i1KZS5so8xDqH2rplRa2xet0tyTvvJlLbQQmZIUIKE/edit)

One of the Low severity issues is still under discussion between the zlib development team and the auditors, as they are working out how to resolve it without performance degradation.

### curl

Dates: August - November 2016

[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) is a command-line application for transferring data, most usually over HTTP or HTTPS. The audit was performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/).

The team found the following problems:

* 4 High
* 5 Medium
* 9 Low
* 5 Informational

8 of the vulnerabilities resulted in [security advisories](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html) being produced by the curl team on November 2nd, 2016.

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

* [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)
* [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Avoid pre-decrement of pointer in big-endian CRC calculation.

```
There was a small optimization for PowerPCs to pre-increment a
pointer when accessing a word, instead of post-incrementing. This
required prefacing the loop with a decrement of the pointer,
possibly pointing before the object passed. This is not compliant
with the C standard, for which decrementing a pointer before its
allocated memory is undefined. When tested on a modern PowerPC
with a modern compiler, the optimization no longer has any effect.
Due to all that, and per the recommendation of a security audit of
the zlib code by Trail of Bits and TrustInSoft, in support of the
Mozilla Foundation, this "optimization" was removed, in order to
avoid the possibility of undefined behavior.
```
