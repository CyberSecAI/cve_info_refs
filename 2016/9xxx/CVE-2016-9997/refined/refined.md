Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit message "Fix #3845 : sécuriser les exec info_plugin et puce_statut" indicates a security fix for the `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` functions. The mention of "sécuriser" (secure) implies that these functions had vulnerabilities prior to this commit. The message also credits "felixk3y de PKAV Team" for reporting the issue. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The functions `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` were vulnerable.  The details about what kind of vulnerability are not provided in this commit message alone.  Based on the term "sécuriser" it's likely that they were susceptible to some kind of injection or had inadequate sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The commit message does not directly state the impact of the vulnerabilities. However, given the context of a security fix, a potential impact could have included:
*   Information disclosure by manipulating the `info_plugin` function.
*   Remote code execution using the `puce_statut` or using a vulnerability in `info_plugin` to execute code.
*   Ability to modify system functionality or gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

The provided text does not give the details for attack vectors. However, the functions `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` were likely accessible via a web interface or API, and could have been vulnerable through user-supplied input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would have needed to interact with the vulnerable functions.  This could be possible for any web user or possibly an authenticated user, depending on the access control surrounding these functions.

**Summary:**
This commit fixes vulnerabilities in the `info_plugin` and `puce_statut` functions, likely related to unsanitized input, which could have led to information disclosure or remote code execution. The details of the specific vulnerability and attack vector are not revealed in the commit message but the message indicates they were serious enough to warrant a security fix.
