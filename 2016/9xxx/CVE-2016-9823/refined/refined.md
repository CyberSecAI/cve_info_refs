Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds access in the `mpegvideo.c` file within the libav library, specifically when accessing a `uint8_t` array of size 64. The code attempts to access an index of -1, resulting in a read out of the array bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the use of a negative index (-1) to access a `uint8_t` array, which is a buffer overflow read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash, as indicated by the "runtime error: index -1 out of bounds" message.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information only mentions a crash, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be leveraged to leak sensitive information or, in more complex scenarios, be used as a stepping stone for further exploitation. However, this is not confirmed in the provided information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Media File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted media file. The provided test case, available on GitHub, shows the input required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **avconv:** The `avconv` command-line tool is used to process the malicious file, indicating it's a typical attack vector to exploit libav through a user opening a malicious file or a server processing a user-submitted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply a malicious media file:** An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable libav software with the crafted malicious media file. This could be through tricking a user into opening a file, uploading to a vulnerable server, etc.
- **No special permissions needed:** The attack doesn't seem to require any special privileges, as the crash is triggered when processing the file by the program.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Version:** libav version 11.8 is affected.
- **File and Location:** The vulnerability is located in `/libavcodec/x86/mpegvideo.c` at line 53, column 18.
- **Undefined Behavior Sanitizer:** The vulnerability was found using the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer, indicating that it's undefined behavior related to an out of bounds access.
- **Test Case:** The test case (`00038-libav-uint8_t64-outofbounds-mpegvideo`) is available on GitHub which provides a way to reproduce the issue.

In summary, CVE-2016-9823 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libav that can be triggered by a malicious media file, causing a crash.
