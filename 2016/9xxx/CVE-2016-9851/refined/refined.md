Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass the logout timeout mechanism in phpMyAdmin by crafting a specific request parameter value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Session Management:** The core weakness is in how phpMyAdmin handles session timeouts, allowing an attacker to manipulate parameters and effectively prevent the session from expiring. This suggests a flaw in the logic that controls session expiration and logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- By bypassing the logout timeout, an attacker can maintain an active session, potentially accessing sensitive information and performing actions within the phpMyAdmin interface. This would allow the attacker to potentially make changes to a database without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP request parameters. This indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the web.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the phpMyAdmin instance. No additional special privileges or network positions are explicitly mentioned in the description, suggesting the attack could be launched remotely by anyone who can access the phpMyAdmin instance.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.x (prior to 4.6.5) and 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.9).
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-661 ("Improper Handling of Session Timeout").
- The fix involves upgrading to phpMyAdmin version 4.6.5, 4.4.15.9, or applying provided patches.
