Reflected XSS
-------------

The HackerOne user pavanw3b has reported that the Revive Adserver web
installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost,
dbUser and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window
for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very
unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.

CWE: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 4 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
CVSSv3 Base Score: 4.2
CVSSv3 Temporal Score: 3.7

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2016-002

## Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2016-002

* Advisory ID: [REVIVE-SA-2016-002](https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-002/)
* CVE-IDs: See below
* Date: 2016-09-28
* Risk Level: Medium
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 3.2.4
* Versions not affected: >= 3.2.5, >= 4.0.0
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 – Reflected file download

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9470](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9470)
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
* CVSSv3 Vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

### Description

## Vulnerability 2 – Special Element Injection

* CVE-ID: [CVE-2016-9471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9471)
* CWE-ID: CWE-75
* CVSSv2: 2.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)
* CVSSv3 Vector CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
* CVSSv3 Base Score: 3.1
* CVSSv3 Temporal Score: 2.7

### Description

Joel Noguera has reported via HackerOne that usernames weren’t properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.

Reflected XSS
-------------

The HackerOne user pavanw3b has reported that the Revive Adserver web
installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost,
dbUser and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window
for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very
unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective.

CWE: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 4 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
CVSSv3 Base Score: 4.2
CVSSv3 Temporal Score: 3.7

Special Element Injection
-------------------------

Joel Noguera has reported via HackerOne that usernames weren't properly
sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially,
control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical
usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters
are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser.
The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although
elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.
