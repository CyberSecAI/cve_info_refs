Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incomplete initialization or clearing of reused memory in OpenAFS directory objects. This leads to "dead" directory entry information being present in various locations. Specifically:

1.  **Partial Name Data:** When a directory entry is reused for a shorter name, residual data from the previous (longer) name remains after the null terminator.
2.  **Uncleared Dead Entries:**  After a directory object is deleted or renamed, the directory entries are not cleared.
3.  **Residual Entries in New/Extended Directories:** The fileserver reuses a buffer pool for directories across all AFS users, but doesn't clear buffers before reuse. This causes residual data from other directories to appear when a new directory is created or an existing one is extended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The core weakness is the exposure of directory information that should not be accessible. This leaked data includes names of files/directories, FIDs (File Identifiers), vnodes (virtual node numbers), and unique IDs.
*   **Inadequate Memory Management:** The reuse of memory without proper clearing allows data from previous operations to persist.
*   **Lack of Data Sanitization:**  The failure to zero out or overwrite memory buffers before reuse introduces the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Passive Information Gathering:** Users authorized to read directories could capture network traffic or examine local cache to gather leaked directory information during normal read operations.
*   **Active Information Gathering:** Users authorized to create new directories can create and flush/read them to repeatedly sample current fileserver directory buffer contents without detection. This allows continuous sampling of directory buffer contents.
*   **Data Inference:** By examining the leaked vnode and unique IDs, an attacker could:
    *   Identify layers of old directories.
    *   Infer which objects are on the same volume.
    *   Determine the order in which objects were created or modified.
    *   Distinguish between files and directories.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** The leaked information could reveal sensitive directory structures and file names, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized knowledge of the system and potentially aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** Capturing unencrypted OpenAFS network traffic.
*   **Fileserver Vice Partition Access:** Direct access to the storage on a fileserver.
*   **Cache Manager Cache Partition Access:** Examining the contents of a client's cache.
*   **Authorized Reads:** Performing authorized read operations on existing directories.
*   **Directory Creation/Extension:** Creating new directories or extending existing ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access (for sniffing):** Ability to monitor network traffic if unencrypted
*   **File System Access:** Direct access to fileserver vice partitions, client cache partitions.
*   **OpenAFS User Access:** Need to be an authorized AFS user to perform reads or create directories
*   **Privilege:** The attacker does not require special privileges if they are an authorized AFS user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the leaked information can propagate through multiple layers as new directories are created.
*   The fixes involve clearing directory entries upon deletion, clearing internal directory buffers before reuse.
*   A salvage operation with the `-salvagedirs` option is recommended to remove existing leaks after patching.
*   The vulnerability is present in all OpenAFS versions prior to 1.6.20 (Unix).

The provided diffs show the following fixes:
  * Clearing the buffer data before reuse in `afs_newslot` (src/afs/afs_buffer.c), `newslot` (src/dir/buffer.c), and `DNew` (src/dir/buffer.c).
  * Clearing the entire directory entry including extension in `Delete` (src/dir/dir.c) and `afs_dir_Delete` (src/dir/dir.c).
  * Added support for `-salvagedirs` to the `bos salvage` command, and for the `salvage` command in `salvaged.c`

The vulnerability allows a user to observe other user's directory information by creating, extending or simply reading directories on the same fileserver.
