Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9318:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from libxml2's improper handling of external entities in XML files, specifically parameter entities when validating DTD. When processing XML files, libxml2 by default attempts to resolve and load external entities which can be abused to include remote files or perform local file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the possibility of XXE attacks, where a specially crafted XML document can force libxml2 to load external resources (files, URLs) specified in the XML. This can lead to various security issues.
- Inadequate control over external entity loading: libxml2 does not provide an adequate way to prevent the loading of external entities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially expose sensitive information from the local file system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By forcing the parser to resolve a large number of external entities, an attacker could exhaust system resources and cause a denial of service.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could potentially force the server to make requests to internal or external resources which the attacker would not normally have access to, resulting in SSRF.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** In some cases, could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through processing of a malicious XML file that has been crafted with external entity references.
- The victim is the application that uses libxml2 to parse the malicious XML.
- The attacker provides the specially crafted XML file to the vulnerable application which in turn uses libxml2.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file to a vulnerable application that uses libxml2.
-  The attacker needs to know the location of the resources they want to retrieve, or host their own server with the malicious resource.
- The attacker does not need a foothold on the victim machine.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was initially discovered in the xmlsec library, which uses libxml2 for XML parsing.
- The initial patches attempted to address the problem at a specific layer of processing, but a more comprehensive approach involved adding a new flag `XML_PARSE_NOXXE` which could be used to explicitly prevent the loading of external entities.
- It was noted that the `--postvalid` option in `xmllint` required loading the DTD and was incompatible with `--noent`, which prevents external entity loading.
- The patch uses a new flag to limit the parser to only process the current file and disallow any external files or network access.

- The vulnerability was fixed in `libxml2` version `2.9.8`.
