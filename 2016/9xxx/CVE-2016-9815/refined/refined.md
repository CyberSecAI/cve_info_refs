Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-9815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The hypervisor on ARM systems does not properly handle asynchronous aborts (SError on ARMv8) triggered by a guest. Specifically, when a guest accesses memory-mapped hardware in a non-conventional way, the hypervisor might receive an asynchronous abort.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Handling of Guest-Triggered Aborts**: The Xen hypervisor's default response to an asynchronous abort from a guest was to crash the entire host system, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious guest can intentionally trigger an asynchronous abort, causing the Xen hypervisor to crash and resulting in a denial of service for the entire host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A guest can trigger an asynchronous abort by accessing memory-mapped hardware in a non-conventional way. This can be achieved even if device pass-through has not been explicitly configured, as the hypervisor might grant the guest access to some memory-mapped hardware for virtualization purposes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system within the Xen hypervisor. They need the ability to execute code within the guest OS that can access memory-mapped hardware in a way that triggers the asynchronous abort.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects all Xen versions that support ARM. x86 systems are not affected.
*   The fix involves crashing the guest instead of the host when such an abort occurs.
*   The vulnerability was publicly known and fixed in KVM before the Xen fix was released.
