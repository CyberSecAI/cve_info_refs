{
  "CVE-2016-9243": {
    "description": "The python-cryptography library incorrectly handled certain HKDF lengths, potentially returning an empty string instead of the expected derived key.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error in the HKDF expand function where the loop condition was incorrectly calculated, causing it to terminate prematurely when a requested key length was less than the digest size, leading to empty output.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect length handling in the HKDF implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could result in a cryptographic operation failing silently, leading to an empty or incorrect key being used. This can lead to authentication bypass, or other cryptographic failures.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specifically crafted inputs to the HKDF derive function with short lengths."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the parameters of the HKDF call, specifically the length of the derived key.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability resides in the `_expand` function within `src/cryptography/hazmat/primitives/kdf/hkdf.py`. The incorrect loop condition is `while (self._algorithm.digest_size // 8) * len(output) < self._length:`. The fix replaces it with `while self._algorithm.digest_size * (len(output) - 1) < self._length:`. The fix ensures that output is generated until the desired length is reached, even if it is less than a single hash digest."
