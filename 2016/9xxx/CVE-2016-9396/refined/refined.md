  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for the condition `qmfbid == JPC_COX_RFT` in the JPC_NOMINALGAIN function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A reachable assertion abort in the JPC_NOMINALGAIN function due to an invalid `qmfbid` value.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote denial of service (DoS) attack can be triggered due to the assertion failure, causing the application to abort.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file to the affected application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG 2000 file, but does not need any authentication or special position. The attack can be executed remotely if the application processes untrusted user-supplied input."
