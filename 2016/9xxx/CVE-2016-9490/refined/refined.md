Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization of the `LIMIT` parameter in the URL path `/DiagAlertAction.do?REQTYPE=AJAX&LIMIT=1233` within ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the unsanitized `LIMIT` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter.
- When a user clicks on a crafted link, the malicious code executes within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable application.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Phishing attacks by redirecting to a malicious site or displaying a fake login form.
    - Defacing the application.
    - Other malicious activities within the scope of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `LIMIT` parameter.
- The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking on the crafted link, typically through social engineering tactics.
- The URL path `/DiagAlertAction.do?REQTYPE=AJAX&LIMIT=1233` is accessible without authentication, increasing the attack surface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- They need the ability to send the crafted URL to a potential victim.
- The attacker can be an external user with no prior access to the application.
