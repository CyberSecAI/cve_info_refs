Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles HTTP redirects to `data:` URLs, specifically in the context of image loading (e.g., via the `<img>` tag) and object loading (e.g., via the `<object>` tag). When a resource (like an SVG image) is loaded via an HTTP redirect to a `data:` URL, the resulting document incorrectly inherits the principal (security context, including origin) of the referring site instead of receiving a null principal. This inheritance is due to the `SEC_ALLOW_CROSS_ORIGIN_DATA_INHERITS` flag being applied even after the redirect, which it should not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Principal Inheritance:** The core issue is that `data:` URLs loaded after an HTTP redirect inherit the principal of the initial document, rather than getting a null principal. This behavior was introduced in Firefox 49 with changes related to `nsILoadInfo` and `AsyncOpen2`.
2.  **Cross-Origin Cookie Setting:** Because of the incorrect principal, an attacker-controlled SVG image loaded via this redirect can set cookies for the domain of the original page, violating the Same-Origin Policy (SOP). This is possible because the `Set-Cookie` directive within the SVG is executed under the origin of the page displaying the image.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `<object>`:** A similar vulnerability exists with `<object>` tags. An attacker can redirect a cross-site `<object>` load to a data:text/html URL, which then executes arbitrary script in the security context (principal) of the page loading the object, achieving cross-site scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Cookie Setting:** Attackers can set arbitrary cookies for a victim domain. While the specific example shows the ability to set cookies, but not read them, this still creates an opportunity for abuse.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the security context of the victim's website is a much more severe issue and enables the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Image Loading:** An attacker hosts a malicious SVG or other image which redirects to a `data:` URL containing an SVG document with a `Set-Cookie` meta tag or other similar code. A victim website includes an `<img>` tag referencing the attacker's image, triggering the vulnerability.
2.  **Object Loading:** An attacker hosts an HTML document that redirects to a data:text/html URL containing malicious javascript. A victim website includes an `<object>` tag referencing the attacker's document, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Malicious Resource:** The attacker needs to control a server that can host a resource (SVG image, HTML document) and send HTTP redirects.
*   **Victim Website Including External Content:** The victim website must include content from external sources (using `<img>`, `<object>`) or use open redirectors.
*   **Firefox 49 & 50:** The vulnerability is specific to Firefox versions 49 and 50.

**Additional Notes from the provided bugzilla information:**

*   The vulnerability is considered critical because of the potential for XSS and the ability to set arbitrary cookies.
*   The issue was introduced by changes related to `nsILoadInfo` and `AsyncOpen2` and specifically [bug 1206961](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1206961) which enabled the use of `AsyncOpen2` in image loading.
*   The fix was to prevent the inheritance of the principal for data: URLs after redirects by adding a check in `nsScriptSecurityManager::GetChannelResultPrincipal`
*   The `SEC_ALLOW_CROSS_ORIGIN_DATA_INHERITS` flag, which causes the inheritance, should only apply for initial loads, not for loads that have been redirected.
*   The `SEC_ALLOW_CROSS_ORIGIN_DATA_IS_NULL` flag was not set for redirected data: resources before this bug.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox 50.0.1.
*   The fix also addressed a separate issue where `<object>` tags could be used to trigger an XSS when a redirect to a `data:` URI occurs. This was introduced in Firefox 50 with [bug 1188642](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188642)
