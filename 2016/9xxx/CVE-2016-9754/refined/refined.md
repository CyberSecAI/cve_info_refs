{
  "CVE-2016-9754": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An integer overflow in the `ring_buffer_resize()` function when calculating the number of pages needed for a ring buffer. This occurs due to multiple `DIV_ROUND_UP` operations and a multiplication by `BUF_PAGE_SIZE`, which can result in a small or zero value for the number of pages, leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Incorrect calculation of buffer size"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Kernel crash due to invalid number of pages being calculated and used.",
    "Attack vectors": "Writing a very large value to `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb`",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with write access to the debugfs tracing interface."
  }
