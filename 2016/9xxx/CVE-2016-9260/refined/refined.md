Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-9260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that arises from how Nessus handles `.nessus` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data within `.nessus` files, allowing the injection of arbitrary code into the web browser when users interact with the scan results through Nessus web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a user interacting with the Nessus web interface. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement or further compromising the system the user is logged into.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the upload or processing of a maliciously crafted `.nessus` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Nessus system with the ability to upload or trigger the processing of `.nessus` files.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was privately reported by Noriaki Iwasaki of Cyber Defense Institute, Inc.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Nessus version 6.9.
- The content suggests that successful exploitation would require user interaction, but this might be a misinterpretation as a stored XSS typically doesn't require active user interaction after initial injection of the payload.
