Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `update_cursor_data_virgl` function within the QEMU emulator's virtio-gpu device emulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: When updating cursor data, if the new cursor width or height does not match the current cursor's dimensions, the function returns without freeing the previously allocated memory for 'data', causing a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A guest user or process can exploit this vulnerability to repeatedly trigger the memory leak. By doing so, they can consume host memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious guest user or process by repeatedly requesting updates to the cursor data with different width/height values that are different than the current one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged user or process within the QEMU guest environment. This means they must have the ability to interact with the emulated hardware and trigger cursor update operations.
