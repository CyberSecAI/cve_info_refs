{
  "CVE-2016-9793": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of setsockopt for the SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE setsockopt() system call. Users with non-namespace CAP_NET_ADMIN are able to trigger this call and create a situation in which the sockets sendbuff data size could be negative. This could adversely affect memory allocations and create situations where the system could crash or cause memory corruption.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's implementation of setsockopt for the SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE setsockopt() system call allows users with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to set negative values for send buffer (sk_sndbuf) or receive buffer (sk_rcvbuf) sizes, which leads to memory corruption issues.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation in the handling of SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE socket options.",
       "Signed integer overflow vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to memory corruption, system crashes, or denial of service. A negative send/receive buffer can affect memory allocations and create a situation where the system could crash or cause memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use the setsockopt() system call with SO_{SND|RCV}BUFFORCE options to set negative buffer sizes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.",
    "Additional Details": "The issue existed because the kernel did not properly validate the value passed to setsockopt(), allowing a signed integer overflow that resulted in a negative size value for the socket buffer. Additionally, older kernels were vulnerable through SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF before the fix in commit `82981930125abfd39d7c8378a9cfdf5e1be2002b`."
