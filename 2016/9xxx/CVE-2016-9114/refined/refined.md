Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `imagetopnm` function within the `convert.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. Specifically, the `image->comps[compno].data` pointer is NULL, leading to a segmentation fault when the code attempts to access `*red` which is assigned the value of `image->comps[compno].data`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code doesn't validate the `image->comps[compno].data` pointer before dereferencing it. If this pointer is NULL, the program crashes with a segmentation fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application (opj_decompress) due to the segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file (likely a jp2 file). The content suggests the issue is in how the image data is handled during conversion of a JP2 image to PNM format. The specific details of the malformed JP2 input file are not detailed in the content provided but the user offers to provide the file for POC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a malicious JP2 file:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JP2 input file which triggers the null pointer dereference during processing by the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, it includes:
    - Specific function and line number where the crash occurs (`convert.c:1943`).
    - Address Sanitizer output showing the segmentation fault.
    - GDB output illustrating that the `image->comps[compno].data` pointer is indeed NULL.
    - Analysis explaining the root cause of the crash.
    - Indication of the vulnerable `opj_decompress` tool.
    - Version information `OPENJPEG-2.1.2` which is vulnerable.
