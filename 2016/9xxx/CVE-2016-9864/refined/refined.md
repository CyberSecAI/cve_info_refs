Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the tracking functionality of phpMyAdmin. Specifically, a crafted username or table name can be used to inject SQL statements into queries that are executed by the control user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-661):** This is another weakness, as the software does not correctly validate or sanitize the input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Read and write access to the tables of the configuration storage database:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration data or modify it.
- **Read access to some tables of the mysql database (if the control user has the necessary privileges):** The attacker could potentially gain access to core mysql database information if the control user has sufficient privileges.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The Gentoo security advisory mentions that the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities including this one could lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted username:** A malicious username designed to include SQL injection code.
- **Crafted table name:** A malicious table name designed to include SQL injection code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The vulnerability affects the tracking functionality which is accessed after authentication.
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests to the phpMyAdmin instance.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Emanuel Bronshtein (@e3amn2l).
- The issue was patched in phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.5, 4.4.15.9, 4.0.10.18, and later versions.
- The vulnerability is considered "serious".
- Patches are provided as commits for different branches (4.0, 4.4, and 4.6).
