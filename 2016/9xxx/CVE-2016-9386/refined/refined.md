Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Xen x86 emulator incorrectly handles null segment selectors during memory access operations.
-  Specifically, it fails to properly recognize and enforce the "unusable" state of null segments.
- On Intel hardware, loading a null selector sets the base to zero, but the limit to the maximum value. On AMD hardware, it sets the attributes to zero, but leaves base and limit unchanged. Xen incorrectly uses these unexpected base/limit values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Segment Handling:** Xen's emulator does not consistently treat null segment selectors as unusable, potentially leading to unintended memory accesses.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** The behavior differs between Intel and AMD hardware when loading null selectors. Xen's emulator does not correctly account for these differences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged guest user program can potentially elevate its privileges to that of the guest operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exposed to HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests.
- A malicious guest user program can attempt to exploit the incorrect handling of null segment selectors to perform unauthorized memory access, leading to privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user within a guest virtual machine.
-  The attacker must be able to manipulate segment selectors to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in all versions of Xen, but it's more easily exploited on Intel than on AMD (on AMD, it depends on LDT management by the guest kernel).
- The issue is mitigated in Xen 4.7 (unless explicitly configured with a non-default cpu vendor string), and fixed in later versions with a patch.
- ARM systems are not affected.
