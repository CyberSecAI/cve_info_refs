```
{
  "Root cause": "A signedness issue in the Linux kernel's IPv6 netfilter defragmentation code. During reassembly, the network header offset was assumed to be prior to the fragment in memory. In some situations, the header may be reconstructed in the assumed location and overwrite kernel memory.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Signedness issue during IPv6 packet defragmentation",
     "Incorrect handling of errors during IPv6 reassembly by netfilter, leading to the original, potentially malformed fragment being passed along."
  ],
  "Impact": "Kernel memory corruption, potentially leading to a system crash. Privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although considered unlikely.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted fragmented IPv6 packets sent over the network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the network and be able to send crafted IPv6 packets to the target system."
