Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9178:

**1. Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `get_user_ex()` macro in `arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h` does not properly initialize the destination variable (`x`) in case of failure. Specifically, if the memory access fails, the value of `x` remains uninitialized instead of being zeroed.
*   **Weakness:** Information Leak. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the uninitialized value on the kernel stack can be leaked to user space when the `get_user_ex` operation fails.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read uninitialized data from the kernel stack, which might contain sensitive information. This could aid in further exploitation of the system. The leaked value is a 64-bit value.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local user-space process that can call `get_user_ex()` with an address that will cause a fault can trigger the leak.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system.

**2. Technical Details:**

*   The `__get_user_asm_ex` macro is used to implement the `get_user_ex` functionality on x86 architecture.
*   The vulnerability exists within the `asm volatile` block, where the destination variable `x` isn't cleared on a memory access fault.
*   The fix involves adding instructions to the `asm volatile` block to XOR the destination register with itself (`xor"itype" %"rtype"0,%"rtype"0`) before jumping to the error handler (`jmp 2b`), thus zeroing `x`.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "minor" and is described as a "fairly constrained situation."
*   The leaked information is at most an uninitialized 64-bit value from the kernel stack.
*   The fix is described as "trivial."
*   The vulnerability is related to a larger set of fixes related to the `copy_from_user()` and `get_user()` primitives across multiple architectures.
*   There is a discussion mentioning that this is an instance of a "silent fix", as the fix is not accompanied by appropriate disclosure, which can be an issue.

**4. Patches and Fixes:**

*   The patch that fixes this vulnerability is available in the Linux kernel commit [1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af).
*   The fix was included in Linux Kernel 4.7.5
*   The patch modifies `arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h`.

**5. Red Hat Bugzilla and related info:**

* Red Hat acknowledges the vulnerability, tracked as bug [1391908](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1391908).
* Red Hat states that RHEL 5 is not affected, and RHEL 6 and 7 are affected with low severity, not planning to fix it.

In summary, CVE-2016-9178 is a minor information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `get_user_ex()` macro on x86 platforms that can allow local users to potentially obtain sensitive data from the kernel stack. The fix is small and straightforward, but the lack of proper disclosure is noted as an issue.
