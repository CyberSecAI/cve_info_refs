Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the web framework code of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This type of vulnerability occurs when an application includes user-provided data in the output it generates without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can conduct an XSS attack against users of the web interface.
*   The impact is related to the compromise of the integrity of the user's session with the application since the injected script can read cookies or perform actions in the user's name within the vulnerable web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   The attack complexity is medium (AC:M), suggesting that some specialized access conditions or steps are required to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
*   Authentication is not required (Au:N), allowing an unauthenticated attacker to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable web interface.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in or have prior access to the system.

**Additional Information:**
*   The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 4.3, with a temporal score of 3.6.
*   No workarounds were available at the time of the advisory.
*   There was no public information or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   Cisco has provided a fix for this vulnerability in a software update.
