Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Accellion FTP server exhibits an information exposure vulnerability in its API. When an invalid username is provided, the server returns the username in the response. However, when a valid username is provided, no response is returned, thereby allowing an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-204: Response Discrepancy Information Exposure:** The server's inconsistent response behavior for valid and invalid usernames leaks information, enabling username enumeration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can enumerate valid user accounts on the Accellion FTP server. This information can be used for further attacks, like password guessing or social engineering.
* If the FTP server is linked with LDAP credentials, the attacker may enumerate valid LDAP users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker can send POST requests with arbitrary usernames to the `/courier/isInvalidRecipient.api` endpoint. The server's response will reveal whether the username is valid or not.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Accellion FTP server.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials.
