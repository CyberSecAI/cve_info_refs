{
  "CVE-2016-9910": {
    "Root cause": "The html5lib serializer was not properly quoting attribute values that contained specific characters, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities in older browsers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper output sanitization",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages by crafting HTML attributes with unescaped special characters that are not properly handled by older browsers. When a victim views the page in a vulnerable browser, the injected script would execute, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft HTML content with specific characters in the attribute values that are not properly quoted by html5lib when using the serializer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the HTML content that is processed by html5lib and then displayed in a vulnerable browser."
