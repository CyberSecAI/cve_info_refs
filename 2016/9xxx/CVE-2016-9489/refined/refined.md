Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9489:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization controls within ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authorization bypass:** An authenticated user can modify their own user properties, including their group membership, allowing them to escalate their privileges to "ADMIN" or other higher privileged groups.
- **Privilege escalation:** By changing their group, a user can gain administrative or other elevated privileges, which they shouldn't have based on their initial access level.
- **User impersonation**: An authenticated user can modify the properties of other users, such as changing their passwords, potentially allowing them to take over other accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with valid, low-privilege user credentials can escalate their privileges to administrator level.
- An attacker can modify other user's passwords, effectively taking over their accounts.
- An attacker can gain full control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's web interface. An attacker must have valid, albeit low-privilege, user credentials for the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account with access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager web interface.
- No other special position is required.
