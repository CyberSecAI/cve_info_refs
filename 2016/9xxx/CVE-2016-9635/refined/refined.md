Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `flx_decode_delta_fli` function in the GStreamer FLIC decoder. Specifically, it's caused by a lack of bounds checking when handling delta frames.
*   The function uses values read from the input data (`data`) to calculate a destination address (`dest`) for the pixel data. These values, particularly the "skip count", "start_line", and the RLE "count" are not validated against the size of the output canvas. This allows an attacker to manipulate those values and achieve out-of-bounds writes.
*   This vulnerability can occur via several paths such as setting the `start_line` to be larger than the number of lines in the output canvas, or by specifying a skip count or a write count that exceeds the bounds of the last line.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The core weakness is a heap buffer overflow, where the decoder writes data outside the allocated memory region for the output buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The decoder does not validate input data to ensure it's within the expected boundaries of the output canvas or buffer.
*   **Relative Writes:** The initial out-of-bounds writes are relative to the allocated output buffer (`flxdec->frame_data`), offering some control to the attacker on which heap area to corrupt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting a malicious FLIC file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution. This is made possible through chain of techniques including partial pointer overwrite within thread heap, corruption of function pointers, and ultimately by corrupting the `__free_hook` glibc variable to trigger execution of arbitrary shell commands
*   **Application Crash/Denial of Service:** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, exploiting this vulnerability can easily lead to a crash due to memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Media File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted FLIC (or FLI/FLX) media file.
*   **User-Assisted Execution:** The attacker would need to entice the victim to open the malicious file using an application that utilizes GStreamer (e.g., a media player, file browser etc.).
*   **Drive-by Download:** The vulnerability can be further exploited as part of a drive-by download attack, particularly if media file indexing or thumbnailing is performed by an unsandboxed process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious FLIC Files:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted FLIC (or FLI/FLX) file that triggers the overflow vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must have a way to trick the victim into processing the malicious FLIC file, typically by opening it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `FLX_LC` command within the FLIC file.
*   A number of other GStreamer vulnerabilities also stem from this issue (CVE-2016-9634, CVE-2016-9636, CVE-2016-9807, CVE-2016-9808).
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple GStreamer versions, and affects multiple Linux distributions.
*   The exploit is complex, requiring chaining multiple memory read, write, and even addition primitives within the decoder loop.

This detailed analysis shows that CVE-2016-9635 involves a critical flaw in the gstreamer library, allowing for a sophisticated heap overflow with a high impact potential.
