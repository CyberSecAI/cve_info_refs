Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding the commit and its relation to a potential SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message explicitly states "fix sql injection issue in notfound controller; reported by pang0lin". This indicates that the `notfoundController.php` file was vulnerable to SQL injection before this commit. The vulnerability was located in the handling of search terms within the `page_not_found` function of the `notfoundController.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The original code was vulnerable to SQL injection through the `$terms` variable. This is likely due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in a database query. The provided diff shows the line `$terms = expString::escape(htmlspecialchars($terms));` which appears to be the fix where the input `$terms` is being escaped.
- It is not explicitly stated where or how the `$terms` variable is used to cause a SQL injection vulnerability but the fact that `expString::escape` was added to the `$terms` variable means that this variable likely was used in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `$terms` parameter.
- This could lead to various impacts including data exfiltration, data modification, or even complete compromise of the application and the underlying database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `$terms` parameter passed to the `page_not_found` function, which seems to be derived from user input via a search.
- An attacker would craft a malicious input string containing SQL code that is passed to the search functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `page_not_found` function, which is likely done through a search feature or by directly manipulating the URL to cause the 404 handler to execute.

**Additional Information**
- The patch modifies the `page_not_found` function by adding an escape function `expString::escape()` to the `$terms` variable.
- The commit also includes a `htmlspecialchars()` function, which would help prevent XSS as well, however, based on the commit message, the primary intention was to address the SQL injection vulnerability.
