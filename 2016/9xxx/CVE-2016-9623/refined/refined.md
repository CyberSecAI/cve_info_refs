Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2016-9623**

*   **Root Cause:** A negative size is passed to `Strnew_size`, which leads to a crash when trying to allocate a string of negative size. The negative size is the result of a calculation involving `LUsolve` and is used as the `width` variable when calling `Strnew_size`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Integer handling leading to a negative value being used as size for memory allocation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Crash/Denial of Service due to an attempt to allocate a negative-sized string which results in a segmentation fault due to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted HTML input can trigger the vulnerable code path via `LUsolve`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted HTML document.

**CVE-2016-9622**

*   **Root Cause:** A null pointer dereference occurs in `HTMLlineproc2body` when accessing `a_select[n_select]->url` because `a_select` is `NULL`. This occurs when parsing a crafted HTML file with a nested table, list, and select element.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of null pointers when processing HTML select elements within a list and table.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Crash/Denial of Service due to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted HTML input.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted HTML document.

**CVE-2016-9621**

*   **Root Cause:** A global buffer overflow occurs in the `formUpdateBuffer` function due to an out-of-bounds write. The `spos` variable, used as an index into `buf->currentLine->lineBuf`, is calculated such that it goes beyond the allocated buffer.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper bounds check when writing to the buffer within `formUpdateBuffer`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Global buffer overflow that can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted HTML input with form elements designed to trigger the overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted HTML document.

**CVE-2016-9624**

*   **Root Cause:** A near-null pointer dereference occurs in `formUpdateBuffer` because `buf->currentLine` is `NULL`. This occurs when processing a specific HTML file involving tables, nobr and select elements.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of null `currentLine` pointer within buffer when processing HTML forms.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Crash/Denial of Service due to a near-null pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted HTML input.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted HTML document.

**CVE-2016-9625**

*   **Root Cause:** An infinite recursion in `HTMLlineproc0` leading to a stack overflow.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Recursive call without proper exit condition
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Crash/Denial of Service due to a stack overflow.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted HTML input with a structure that causes infinite recursion during parsing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted HTML document.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The vulnerabilities detailed are all related to improper handling of input, specifically in the HTML parsing and form processing parts of the `w3m` application.  They range from simple null pointer dereferences to more dangerous buffer overflows and stack overflows.  An attacker needs to provide a crafted HTML input file to exploit these flaws, and the resulting impact is either a crash/denial of service, or potentially, in the case of the buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution.
