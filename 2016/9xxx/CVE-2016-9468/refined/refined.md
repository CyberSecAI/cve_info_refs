Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which are related to CVE-2016-9468

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way error messages, particularly exception messages, were displayed in the HTML output. These messages could potentially be influenced by user-controlled input, leading to confusing or even misleading output. For instance, a filename containing email addresses or other text could be displayed within the error message, potentially creating confusion or allowing for the injection of arbitrary strings into the error page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Displaying exception messages could reveal potentially sensitive information about the server's internal state or the application's behavior.
*   **Misleading Error Messages:** User-influenced content within error messages could confuse users or make troubleshooting more difficult.
*   **Potential for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Although not explicitly mentioned in the commit messages, there's a risk that user-controlled input injected into error messages could be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confusing Error Pages:** Users might encounter error pages containing misleading information derived from their input.
*   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive details about the serverâ€™s internal workings could be revealed to the user through error messages.
*   **Potential for XSS:** In a scenario where user-controlled input is not sanitized before being added to the error message, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulating User Input:** An attacker could craft a filename or other input that would be included in an exception message. This could be achieved by trying to access a file with a malicious name that will trigger an error.
*   **WebDAV interface:** The vulnerability existed in the WebDAV interface of the application which handles file requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP and WebDAV:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how HTTP and WebDAV requests work.
*   **Access to the Affected Application:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make requests to the affected application, potentially with the ability to influence input.

**Technical Details:**

The commits address this issue by removing the display of the exception message in the HTML error page. Specifically, the following changes were made:

*   **`apps/dav/lib/files/browsererrorpageplugin.php`**: The `generateBody` function was modified to not pass the exception message to the template.
*   **`apps/dav/templates/exception.php`**: The template was changed to not display the exception message.
* The `sendResponse()` function was modified to include an exit() to prevent XML output from being appended to the HTML.

These changes effectively prevent user-influenced content from being directly included in the HTML error page, eliminating the vulnerability.
