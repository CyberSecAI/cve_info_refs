- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication check for a critical resource or functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  IBM QRadar SIEM does not perform an authentication check for a critical resource or functionality allowing anonymous users access to protected areas.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Anonymous users can access protected areas. The CVSS vector indicates low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access, and does not require any privileges or user interaction.
