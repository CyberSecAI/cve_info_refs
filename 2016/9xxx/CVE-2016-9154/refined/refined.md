- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient entropy in the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate certificates for HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of a PRNG with insufficient entropy leads to predictable random numbers, making the generated certificates vulnerable to private key recovery.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to recover private keys used for HTTPS in the integrated web server of the affected devices. This could lead to interception and decryption of sensitive communications, potentially compromising control over building automation systems.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the affected device via the network. The technical details suggest a degree of difficulty in crafting a working exploit.
