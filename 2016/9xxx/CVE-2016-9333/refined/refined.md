- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to gain administrator privileges on the SoftCMS application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted input to the SoftCMS application. This input is not properly sanitized allowing for the injection of SQL commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require any user interaction. A low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.
