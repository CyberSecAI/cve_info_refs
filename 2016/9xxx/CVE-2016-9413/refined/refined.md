Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-9413:

**CVE-2016-9413:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Clickjacking in ACP (Admin Control Panel)
*   **Risk:** Low
*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper frame protection mechanisms in the MyBB Admin Control Panel. This allows a malicious website to embed the ACP within an iframe and trick users into performing unintended actions.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of frame busting techniques or Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent embedding of the ACP within an iframe.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate an administrator into performing unintended actions within the ACP through clickjacking. This could lead to unauthorized changes or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious webpage that includes an iframe containing the targeted MyBB ACP. The attacker would then use social engineering techniques to entice an administrator into visiting the malicious page.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage.
    * The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to the malicious webpage.
*   **Fix:** Add frame protection such as frame busting scripts or CSP headers.
