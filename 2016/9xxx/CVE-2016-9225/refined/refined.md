Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-9225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the data plane IP fragment handler of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) CX Context-Aware Security module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of IP fragments. Specifically, the CX module fails to correctly process certain IP fragments, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit of this vulnerability causes the ASA CX module to become unable to process further traffic.
*   This results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, effectively disrupting the security services provided by the CX module.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted IP fragments to the affected ASA device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (unauthenticated).
*   The attacker can be remote (remote attacker) and does not require any special access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send IP fragments to the target ASA device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the ASA CX Context-Aware Security module.
*   There are no workarounds that fully address the vulnerability, though a mitigation is suggested to drop all IP fragments, which may impact legitimate traffic.
*   Cisco will not release software updates to fix this vulnerability as the ASA CX module has reached end-of-life. Customers are advised to migrate to Cisco ASA with FirePOWER Services.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a customer support case.
*   The CVSS score is 8.6 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
