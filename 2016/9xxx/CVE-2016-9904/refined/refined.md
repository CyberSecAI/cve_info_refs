{
  "CVE-2016-9904": {
    "Description": "An attacker could use a JavaScript Map/Set timing attack to determine whether an atom is used by another compartment/zone in specific contexts. This could be used to leak information, such as usernames embedded in JavaScript code, across websites.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a timing attack on JavaScript Map/Set operations. The attacker can infer information based on the time taken for these operations, revealing whether an atom (a unique string) is used in a different security context.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack",
      "Cross-origin information leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information leakage, potentially including sensitive data such as usernames embedded in JavaScript code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can leverage a timing attack via crafted JavaScript code executed in a vulnerable browser.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser.",
     "Additional details": "The fix involves adding a hash code to atoms and using it in HashableValue::hash(). jsid hashing was also updated to use atom->hash() if the id is an atom. This prevents similar attacks on shape tables. The fix was applied to Firefox 50.1, Firefox ESR 45.6, and later versions."
