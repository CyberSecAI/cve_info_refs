{
  "CVE-2016-9534": {
    "Description": "It was found that tif_write.c in libtiff 4.0.6 has an issue in the error code path of TIFFFlushData1() that didn't reset the tif_rawcc and tif_rawcp members.",
    "Root cause": "The error code path of `TIFFFlushData1()` in `tif_write.c` does not reset the `tif_rawcc` and `tif_rawcp` members of a TIFF file object. This can lead to a heap-buffer-overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A heap-buffer-overflow leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted TIFF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted TIFF file to a program using libtiff."
