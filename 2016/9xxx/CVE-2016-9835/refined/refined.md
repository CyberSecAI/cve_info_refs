{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_GET['f']`) in the `jcss.php` file, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "Use of `unserialize()` on data read from a file, which can lead to PHP Object Injection if the file contents are crafted maliciously."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution via PHP Object Injection leading to arbitrary file deletion. An attacker can leverage this to potentially gain complete control of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted GET request to `jcss.php` with a modified `f` parameter to bypass path sanitization and point to a crafted serialized object.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and place a malicious serialized PHP object in a publicly accessible folder, such as the `userdata` directory."
