  "CVE-2016-9069": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "This entry documents a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore` within Mozilla Firefox. This vulnerability is triggered when manipulating the DOM using the `prepend` method.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is that a child node can be freed prematurely when using the `prepend` method while simultaneously handling a `DOMNodeRemoved` event. Specifically, when `nsINode::ReplaceOrInsertBefore` is called within the `prepend` operation, it might use a node that has already been freed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a potentially exploitable crash. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted webpage that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and trigger the `prepend` method in a way that frees the node being used causing a use-after-free condition.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious webpage and have the victim use a vulnerable version of the browser. No user interaction besides visiting the malicious webpage is needed."

      "details": {
