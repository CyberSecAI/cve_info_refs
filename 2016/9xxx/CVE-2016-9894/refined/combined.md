Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
moderate

Attached patch

[handle large sizes in GrResourceProvider::createBuffer](attachment.cgi?id=8800921&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8800921&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1306628&attachment=8800921)

This test-case is causing SkiaGL to create a buffer whose size is will not fit in 32 bits. When creating a GrGLBuffer, the size gets truncated to 32 bits.
So, essentially, Skia calls glBufferData(uint32\_t(size\_that\_wont\_fit)). Then Skia calls glMapBufferRange() on this buffer, to map it into client memory, thinking it is that larger size, even though the size got truncated down to 32 bits. That's why we're overflowing.
This only affects platform on which we use SkiaGL and where sizeof(size\_t) == 8. So, basically, this is Mac only in terms of our default platform/prefs setups.
Android we use SkiaGL, but size\_t is 4 bytes there.

This is probably hidden in nightly because of [bug 1309913](/show_bug.cgi?id=1309913 "RESOLVED FIXED - Not getting accelerated canvas on OS X with E10S"), as we don't use SkiaGL on OS X at all.

Is there a constant somewhere, defined to be 32, that means "this is how much can fit in the GrGLBuffer" that we could use instead of "32" and "31"?

The 31/32 here only refer to the size of a dword, and not particular to anything in a GrGLBuffer, and is just to turn a 32 bit next-power-of-2 routine into a 64 bit one, independent of any other limit. The actual validation of whether the allocation succeeds is done elsewhere, so the issue is just making sure we are actually giving the allocation the size we thought we were giving it. In this case, we were giving it an inaccurate size because of that 64->32 bit issue.

The patch itself doesn't implicate mapping the buffer with the truncated size as being the problem, so you'd have to have intimate knowledge of Skia to understand why this becomes a security vulnerability. You'd also need to be able to have knowledge of where whatever GPU driver is running is going to map buffer memory into the address space to do much with this.

This shouldn't really cause any problems, since it only deals with the allocation of extremely large buffers, larger than just about anyone will ever use in practice, and is only correcting the size of the allocations of said buffers.Flags: needinfo?(lsalzman)

This is sec-crit (risk assessment by dev seems like it's not a common scenario anyways) and we still have another week before we hit RC so I'd be ok to take this one before I gtb 50.0b10 (Monday Oct 24th) noon PST.Flags: needinfo?(rkothari)

Attached patch

[handle large sizes in GrResourceProvider::createBuffer](attachment.cgi?id=8804147&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8804147&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1306628&attachment=8804147)

I realized there was a potential vulnerability still in the 32-bit size\_t case, where if NextPow2 gets called on a value like 0x80000001, that will end up returning 0. So this patch instead handles that by always treating these large values as 64-bit, then clamping them by SIZE\_MAX. So for 32-bit size\_t 0x80000001 will get converted to 0xFFffFFff (32-bit SIZE\_MAX), which while not a power-of-2 is still safe for binning and will not overflow. This will allow the downstream buffer allocation to gracefully fail.
Since we still do have 32 bit builds, I didn't want to leave this lurking gremlin in there, even though this bug was pointing at 64 bit builds.

Sec-approval request remains the same, more or less.
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The patch itself doesn't implicate mapping the buffer with the truncated size as being the problem, so you'd have to have intimate knowledge of Skia to understand why this becomes a security vulnerability. You'd also need to be able to have knowledge of where whatever GPU driver is running is going to map buffer memory into the address space to do much with this.

This patch can be easily backported to all branches.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This shouldn't really cause any problems, since it only deals with the allocation of extremely large buffers, larger than just about anyone will ever use in practice, and is only correcting the size of the allocations of said buffers.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
