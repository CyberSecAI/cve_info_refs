The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9304.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper memory allocation within the Autodesk FBX SDK when processing malformed DFX files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: leading to access of unallocated memory and potential code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Denial of Service: Malformed files can cause infinite loops or other conditions leading to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a malformed DFX file via the FBX SDK library functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malformed DFX file.
- The user needs to open this file using an application or service that utilizes the vulnerable FBX SDK.
