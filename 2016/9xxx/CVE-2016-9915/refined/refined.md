Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9915:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Plan 9 File System (9pfs) implementation within QEMU. Specifically, the '9p-handle' backend driver was not freeing allocated data objects properly during cleanup operations. This resulted in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The primary issue is a failure to deallocate memory used by the 9p-handle backend driver when it's no longer needed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: A privileged user within a QEMU guest could trigger the memory leak, potentially exhausting host memory resources. This can lead to:
   - Denial of service: The host system could become unstable due to lack of memory, and QEMU process on the host may crash.
   - Affecting other services: Host memory exhaustion could impact other services running on the same host.

**Attack vectors:**
- Guest-to-host: A privileged user or process running inside a QEMU guest virtual machine can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Privileged access within a QEMU guest is required. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the 9pfs functionality in a way that triggers the memory leak.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this vulnerability is addressed in the commit `971f406b77a6eb84e0ad27dcc416b663765aee30` which adds a cleanup operation for the handle backend driver.
- This issue is related to other similar memory leak issues in the 9pfs implementation, specifically CVE-2016-9913, CVE-2016-9914 and CVE-2016-9916 which were addressed with similar patches.
