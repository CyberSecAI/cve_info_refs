Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An infinite loop vulnerability exists in the `tiftoimage` function of OpenJPEG, specifically when processing malformed TIFF files. This infinite loop leads to a heap buffer overflow.
- The overflow occurs in the `convert_32s_C1P1` function, as well as potentially other `convert_*_*` functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** Due to the infinite loop and incorrect size calculations, the program attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer in the heap, which is allocated in `tiftoimage`.
- **Infinite Loop:** A malformed TIFF file can trigger an infinite loop within the `tiftoimage` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code due to the heap buffer overflow.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop can cause a denial-of-service condition by consuming excessive resources.
- **Unspecified Impacts:** There could be other unspecified impacts from this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed TIFF File:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted or malformed TIFF file.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `tiftoimage` function attempts to process the malicious TIFF file using OpenJPEG's `opj_compress` utility or other utilities using the `tiftoimage` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** An attacker could be remote and doesn't need any specific access or privileges.
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to provide the malformed TIFF file as input to a program using the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "chunibalon" of VARAS@IIE.
- The issue was present in OpenJPEG version 2.1.2.
- A patch for the issue can be found at the provided github link: `https://github.com/szukw000/openjpeg/commit/cadff5fb6e73398de26a92e96d3d7cac893af255`
- The vulnerability was addressed in OpenJPEG 2.3.0.
- The fix involves correcting the size calculations and logic within the `tiftoimage` function as seen in the patch, primarily by checking the value of `ssize` which indicates how much of a strip was read, and ensuring it is valid.
