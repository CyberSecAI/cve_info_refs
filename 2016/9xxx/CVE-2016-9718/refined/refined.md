- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Server's web UI, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web UI, potentially leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be a user with the ability to interact with the web UI and inject JavaScript code. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R). An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can execute this attack.
