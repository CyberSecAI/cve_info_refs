Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9861:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a limitation in URL matching within phpMyAdmin's URL redirection mechanism. This limitation allowed attackers to bypass the intended whitelist protection for URL redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **URL Redirection Bypass:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation of URLs, allowing for redirects to arbitrary external sites not included in the whitelist.
-  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the provided URLs before processing them for redirection.
-  **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**: This is the specific CWE that applies to the vulnerability.
-  **CWE-661: Improper Handling of URL:** This CWE describes the general category of vulnerabilities related to mishandling of URLs.
- **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**: This CWE describes vulnerabilities related to lack of input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Malicious Redirection:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to redirect users to malicious websites. This could lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other forms of social engineering.
-  **Phishing:** An attacker could redirect to a fake login page and steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **URL Manipulation:** Attackers likely exploit this by crafting malicious URLs with specific patterns that bypass the whitelist.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without requiring prior authentication to the application.
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker must have the ability to craft a URL that will bypass the whitelist protection and redirect to a malicious site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- The issue was resolved in phpMyAdmin versions 4.6.5, 4.4.15.9, 4.0.10.18, and newer.
- Patches are available for branches 4.0, 4.4, and 4.6.
