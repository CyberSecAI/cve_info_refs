The content is related to CVE-2016-9294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference in the `cexit` function within `jscompile.c`. The vulnerability occurs because a "node" may not have a parent, and the code doesn't check for a null parent pointer before referencing it. Specifically, the issue arises with degenerate labeled break/continue statements where the target label is attached to the break statement itself and not an enclosing statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to segmentation fault (SEGV)

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting malicious Javascript code that includes a degenerate labeled break or continue statement.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide the malicious Javascript code to the MuJS interpreter, such as loading a malicious script.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `cexit` function in `jscompile.c`.
- The fix involved starting the search for break/continue targets one level up from the current statement.
- The provided stack trace and ASAN output point to the exact location of the crash.
- A proof of concept (PoC) script is mentioned in the bug report, indicating a clear way to trigger the vulnerability.
