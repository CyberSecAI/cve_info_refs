Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper escaping of usernames when displayed in the audit trail widget on the dashboard after a user logs in. This allows for the injection of malicious code within the username field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Usernames were not properly sanitized or escaped when displayed in the audit trail, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system failed to validate and sanitize user input, specifically usernames, before displaying them on the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Account takeover:** An attacker with the ability to create new users could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field. When an administrator views the audit trail, the injected code is executed within the administrator's session allowing the attacker to potentially gain full access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **User creation:** An attacker with sufficient privileges to create new users can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious username.
- **Audit log:** The attack is triggered when an administrator views the audit trail on the dashboard, causing the malicious code within the compromised username to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the capability to create new user accounts.
- **Privileged user creation:** The attacker must have the privileges to create new users.
