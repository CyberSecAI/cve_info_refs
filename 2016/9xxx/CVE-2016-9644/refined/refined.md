Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-9644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue within the `__get_user_asm_ex` implementation in the Linux kernel, specifically affecting x86/x86_64 architectures. This implementation contained extended assembly statements that were not compatible with the exception table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incompatibility between extended assembly statements and the exception table within the kernel's `__get_user_asm_ex` implementation.
- This leads to a situation where a local attacker could exploit this incompatibility to potentially gain administrative privileges.
- The vulnerability existed in Linux kernel versions 4.4.22 to 4.4.29 inclusive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could potentially gain administrative privileges by exploiting this issue. This implies a complete compromise of the system's security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the vulnerable system is required for exploitation.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the kernel, specifically the `__get_user_asm_ex` function with the problematic extended assembly statements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
- The attacker requires sufficient permissions to execute code that can call or trigger the vulnerable code path in the kernel.

**Additional Notes:**

- The original fix for this issue was a 3-line patch which introduced a new vulnerability where a jump to a userland address was possible.
- The `__get_user_ex(x, ptr)` function was meant to zero 'x' on failure, but did not, leading to an information leak from the kernel stack. This was addressed by a separate patch not included in stable kernels.
- Older CPUs without SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention), specifically those prior to Intel Ivy Bridge, are most affected.
- The initial fix attempt introduced a trivial root exploit, which was subsequently reverted.
- The exploit can be prevented by security mitigations like grsecurity's KERNEXEC and UDEREF plugins.

This vulnerability was also addressed in Ubuntu Security Notices USN-3146-1 (for Ubuntu 16.04) and USN-3146-2 (for Ubuntu 14.04 HWE).
