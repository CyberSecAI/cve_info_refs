```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the mpegts parser, specifically within the _parse_pat function. The code reads beyond the bounds of allocated memory, leading to a null pointer dereference.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read, null pointer dereference. The vulnerability is in the gstmpegtssection.c file, related to Program Association Table (PAT) parsing. The code assumes a minimum size for the section_size, but it's not validated. This leads to a read beyond the bounds of the memory.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a crash in an application using GStreamer or potentially gain the ability to execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: A specially crafted MPEG-TS file can trigger the vulnerability.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted MPEG-TS file to a vulnerable GStreamer application.
