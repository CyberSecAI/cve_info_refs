{
  "CVE-2016-9537": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the `tools/tiffcrop.c` of the libtiff library. This can lead to a crash or memory corruption and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `loadImage` function of `tools/tiffcrop.c` where the code does not properly handle buffer sizes, specifically when reallocating the read buffer (`read_buff`) when the required buffer size (`buffsize`) exceeds the previous buffer size (`prev_readsize`).",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or memory corruption, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted TIFF file using the `tiffcrop` tool."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious TIFF file and convince a user to process it with the vulnerable `tiffcrop` utility."
  }
