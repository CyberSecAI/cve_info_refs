Use CVE-2016-9275 for this buffer over-read. Although the commit is
the same as for CVE-2016-9276, fixing CVE-2016-9275 apparently
requires the dwarf_macro5.c part of the commit.

# libdwarf: heap-based buffer overflow in \_dwarf\_skim\_forms (dwarf\_macro5.c)

Posted on [November 7, 2016](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/11/07/libdwarf-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-_dwarf_skim_forms-dwarf_macro5-c/ "6:20 pm") by [ago](https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/author/ago/ "View all posts by ago")

**Description**:

[libdwarf](https://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html) is a library to consume and produce DWARF debug information.

A fuzz on an updated version revealed a buffer overflow.

The complete ASan output:
