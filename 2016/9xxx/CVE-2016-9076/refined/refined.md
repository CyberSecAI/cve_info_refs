  "CVE-2016-9076": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is related to a URL spoofing issue that can occur when using a <select> dropdown menu in Firefox with e10s enabled. The dropdown menu can cover the location bar.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `<select>` dropdown menu can extend beyond its intended bounds and overlay the browser's location bar when e10s is enabled.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper restriction of UI element bounds",
        "URL spoofing vulnerability due to UI overlay"
       ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could potentially trick a user into believing they are on a different website than they actually are. This could lead to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious website with a crafted `<select>` element."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a website with a malicious `<select>` element. The user must also have e10s enabled in Firefox to be vulnerable.",
       "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is specific to Firefox when e10s is enabled, and was addressed by properly constraining the bounds of popups."

  "CVE-2016-9074": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is related to an insufficient timing side-channel resistance in the divSpoiler code within the Network Security Services (NSS) library.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that the division operation used within the divSpoiler mechanism is not constant time on some CPUs, which is used to avoid timing side channels during crypto operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient timing side-channel protection",
        "Non-constant time division operation"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could potentially use timing attacks to extract sensitive information from cryptographic operations. This could expose keys or other confidential data.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Timing analysis of cryptographic operations"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to perform precise timing measurements of cryptographic operations. No specific user interaction is needed for the attack.",
       "additional_notes": "This issue was addressed by replacing the division-based 'divSpoiler' method with a Barrett reduction method."
