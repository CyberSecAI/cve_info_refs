- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Jazz Foundation could expose sensitive information through error message stack traces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. Error messages may contain sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can trigger the generation of error messages which will reveal stack traces, which may contain sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated.
