{
  "CVE-2016-9185": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service's template validation method allows specifying a template via URL. By using invalid HTTP URLs (e.g., to localhost), a network port scan can be performed due to detailed error messages being returned.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Network port scanning vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user could conduct network discovery, revealing internal network configurations and potentially exposing running services on the internal network by leveraging the detailed error message returned when providing an invalid URL for a heat template.",
    "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user provides a crafted URL in the template_url parameter when creating a new Heat stack via the API or a front-end like Horizon.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment, capable of creating Heat stacks and specifying the template URL. No other special privileges or network access is explicitly stated."
