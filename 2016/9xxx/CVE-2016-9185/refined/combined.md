For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Topic

An update for openstack-heat is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking. The service can be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and applications. Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

Security Fix(es):

* An information-leak vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service. Launching a new stack with a local URL resulted in a detailed error message, allowing an authenticated user to conduct network discovery and reveal the details of internal network services. (CVE-2016-9185)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1404464#c0)  Robin Cernin    2016-12-13 22:13:58 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When we change image and do heat stack update it doesn't re-inject the personality files.  By default OS::Nova::Server image_update_policy is doing REBUILD of an instance.  <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/openstack.html#OS::Nova::Server-prop-image_update_policy>  We can see that in nova when we call rebuild we preserve all the VMs metadata and personality files.  Also it's bit confusing since in Heat Resource OS::Nova::Server it shows that the personality property is update_allowed: false and from the developer_guide [1] we can see that this means that update is accomplished only by delete and re-create.  # heat resource-type-show OS::Nova::Server  | grep personality -A6     "personality": {       "description": "A map of files to create/overwrite on the server upon boot. Keys are file names and values are the file contents.",        "default": {},        "required": false,        "update_allowed": false,        "type": "map",        "immutable": false  When we switched the image_update_policy to REPLACE it worked, that could be explained by above.  However if the personality files are preserved with nova, shouldn't it also be same for Heat?  [1] <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/developing_guides/pluginguide.html>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  heat 2015.1.2  How reproducible:  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create stack 2. Change image to another image. 3. Update stack with new image  Actual results:  Personality files not injected  Expected results:  Inject personality files.

I'm not sure if we can backport downstream to OSP7. Zane could you please confirm, if it's possible?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1404464#c5)  Zane Bitter    2016-12-21 17:33:34 UTC  ``` Once the fix and stable backports have been accepted upstream there's no reason we couldn't backport to RHOS 7/8.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1404464#c6)  Zane Bitter    2017-01-26 21:36:23 UTC  ``` Ocata fix and backports to Newton and Mitaka have all merged upstream.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1404464#c10)  Ronnie Rasouli    2017-06-14 08:26:02 UTC  ``` medium BZ   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1404464#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-14 15:31:10 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1456)

## Topic

An update for openstack-heat is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking. The service can be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and applications. Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-heat (5.0.3). (BZ#1409638)

Security Fix(es):

* An information-leak vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service. Launching a new stack with a local URL resulted in a detailed error message, allowing an authenticated user to conduct network discovery and reveal the details of internal network services. (CVE-2016-9185)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, when heat-engine was terminated during startup, it tried to clean up processes that had not been started. Consequently, heat-engine reported and logged the "NoneType" attribute error. This behaviour has been corrected, and heat-engine now shuts down gracefully. (BZ#1389972)

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1418159#c0)  Akira YOSHIYAMA    2017-02-01 04:12:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1246507](attachment.cgi?id=1246507&action=diff "our patch to fix this problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1246507&action=edit "our patch to fix this problem") our patch to fix this problem  Description of problem: Heat uses Keystone Trust to build a stack as a tenant user. To do so, heat-engine needs connections to a Keystone admin API endpoint. In multi-region environment, each region may have its own Keystone admin API and Keystone may have multiple endpoint entries. In this case, heat-engine uses the 1st. So, heat-engine in regions without the 1st endpoint tries to connect another region with the 1st. It will fail if there is no route to the endpoint.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-heat-common-6.0.0-8.el7ost.noarch  How reproducible: 100% in regions without the 1st endpoint.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Register multiple Keystone admin endpoints. The 1st entry should have dummy region name and inaccessible IP address from heat-engine. 2. "heat stack-create <template>" 3.  Actual results: heat command failed with and error: ConnectFailure: Unable to establish connection to http://<inaccessbile>:35357/v2.0/OS-TRUST/trusts  Expected results: heat-engine works properly and the stack creation completed.  Additional info: The attached patch fixes the problem.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1418159#c1)  Zane Bitter    2017-02-02 15:57:54 UTC  ``` Can you please submit this patch upstream and post a link to the review here? I will make sure it gets reviewed and backported. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1418159#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-14 15:37:14 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# RHSA-2017:1464 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-heat security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1464)

## Topic

An update for openstack-heat is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Orchestration (heat) is a template-driven engine used to specify and deploy configurations for Compute, Storage, and OpenStack Networking. The service can be used to automate post-deployment actions, which in turn allows automated provisioning of infrastructure, services, and applications. Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.

Security Fix(es):

* An access-control flaw was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service where a service log directory was improperly made world readable. A malicious system user could exploit this flaw to access sensitive information. (CVE-2017-2621)
* An information-leak vulnerability was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service. Launching a new stack with a local URL resulted in a detailed error message, allowing an authenticated user to conduct network discovery and reveal the details of internal network services. (CVE-2016-9185)

Red Hat would like to thank Hans Feldt (Ericsson) for reporting CVE-2017-2621.

### Bug Description

Launching a new Heat stack and giving the template from an URL like <http://localhost:22>

Results in an error message like:

ERROR: Could not retrieve template: Failed to retrieve template: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine('SSH-2.0-OpenSSH\_6.6.1\r\n',))

This is a security issue as it allows users to scan the network for listening ports.

heat CLI does not allow that:

heat stack-create -u <http://localhost:22> test

[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

Could you share more detail on how to reproduce the issue reported?

I tried to reproduce it but I failed so far. What I did is as follows:

- Visit Horizon stack table page

- Click 'Launch Stack' button

- Select 'URL' as 'Template Source' and specify '<http://localhost:22>' as 'Template URL'

- After clicking 'Next', I got '[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer' (as CLI returns)

Note that I used the master branch (newton) of Horizon code and python-heatclient (1.3.0).

The "Connection Reset by Peer" is an error I'd expect in a number of cases that could still

indicate the port scan could be completed.

It might be the case that the CLI error is because it is trying to connect to port 22 on the end-user's machine which it is not running. It is important to verify "ssh" is running on whatever machine (or something on port 22) on the machine executing the heat template get (aka the machine running horizon or the user's local machine if it is the CLI).

I reproduced that issue with stable Liberty.

Horizon shows me the SSH banner and on the same host the heat CLI returns 'Connection reset by peer'.

Would it be acceptable if the BadStatusLine exception was replaced by a more generic exception such as HTTPException before it is returned to client ?

Yes, horizon should behave like the CLI and not return remote content to the User, if it recognizes that there is no valid template to load from remote.

This is a general issue. You probably don't want your horizon host to spoof your network.

In any case, you probably don't want to expose the information of running services in the internal network.

If I'm not mistaken, Horizon strictly uses the heat api, and does not connect to the resource itself.

We don't do anything other than wrap the client, so I'd be very surprised if there is an issue here that doesn't also exist in the Heat API itself, even if the CLI command has some data cleaning going on.

This problem originates in the template validate method of the heat API: <http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/orchestration/v1/?expanded=validate-template-detail>

If the method is called with '{"template\_url": "<http://localhost:22>"}' the same issue as raised by Tom appears, as you can see in the following curl command:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: 591b637a85af47c0bd406cc7db9c3cb1" -X POST -d '{"template\_url": "<http://localhost:22>"}' <http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1/3659e5effe5a473f9dd579dd8bbeca9f/validate>

{"explanation": "The server could not comply with the request since it is either malformed or otherwise incorrect.", "code": 400, "error": {"message": "Could not retrieve template: Failed to retrieve template: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine('SSH-2.0-OpenSSH\_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.1\\r\\n',))", "traceback": " File \"/opt/stack/heat/heat/common/wsgi.py\", line 842, in \_\_call\_\_\n request, \*\*action\_args)\n File \"/opt/stack/heat/heat/common/wsgi.py\", line 916, in dispatch\n return method(\*args, \*\*kwargs)\n File \"/opt/stack/heat/heat/api/openstack/v1/util.py\", line 38, in handle\_stack\_method\n return handler(controller, req, \*\*kwargs)\n File \"/opt/stack/heat/heat/api/openstack/v1/stacks.py\", line 610, in validate\_template\n data.template(),\n File \"/opt/stack/heat/heat/api/openstack/v1/stacks.py\", line 122, in template\n raise exc.HTTPBadRequest(err\_reason)\n", "type": "HTTPBadRequest"}, "title": "Bad Request"}

This does not only happen with liberty, but also with newer releases and the current master version.

You can't see this issue in newer version of horizon, because they changed the behaviour from calling the validate method with 'template\_url' to fetching the template themselves from the given url and then calling the validate method with 'template'.

So "ERROR: Could not retrieve template: Failed to retrieve template: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine('SSH-2.0-OpenSSH\_6.6.1\r\n',))" is the error message issued by the heat-api, whereas "[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer" is the error message issued by the client and newer versions of horizon.

As I see it, the easiest way to fix this would be to change the error message in <https://github.com/openstack/heat/blob/master/heat/common/urlfetch.py#L54> to not include the error message from the URLError. So instead of raising URLFetchError(\_('Failed to retrieve template: %s') % sex) it should just raise URLFetchError(\_('Failed to retrieve template')).

TL;DR The problem lies in the heat API, not in horizon. Easiest way to fix this would be to suppress the exact error message in heat.

Patch looks good to me. It'd be even better if we could log the exception so the operator can see what's happening.

Long-term I'd love to get rid of the ability to specify a template\_url altogether, but that wouldn't be backwards-compatible so we're effectively forced to wait for a new API version.

Zane, thanks for the suggestion to log the incident.

Here is a new patch which logs the exception.

I chose info as log level and used the same message the exception had before.

I hope that's ok? If not I can update the patch with a new log level/message.

If we do an embargoed disclosure, then we could submit the patch around next week or the week after (most openstacker are still recovering from the summit I guess).

Though this doesn't seems like a critical bug and it could probably skip the embargoed disclosure part. In that case we should at least wait for the CVE assignment before making it public so that we can fast-track the advisory.

Tristan's impact description in comment #10 looks good to me, unless versions prior to 5.0.0 are also vulnerable (in which case we should omit the <=5.0.0 from the Affects line).

As for "skipping" advance notification but still doing everything else under embargo, I don't think there's a viable middle ground. Either the bug is not severe enough to need an embargo in which case we should go ahead and open it now even if patches aren't ready and CVE assignment hasn't happened, or it's severe enough we need to continue to follow our pre-OSSA downstream notification process with its usual coordination timeline. Waiting to disclose the bug until we have fixes figured out and tracking assigned in private but not giving our downstream stakeholders a heads up about it sends mixed signals to the community at large.

++ to everything Jeremy said.

#19 looks good to me.

I prefer to err on the side of caution and since this has been maintained "private" this should be pushed as embargoed.

We should not skip/change the process. It is important to maintain consistency in reporting/disclosing security bugs.

I'm pretty sure that this bug has been around substantially forever, so we should probably put Affects: <=7.0.0

Now that I understand the process a little better from comment #23, I think I'm saying that this is IMHO not severe enough to require an embargo. If waiting for a CVE is not appropriate then I'd be fine with flipping this to public now and just committing the patch (which is ready to go).

Prevent template validate from scanning ports

The template validation method in the heat API allows to specify the

    template to validate using a URL with the 'template\_url' parameter.

By entering invalid http URLs, like '<http://localhost:22>' it is

    possible to scan ports by evaluating the error message of the request.

For example, the request

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: <TOKEN>" \

    -X POST -d '{"template\_url": "<http://localhost:22>"}' \

    <http://127.0.0.1:8004/v1/><TENANT\_ID>/validate

causes the following error message to be returned to the user:

"Could not retrieve template: Failed to retrieve template:

    ('Connection aborted.',

    BadStatusLine('SSH-2.0-OpenSSH\_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.1\\r\\n',))"

This could be misused by tenants to gain knowledge about the internal

    network the heat API runs in.

To prevent this information leak, this patch alters the error message

    to not include such details when the url scheme is not 'file'.

While this issue appears fixed for any localhost calls, Horizon/Heat still returns additional information when an IP is provided. For instance, when using <http://x.x.x.x:22>, if the IP is reachable, the SSH banner is returned. It seems like it should only return "Template format version not found". This occurs when using the URL source, as well as when using direct input and providing the source in the user\_data / get\_file format.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
