Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `IssuableFinder` class using unfiltered user input from the `state` parameter in a `public_send` call on an ActiveRecord relation. This allows an attacker to call arbitrary methods like `delete_all` or `destroy_all` on the underlying model.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized User Input:** The `state` parameter from the URL is passed directly to the `public_send` method without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Insecure use of `public_send`:**  Using `public_send` with unsanitized user input is inherently dangerous as it allows the user to call any public method on the object, including destructive ones.
*   **Incorrect Order of Operations:** The `delete_all` or `destroy_all` methods are called before the project/group scope is applied, which means these operations affect all issues and merge requests within the GitLab instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can delete all issues and merge requests from a GitLab instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is the `state` parameter in the URL when browsing the issues or merge requests overview page. By modifying this parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with access to the GitLab instance. No special privileges are required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to browse the issues or merge requests overview page, and modify the URL to include malicious values for `state` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content confirms that this vulnerability exists. By substituting the `state` parameter with `delete_all`, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability and delete all issues or merge requests, resulting in an HTTP 500 error due to the return value of `delete_all`.

This vulnerability is also addressed by commits included in the provided content. The commits fix the vulnerability by ensuring that only safe methods are called on the `issuable` when filtering by state.
