Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-9130:

**Vulnerability:** Persistent XSS

*   **Root cause:** The website name was not properly escaped when displayed in the `campaign-zone.php` script, and the banner image URL for external banners was not properly escaped when displayed in most of the banner-related pages.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Improper output sanitization of user-controlled data (website name and banner image URLs) within the Revive Adserver's user interface. This leads to the potential for injecting malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected pages. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Account compromise
    *   Defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious activities
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs a trusted (non-admin) account in Revive Adserver.
    *   The attacker would create or edit a website or banner with a malicious website name or banner image URL containing JavaScript code.
    *   When other users (including administrators) view the affected pages (`campaign-zone.php` or banner-related pages), the malicious code is executed in their browsers.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker requires a trusted, non-admin user account on the Revive Adserver instance.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify websites and/or banners.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability is related to HackerOne reports 107550 and 107634.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the website name and banner image URLs using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent the execution of injected JavaScript code. The specific code changes are:
    *   `lib/max/Delivery/adRender.php`: Added htmlspecialchars to the URLs.
    *   `lib/templates/admin/campaign-zone-zones.html`: Escaped website name with `|escape`.
