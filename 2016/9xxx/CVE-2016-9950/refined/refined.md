Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `Package` and `SourcePackage` fields within Apport crash files. These fields are used to construct paths to package-specific hook files located in `/usr/share/apport/package-hooks/`. Due to the lack of sanitization, a crafted crash file can inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) into these fields, leading to the execution of arbitrary Python code from attacker-controlled locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where the application doesn't validate or sanitize user-supplied input (package name) before using it to construct a file path.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the path, an attacker can force Apport to load and execute a malicious Python script placed in an arbitrary location on the file system (e.g., user's Downloads directory).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user running the `apport-gtk` process.
*   **Privilege Escalation (with user interaction):** By placing the malicious crash file in `/var/crash`, which is owned by users with uid < 500, and then having a user open it, an attacker can gain root privileges if the user accepts the PolicyKit prompt.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Crash Files:** Attackers can create a crafted `.crash` file containing malicious path traversal sequences in the `Package` or `SourcePackage` fields.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious `.crash` file, which may be distributed through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other means.
*   **Automatic Download Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage web browsers (like Chromium) which automatically downloads files to the user's Downloads directory without prompting, making it easy to place a malicious `.py` and crash file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to create and distribute the malicious `.crash` file.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user to open the file.
*   **File System Access (for privilege escalation):** To exploit the privilege escalation scenario, the attacker needs write access to the `/var/crash` directory, although this can also be achieved by a low privileged application by using SQL injection.
*   **Ability to place malicious .py files:** The attacker needs a way to get a malicious python file onto the filesystem, such as the user's Downloads directory, in conjunction with the crafted crash file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Apport since version 0.44, released with Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty) in 2007.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the path in `apport/report.py`.
