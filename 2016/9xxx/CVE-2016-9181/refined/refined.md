Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `Image::Info` Perl package, specifically when parsing SVG files, did not disable external entity expansion (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of external entities within SVG files. The `Image::Info` package, when parsing SVG files, did not disable external entity expansion, allowing an attacker to potentially include external content in the parsing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted SVG file could cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information Disclosure:** There is a potential for information disclosure if the crafted SVG file is designed to extract local data or files via external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted SVG file that is processed by an application using the vulnerable `perl-Image-Info` package.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server, they just need the application using the vulnerable component to process the malicious SVG file.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in the `perl-Image-Info` package.
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when processing SVG files
- The issue was fixed in version 1.39 of the perl-Image-Info package.
- The upstream bug report is located at <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=118099>
- Red Hat has marked this vulnerability as "Low" severity with no plans to address it in future updates.
- The CVE assignment message suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable only when `XML::LibXML` is installed (although the CVE is still assigned to `Image::Info::SVG`).
