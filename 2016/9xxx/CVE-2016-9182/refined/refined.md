The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9182.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a case-sensitivity issue in permission checks within the `expFramework.php` file. The code used both the original action name and its lowercase version when checking for permissions and login requirements. This allowed an attacker to potentially bypass permission checks by using the incorrect case for an action name that required specific permissions or login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Case-sensitive permission bypass**: The core issue is that permission and login checks were performed against both the original case of the action name and its lowercase version. Because of this, if a check was missed due to a case mismatch between `perm_action` and `$perms` or between `common_action` and `$perms`, access could be granted incorrectly.
- **Inconsistent permission checks**: The framework was inconsistent in how it handled action names regarding case sensitivity.
- **Potential authorization bypass**: The vulnerability allows bypassing permission checks intended to protect certain actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute actions without the required permissions by exploiting the case-sensitivity discrepancy in permission checks.
- If an action was intended only for logged-in users, this vulnerability could allow unauthenticated users to access the action by sending requests with the action name using the wrong case if not handled properly by other access controls.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send a crafted request to the application with an action name that has a different case than what is specified in the permission array (e.g., 'Edit' instead of 'edit').

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required initially.
- The attacker needs to know the names of the protected actions.

**Additional details:**
The provided content shows a commit that fixes the vulnerability by consistently using lowercase versions of the action names for all checks and ensuring that if an action requires login, it is also properly checked based on the lowercase version. The commit also includes changes to other controller files that use a `requires_login` property to force it to be consistently lowercase.
