- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient protection of administrative credentials within the Siemens-branded IP cameras manufactured by Vanderbilt Industries. Specifically, an attacker could send certain requests to the web server to obtain these credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain administrative credentials, potentially leading to full control of the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the vulnerable device's web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the web server of the affected Siemens IP cameras and the ability to send specific requests. The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.
