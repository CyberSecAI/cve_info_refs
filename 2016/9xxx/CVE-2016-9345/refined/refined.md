- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in the Emerson DeltaV Easy Security Management application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application allows for a local attacker to elevate privileges within a DeltaV control system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to elevate privileges within a DeltaV control system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation. There is no remote exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to a system running the vulnerable application and privileges to install/uninstall Windows applications on the given workstation or server.
