## Analysis of CVE-2016-9446

### Root Cause
The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization step in the vmnc decoder of the GStreamer framework. Specifically, the render canvas allocated for decoding video frames is not initialized before use. This means memory allocated by g_malloc is used without being set to a known value (like 0).

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The primary weakness is the use of uninitialized memory returned by `g_malloc`. The allocated heap memory is not initialized to a known state before being used for rendering.
- **Information Leak**: Exposing uninitialized memory allows for information leaks, where sensitive data residing in the heap can be unintentionally exposed.

### Impact of Exploitation
- **Information Leak:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive data from the heap. If the decoder is used in a server environment to provide thumbnailing services, for instance, this information leak might expose sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While the primary impact is information leakage, improper handling of the uninitialized memory could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, potentially causing a denial of service.

### Attack Vectors
- **Malicious Media Files:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted vmnc video file that triggers the vulnerable code path in GStreamer.
- **Automatic Processing:** By default, if the media file is accessed using applications that use GStreamer (such as video players or thumbnailers), the decoding and therefore exploitation occurs automatically without any user interaction.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need physical access to the vulnerable system.
- **Malicious File Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the specially crafted malicious vmnc video file to the victimâ€™s system. This could occur through a website, file sharing, or email.
- **Limited User Interaction:** Exploitation can occur automatically if the vulnerable system processes the malicious file with a GStreamer based media processing application (such as automatic thumbnailing) without explicit user interaction.

### Additional Notes
- The vulnerability is present in the vmnc decoder within the GStreamer framework.
- The exploit is triggered when a thumbnailing service processes a simple, single-frame vmnc movie.
- The root cause is the allocation of memory with `g_malloc()` without initializing it before further processing.
- Patches involve changing to `g_malloc0` which initializes the allocated memory with zeros.
- Other attack vectors include opening the file in a media player or having it processed by a server that does thumbnailing.
- This vulnerability was discovered alongside a more severe integer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2016-9445) in the same decoder, which led to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Linux distributions that use the GStreamer framework, including Fedora and Ubuntu.
