**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of CVE-2016-9878 is improper path sanitization in the `ResourceServlet` component of the Spring Framework. Specifically, paths provided to the `ResourceServlet` were not properly sanitized.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a directory traversal weakness.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to perform directory traversal attacks, potentially gaining access to files and directories that should be restricted, potentially leaking sensitive data.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests, targeting the vulnerable `ResourceServlet` component.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to send crafted HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable `ResourceServlet`. No specific privilege or authentication seems to be required to exploit this vulnerability.
