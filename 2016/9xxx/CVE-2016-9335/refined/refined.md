- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded cryptographic keys used for secure communication (HTTP SSL/SSH) within the affected devices. These keys are the same across all devices and cannot be regenerated by users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. An attacker could disrupt communication or compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low skill level is needed to exploit. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
