Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of MQTT connection authentication within RabbitMQ. Specifically, the software did not correctly verify user credentials, enabling unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass password authentication for existing user accounts through MQTT connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain access to existing user accounts without providing a password. This grants them the privileges and permissions of the compromised account within the RabbitMQ system.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:**  Depending on the privileges of the compromised account, an attacker could potentially perform further malicious actions such as data manipulation, service disruption, or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **MQTT Connections:** The attack vector is through MQTT connections to the RabbitMQ server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the RabbitMQ server and be able to initiate MQTT connections.
- **Knowledge of User Account:** The attacker needs to know an existing user name in order to log in without a password.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3761-1) confirms that this vulnerability affects RabbitMQ server.
- The advisory provides the fixed versions of the software for different Debian releases (jessie, stretch, sid).
- The provided FAQ document gives general information about Debian Security practices and doesn't seem specific to CVE-2016-9877.
