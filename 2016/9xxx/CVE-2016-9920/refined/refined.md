Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9920:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of custom envelope-from addresses when Roundcube is configured to use the PHP `mail()` function (and thus a local sendmail binary) instead of an SMTP server for sending emails. Specifically, it's related to how Roundcube constructs the command line for the `sendmail` program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Roundcube fails to properly sanitize the custom envelope-from addresses that are passed to the `sendmail` command.
- **Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious envelope-from address, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line parameters to the `sendmail` binary, including options that can execute commands or write to arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server process.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker may be able to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Roundcube webmail interface.
- **Mail Function:** The attack relies on the webmail being configured to use PHPâ€™s `mail()` function for sending emails instead of an SMTP server.
- **Vulnerable Sendmail Configuration:** The underlying MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) being used must allow for the use of custom envelope-from addresses, and specifically allow use of the `-O` or `-X` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Roundcube webmail application.
- The attacker must be able to compose and send emails.
- The Roundcube configuration must use the PHP `mail()` function (thus sendmail binary) instead of an external SMTP server.
- The underlying MTA's sendmail binary must accept the `-O` or `-X` flags which allow for setting options, including output and/or log files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Robin Peraglie using RIPS.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Roundcube versions 1.2.3 and 1.1.7.
*   The recommended workaround is to configure Roundcube to use an SMTP server, or ensure the MTA does not allow for the use of `-O` or `-X` flags with custom envelope-from addresses.
