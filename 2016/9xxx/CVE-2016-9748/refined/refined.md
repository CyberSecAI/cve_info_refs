- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of errors in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation, which leads to the disclosure of sensitive information in error response messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of sensitive information, such as implementation details, internal error messages, database dumps, or error codes, through error response messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information, which can then be used for further attacks against the system. The vulnerability may lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through network access, where a malicious actor can trigger errors that result in the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to interact with the vulnerable application to trigger the error conditions. The vulnerability can be exploited by a low-privileged user.
