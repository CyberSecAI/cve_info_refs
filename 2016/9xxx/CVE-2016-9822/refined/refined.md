{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Signed integer overflow",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A signed integer overflow occurs when multiplying two large numbers, specifically 28573696 * 400, which exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an 'int'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The overflow leads to undefined behavior, resulting in a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted media file with the libav library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious media file for processing by the vulnerable software (libav)."
