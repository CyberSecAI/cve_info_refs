Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-9636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the `flx_decode_delta_fli()` function within GStreamer's FLC/FLI/FLX media file format decoding plugin. This occurs due to a lack of bounds checking when handling the `start_line`, `skip count` and `write count` parameters, allowing an attacker to write beyond the intended buffer boundaries during the processing of FLIC files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `flx_decode_delta_fli()` function.
- Lack of bounds checking on `start_line`, `skip count` and `write count`.
- Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds write.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution through memory manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application crash due to the memory corruption.
- Potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
- Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By supplying specially crafted FLIC files to applications using GStreamer with the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create/modify specially crafted FLIC files
- Ability to entice a user into opening a crafted FLIC file or process it by automated system
- No special privileges required, code execution occurs with the privileges of the user running the application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "scriptless" exploit because the attacker only needs to provide a specific byte sequence in the FLIC file without any additional scripting.
- Multiple ways to trigger the buffer overflow:
  - Specifying a `start_line` value greater than the number of lines in the output canvas (Bug 1).
  - Specifying a `skip count` that goes past the end of the last line of the output canvas (Bug 2).
  - Specifying a `write count` that goes past the end of the last line of the output buffer (Bug 3).
- Red Hat's advisory and the Debian security advisory both note that the fix for this issue involves removing the vulnerable FLC/FLI/FLX plugin.
- The original exploit used in the blog post by Chris Evans shows a method to gain arbitrary code execution. It includes techniques for bypassing ASLR, getting an absolute write primitive, partial pointer overwrites within the thread heap arena, co-opting an addition primitive, and ultimately controlling the flow of the decoding loop, all without explicit scripting.
- GStreamer version 1.10.2 includes a fix for the vulnerability.
- There is a mitigation of removing vulnerable plugins for RHEL.
