{
  "CVE-2016-9467": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the file path handling within the Nextcloud and ownCloud applications. Specifically, the applications failed to properly sanitize and block newline characters (%0A) and null byte characters (%00) within file paths.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Path Traversal Vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker could potentially manipulate file paths by injecting newline or null byte characters, potentially bypassing security checks, leading to unintended access, directory traversal, or unexpected application behavior. This could allow an attacker to access or modify files they shouldn't have access to.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Manipulated file paths via URL parameters"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file path parameter in a URL to inject the malicious characters. This could be achieved through various means, such as crafted links or malicious scripts."
