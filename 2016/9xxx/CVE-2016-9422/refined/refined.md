Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9422:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes within HTML tables. Specifically, if either `rowspan` or `colspan` is set to zero while the other is greater than one, the `HTT_X` and `HTT_Y` attributes for table cells are not calculated correctly. This leads to an inaccurate calculation of the maximum column or row (`maxcol` or `maxrow`), causing a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Table Cell Attribute Calculation:** The core issue lies in the flawed logic for calculating table cell dimensions when `rowspan` or `colspan` is zero. This leads to incorrect values for the cell's `HTT_X` and `HTT_Y` attributes.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The incorrect calculation of `maxcol` or `maxrow` results in w3m writing beyond allocated buffer boundaries, causing a stack smashing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The stack smashing resulting from the buffer overflow can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the w3m process. This is the most severe impact mentioned in the Gentoo security advisory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the overflow can cause w3m to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML file that contains a table with the specific faulty `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes. When w3m processes this file, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide HTML Content:** The attacker must be able to provide the vulnerable w3m instance with a specially crafted HTML document. This could be done via a malicious website, a local file, or any other method where the user could load the attacker's HTML.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified using afl-fuzz, a fuzzer tool.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that both `rowspan` and `colspan` are at least 1.
*   The vulnerability is also associated with issue #8 on the w3m Github repository.
*   The fix for this issue is present in commit `67a3db378f5ee3047c158eae4342f7e3245a2ab1` and `6f6b8ddb7f6ffddc1a361cde429dca546fefc50b`
