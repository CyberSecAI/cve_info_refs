Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of Nasal scripts within the FlightGear flight simulator. Specifically, the route manager within FlightGear does not properly validate file paths when saving flight plans.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core weakness is that a malicious Nasal script can instruct FlightGear's route manager to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system that the user running FlightGear has write access to.
*   **Improper Access Control**: The route manager lacks proper access control, allowing it to overwrite files outside of its intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** Attackers can overwrite user-writable files, leading to data loss. The overwritten data consists of flight plan information in XML format, which could lead to loss of the original file content.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting critical system or application files can cause software malfunctions, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution**: While the initial vulnerability is file overwrite, some sources suggest that this could be chained to achieve arbitrary code execution, however, this is not directly possible from the vulnerability itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Nasal Script:** The primary attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted Nasal script to FlightGear.
*   **Crafted File:** A remote attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious file containing the malicious script that, when loaded into FlightGear, would trigger the file overwrite vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted Nasal script, likely via a malicious file that is loaded by the FlightGear application.
*   The attacker must target files that the user running FlightGear has write access to.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `FGRouteMgr::saveRoute()` and `FlightPlan::save()` functions, where the flight plan is written to a file path provided by a Nasal script.
*   The actual writing is done by `writeProperties()` function.

**Mitigation:**

*   The fix involves sanitizing file paths using `fgValidatePath()` before writing to disk, preventing the route manager from writing to arbitrary files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The overwritten file content is an XML file containing flight plan data, meaning the attacker does not have free control over the contents, but rather what waypoints and parameters are written to it.
*   The vulnerability can lead to data loss and software malfunctions (DoS). The claim of arbitrary code execution is debatable, and likely needs another vulnerability for chaining.
