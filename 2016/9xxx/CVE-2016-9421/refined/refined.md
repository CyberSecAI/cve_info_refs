Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a possible XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability in the ACP (Admin Control Panel) users module of MyBB.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the ACP user module. This can occur when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Malicious script execution:** If successfully exploited, the injected XSS could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's browser session.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This could potentially allow the attacker to perform actions on the forum with the permissions of the administrator, like modifying content, stealing cookies or sensitive data.
*   **Account compromise:** The attacker could potentially take over the administrator's account if they can execute malicious javascript.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the ACP users module. An attacker would need to find an input field or parameter in this module that does not properly sanitize user-supplied data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate or influence the data that is processed by the ACP users module.
*   Specifically, the attacker likely needs to be logged into the ACP and have the permission to use the user management module in the ACP.
