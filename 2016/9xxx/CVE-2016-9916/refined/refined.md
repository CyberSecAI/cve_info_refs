Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from missing cleanup operations in the Plan 9 File System (9pfs) implementation within QEMU. Specifically, the "proxy backend driver" of 9pfs does not free allocated data objects when no longer needed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory Leak: The core issue is a memory leak caused by the failure to deallocate memory used by the 9pfs proxy backend driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): A privileged user within a QEMU guest can trigger the memory leak. Repeated exploitation can lead to exhaustion of host memory resources. This can affect other host services, potentially leading to a crash of the QEMU process itself on the host.
  
**Attack Vectors:**

- Exploitation occurs through the Plan 9 File System (9pfs) functionality in QEMU.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the "proxy backend driver."
- A privileged user inside the guest virtual machine is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest OS.
- The guest OS needs to be using QEMU's VirtFS feature with 9pfs, specifically with the proxy backend driver enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by a patch that adds a cleanup operation to the proxy backend driver.
- CVE-2016-9913, CVE-2016-9914 and CVE-2016-9915 are related issues concerning 9pfs, impacting different parts of the 9pfs implementation (device unrealize, FileOperations, and handle backend driver, respectively).
- The Gentoo security advisory indicates the vulnerability is "exploitable local".
