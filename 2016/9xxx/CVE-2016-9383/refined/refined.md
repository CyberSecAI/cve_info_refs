Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the emulation of the x86 instructions BT, BTC, BTR, and BTS within the Xen hypervisor.
- Specifically, when these instructions are used with a memory destination operand and a source register (instead of an immediate value), Xen incorrectly calculates the memory address and register operand during emulation.
- The high bits of an intermediate expression were discarded during the address and register recalculation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect memory address calculation:** Due to the discarded high bits, the memory location accessed by the emulated instruction could be wrong, either causing access to an unintended location or a fault delivered to the guest.
- **Incorrect register operand value:** Similarly, the register value used in the emulation could be wrong, potentially leading to a host crash or an unintended host memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** A malicious guest could modify arbitrary memory, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code. This could lead to privilege escalation on the host, affecting the entire system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the host system, causing a denial of service.
- **Information leaks:** The vulnerability could also potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Guest:** A malicious guest operating within the Xen environment can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Privileged/Unprivileged Guest User Processes:** On Xen versions prior to 4.7, unprivileged guest user processes could trigger the vulnerability. On Xen 4.7 and later, the vulnerability is exposed to guest user processes with certain privileges (such as direct hardware access), or when a non-default CPU vendor string is configured in the guest VM's configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be in control of a guest VM running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
- For older Xen versions (<=4.6), an unprivileged user inside the guest OS might be able to trigger the vulnerability.
- For Xen versions >=4.7, exploitation requires a guest process to have elevated privileges granted by the guest administrator, or a non-default cpu vendor string to be configured.
- The vulnerability is specific to x86 guests running in 64-bit mode. 32-bit PV guests and ARM systems are not affected.
