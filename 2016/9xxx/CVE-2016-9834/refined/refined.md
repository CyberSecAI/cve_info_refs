Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `LiveConnectionDetail.jsp` page of the Sophos Cyberoam firewall. Specifically, the `applicationname` and `username` GET parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided input, enabling an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions by stealing session cookies.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the web pages.
- **Malicious Content Injection:** Malicious scripts can insert hostile content into the page.
- **User Redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites.
- **Browser Hijacking:**  Attackers could potentially gain control of the user's browser to perform further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via crafted HTTP requests.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically, the victim must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that contains the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Sophos Cyberoam firewall.
- **Social Engineering/Malicious Link Distribution:** The attacker needs to trick a user of the Sophos Cyberoam firewall into clicking a malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable page is located at: `/corporate/webpages/trafficdiscovery/LiveConnectionDetail.jsp`
- The vulnerable parameters are `applicationname` and `username` in the GET request.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject JavaScript using the `applicationname` parameter.
- The PoC video shows a practical attack scenario.

**Affected Software Version:**
- <= Firmware Version 10.6.4

**Vendor Response:**
- The vendor has acknowledged the issue and advised customers to upgrade to Cyberoam OS v.10.6.5, which addresses the XSS vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**
- 6.9 (Medium) (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)
