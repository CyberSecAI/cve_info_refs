Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `WaveletDenoiseImage()` function within ImageMagick.
*   The root cause is an incorrect size calculation when allocating memory for the `kernel` variable. The code allocates `MagickMax(image->rows,image->columns)` instead of `MagickMax(image->rows,image->columns)+1`, which can result in an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when the allocated memory for a buffer is too small and a write operation overflows into adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo security advisory states a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. A heap overflow vulnerability in a graphics library like ImageMagick could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process if exploited correctly.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The Gentoo advisory also mentions a DoS condition as a possible impact. If the heap overflow leads to memory corruption in critical areas, it can lead to application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Processing:** The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted image file using ImageMagick. An attacker could create a malicious image that, when processed, triggers the heap overflow in `WaveletDenoiseImage()`.
*   **Perl Script:** The vulnerability can be triggered using a Perl script (as shown in the provided github content) that calls the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image to an application using ImageMagick or execute a perl script using the vulnerable function.
*   **User Interaction:**  The user needs to process the specially crafted image or run the malicious perl script for exploitation to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
* The patch to resolve the issue involves adding 1 to the result of MagickMax calculation, so that sufficient space is allocated.
* The provided github commit link shows the patch
   `-  kernel=(float *) AcquireQuantumMemory(MagickMax(image->rows,image->columns),`
   `+  kernel=(float *) AcquireQuantumMemory(MagickMax(image->rows,image->columns)+1,`
