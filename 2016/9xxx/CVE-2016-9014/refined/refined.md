{
  "CVE-2016-9014": {
    "description": "Older versions of Django don't validate the 'Host' header against 'settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS' when 'settings.DEBUG=True'. This makes them vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because older versions of Django do not perform host header validation against 'settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS' when the 'DEBUG' setting is enabled. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass the host validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "DNS rebinding vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could use a DNS rebinding attack to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary SQL if a project uses a package like 'django-debug-toolbar'. This could be especially dangerous if developers load a copy of the production database in development, connect to production services, or use superuser accounts.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "DNS rebinding attack",
        "HTTP Host header manipulation"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the Django application server, and the ability to manipulate DNS records.",
      "attacker_position": "The attacker can be remote and can initiate the attack via the victim's browser."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
        "Django 1.10 before 1.10.3",
        "Django 1.9 before 1.9.11",
        "Django 1.8 before 1.8.16"
    ],
     "fixes": "The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that 'settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS' is always validated, regardless of the DEBUG setting. When 'DEBUG=True' and 'ALLOWED_HOSTS' is empty, a fallback list of ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]'] is used."
