Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9437:

**CVE-2016-9437:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by writing data to a read-only memory location (rodata) within the w3m program. Specifically, when parsing a `<button type=radio>` HTML tag, the `formUpdateBuffer` function attempts to write a space character to a buffer located in the rodata section, leading to a segmentation fault.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   **Write to read-only memory:** The primary vulnerability is the attempt to modify a read-only memory region. This indicates a lack of proper bounds checking or memory management within the `formUpdateBuffer` function when handling certain HTML form elements.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash due to a segmentation fault, resulting in denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   **Malicious HTML:** A specially crafted HTML document containing a `<button type=radio>` tag can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   An attacker would need to supply the vulnerable w3m browser with a malicious HTML document. This could happen when the user opens the malicious HTML document with w3m, from a local file or over the web.

**Summary**
CVE-2016-9437 describes a vulnerability in the w3m text-based web browser where a specially crafted HTML document containing a `<button type=radio>` tag can cause the program to attempt a write operation to a read-only memory segment, leading to a crash. This constitutes a denial of service vulnerability.
