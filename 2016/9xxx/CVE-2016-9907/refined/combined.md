RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

MoonGen generate packets from one port, after packets forwarding by dpdk'testpmd in guest(nic0 -> switch -> tap0 -> virtio_net -> testpmd), finally receive the packets from another port.

No, I can not say vIOMMU is faster. It's just very close.  As the results is not that stable, sometimes vIOMMU is faster, but not always. I did another 5 runs to confirm this question.

## 标题

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for RHEV 4.X RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.9.0). (BZ#1387372, BZ#1387600, BZ#1400962)

Security Fix(es):

* A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with the Network Block Device (NBD) client support. The flaw could occur while processing server's response to a 'NBD\_OPT\_LIST' request. A malicious NBD server could use this issue to crash a remote NBD client resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on client host with privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-2630)
* An integer overflow flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in the CCID Card device support. The flaw could occur while passing messages via command/response packets to and from the host. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process. (CVE-2017-5898)
* An information exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator(QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, affecting other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs(CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2016-4020, CVE-2016-6835, CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-7466, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2017-2630, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5898, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375) were fixed as result of rebase to QEMU version 2.9.0.

Red Hat would like to thank Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-6835 and CVE-2016-6888; Li Qiang (360.cn Inc.) for reporting CVE-2017-5898, CVE-2016-7466, CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2017-5579, and CVE-2017-5973; Donghai Zdh (Alibaba Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-4020; Qinghao Tang (Marvel Team 360.cn Inc.) and Zhenhao Hong (Marvel Team 360.cn Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-7422; PSIRT (Huawei Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8669; Andrew Henderson (Intelligent Automation Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8910; Qinghao Tang (Qihoo 360), Li Qiang (Qihoo 360), and Jiangxin (Huawei Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-9921 and CVE-2016-9922; and Li Qiang (Qihoo 360 Gear Team) for reporting CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, and CVE-2017-9375.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2408)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton), and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the user-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in environments managed by Red Hat products.

Security Fix(es):

* Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with Network Block Device (NBD) Server support was vulnerable to a null-pointer dereference issue. The flaw could occur when releasing a client that was not initialized due to failed negotiation. A remote user or process could exploit this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server (denial of service). (CVE-2017-9524)
* An information-exposure flaw was found in Quick Emulator (QEMU) in Task Priority Register (TPR) optimizations for 32-bit Windows guests. The flaw could occur while accessing TPR. A privileged user inside a guest could use this issue to read portions of the host memory. (CVE-2016-4020)
* A memory-leak flaw was found in the Quick Emulator (QEMU) built with USB xHCI controller emulation support. The flaw could occur while doing a USB-device unplug operation. Unplugging the device repeatedly resulted in leaking host memory, which affected other services on the host. A privileged user inside the guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host or potentially crash the host's QEMU process instance. (CVE-2016-7466)
* Multiple CVEs were fixed as a result of rebase to QEMU 2.9.0. (CVE-2016-6888, CVE-2016-7422, CVE-2016-8576, CVE-2016-8669, CVE-2016-8909, CVE-2016-8910, CVE-2016-9907, CVE-2016-9911, CVE-2016-9921, CVE-2016-9922, CVE-2016-10155, CVE-2017-5579, CVE-2017-5973, CVE-2017-6414, CVE-2017-8309, CVE-2017-8379, CVE-2017-9310, CVE-2017-9373, CVE-2017-9374, CVE-2017-9375)
