  "cve": "CVE-2016-9907",
  "description": "Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the USB redirector usb-guest support is vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It could occur while destroying the USB redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'. A guest user/process could use this issue to leak host memory, resulting in DoS for a host.",
  "affected_software": [
    "Qemu"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `usbredir_handle_destroy` function in QEMU's USB redirector does not properly free the vm change state handler during the destruction of the USB redirector.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest user or process can exploit this memory leak to consume host memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the host.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered through the destruction process of the USB redirector within the QEMU environment.",
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious user or process inside the QEMU guest needs the capability to trigger the destruction of the USB redirector."
