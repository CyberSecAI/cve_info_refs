- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software stores user or system passwords unencrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clear text storage of passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with file system access can escalate privileges or obtain access to other systems that the software integrates with. This can lead to unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors:** File system access to the server where QRadar is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the file system of the QRadar server and have a valid user account.
