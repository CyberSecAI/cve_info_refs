- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Jazz Foundation Reporting Service (JRS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to alter the intended functionality of the web application, potentially leading to disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to input data into the web application. The user interface requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability.
