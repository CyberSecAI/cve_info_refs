  "CVE-2016-9573": {
    "description": "A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way openjpeg decompressed certain input images. Due to an insufficient check in the imagetopnm() function, an application using openjpeg to process image data could crash when processing a crafted image. An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in OpenJPEG, in the j2k_to_image tool. Converting a specially crafted JPEG2000 file to another format could cause the application to crash or, potentially, disclose some data from the heap.",
    "affected_component": "openjpeg library",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient checks in the `imagetopnm()` function during decompression of certain input images.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based out-of-bounds read",
      "Potential heap buffer overflow"
    ],
     "impact": "Denial of service (application crash), potential information disclosure from heap memory, and potential arbitrary code execution",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing specially crafted JPEG2000 files",
      "Converting a crafted JPEG2000 file to another format using the j2k_to_image tool"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted JPEG2000 file for processing or conversion"
