{
  "CVE-2016-9588": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel for Intel x86 processors does not properly handle #BP and #OF exceptions in a nested (L2) virtual machine.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of software exceptions (#BP and #OF) in nested virtualization (nVMX) by KVM.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker within a guest VM (L2) can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) in the host (L1) VM.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access within a nested VM.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have local access to the L2 guest VM, and the ability to trigger the specific software exceptions, #BP and #OF"
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel built with KVM virtualization and nested virtualization (nVMX) enabled is vulnerable to an uncaught exceptions issue.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncaught software exceptions in nested KVM environments.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "A user in a L2 guest VM can crash the L1 guest, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
       "Attack vectors": "Triggering specific software exceptions in a nested VM.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A user with access to a L2 guest VM, with the capability to generate software exceptions that are not handled by L1."
