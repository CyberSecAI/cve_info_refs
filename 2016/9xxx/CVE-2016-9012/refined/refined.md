- Gain access to internal CVP configuration mechanisms.
- Take over the CVP instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The attacker must have access to the management plane of the CVP.
- The exploit involves sending a specific GET request to a vulnerable endpoint, as indicated by the log message "GET /web/system/console/bundle HTTP/1.1".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the management plane of the CloudVision Portal.
- The CVSS score indicates that the attacker needs to have low privileges to execute the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a specific log message that can be used to identify if the vulnerability has been exploited.
- Arista Networks identified the vulnerability internally and has no evidence of its exploitation at the time of the advisory release.
- A patch is available in CVP version 2016.1.2.1.
