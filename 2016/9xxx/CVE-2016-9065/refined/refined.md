Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9065:

**CVE Description:** The location bar in Firefox for Android can be spoofed by forcing a user into fullscreen mode, blocking its exiting, and creating of a fake location bar without any user notification.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handles fullscreen mode transitions, specifically in non-e10s mode.
- The browser fails to properly exit fullscreen mode when a fullscreen request isn't fully processed, leading to a state where the location bar is hidden, and a malicious page can create a fake one.
- The browser also doesn't show the fullscreen warning if already exited.
- In addition, the content document doesn't properly handle fullscreen requests when inactive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Location bar spoofing:** Attackers can create a fake location bar that misrepresents the actual URL, potentially leading users to believe they are on a legitimate site when they are not.
- **Lack of user notification:** Users are not informed that they have entered fullscreen mode or that a fake location bar is being displayed.
- **Inability to exit fullscreen:** The browser can become trapped in fullscreen mode, requiring the user to restart the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can use the fake location bar to trick users into entering credentials or other sensitive information on a malicious page disguised as a legitimate website.
- **Malware distribution:** Users could be tricked into downloading and installing malware from a spoofed website.
- **Denial of service:** By trapping the browser in fullscreen mode, attackers can disrupt the user's ability to browse the web.
- **General user confusion:** The unexpected and potentially confusing state of the browser could undermine user confidence.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious web pages:** An attacker can host a web page with code that exploits the fullscreen vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The attack typically requires a user to click on something within the malicious page to initiate the fullscreen state.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) is not required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without intercepting communications.
- **No special permissions needed:** The exploit uses standard web features.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web hosting:** Attackers need to be able to host a web page that can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Basic web development:** Attackers need to have a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious web page.
- **No special access needed:** The attack does not rely on system vulnerabilities or local file access.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects Firefox for Android in non-e10s mode.
- The fix involves changes to how the browser handles fullscreen requests and ensures that the browser exits fullscreen mode if it wasn't properly entered.
- Patches were developed and uplifted to Firefox 50, 51, 52, and were also backported to the beta channel.
- The issue was reported by an external reporter, "Raphael".
- There is a reference to a related bug [1161802] which is about putting a document in fullscreen state and triggering the event after sizemodechange.
- The fix was done through 3 main patches that address different aspects of the issue, with a fourth patch adding a test case (which was eventually disabled on macOS)
- The bug was rated as "sec-high" due to the severity of the spoofing attack, which can be used to steal information or cause denial of service.
