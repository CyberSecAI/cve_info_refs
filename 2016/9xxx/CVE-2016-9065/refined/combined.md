| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1303418#c0)• 8 years ago |
|  | |

@movrcx reported [1] a vulnerability in the addons update process that allows a Man-In-The-Middle attack to replace an installed addon with a fraudulent version. The attacker needs to first obtain a valid signature for a fraudulent addon, which can be done without review, then hijack the call between the user and AMO to replace the response from /update/VersionCheck.php with the IDs of the fraudulent addon.
This attack works because Firefox does not currently verify that the updated addon ID matches the installed addon ID. Adding this check will require the attacker to break into the AMO service or steal the developer access to AMO to sign a fraudulent addon with the same IDs as the target addon.
The ID verification should be implemented in Firefox.

Is this different, or worse, in 49 than it is in 48?

Support for changing IDs was explicitly added in [bug 412819](/show_bug.cgi?id=412819 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mechanism for changing an extension GUID via updates"), but AMO no longer supports changing IDs (not deliberately anyway). Consensus (between Andy and me so far) is to remove this support from Firefox rather than try to design a method for securely changing an ID.

AMO has never really supported changing the ID, but it has been possible for non-AMO add-ons through the update mechanism. I don't think that changing IDs is a very common use case, and there are other ways to do it than via automatic updates (at least with legacy APIs), so I also support this change.

Surprised that this is rated so highly, the only way of circumventing I can think of involves either compromising AMO itself or getting a built-in CA to issue you a valid cert for AMO and then MITM.

No need for the extra parameter, the AddonInstall already has the existing add-on to compare against here.

This patch checks that the downloaded add-on (.xpi) matches the ID of the thing it's supposed to be updating. Would it be worthwhile to check the metadata returned by versioncheck and not even download the thing if it doesn't match?
I mean in addition (multi-layer security); the install-time check is a good thing.
Signed update.rdf responses means it came from us, even if TLS gets MITM'd.
\* prevents changing the hash to match a different add-on
\* prevents changing the download URL to point to a different download server
(signing these is another set of bugs)
But a MITM could still substitute one signed update.rdf for another
\* version check prevents downgrade attack (I think we do this already)
\* ID check could prevent substitution
Currently the add-on ID doesn't appear in the body of the update.rdf, but it is part of "urn:mozilla:extension:%ADDON-ID%" in the RDF junk. We could pull it out of there, but if we want to do this it might be worth adding <em:id> in the body next to <em:version> to make things easier (Server-side change required).

We do already ID check the "urn:mozilla:extension:%ADDON-ID%" since that is what allows you to embed update info for multiple add-ons in the same file.

Not sure how much work the id in the RDF is, probably pretty easy. I feel like the better thing to focus on might be [bug 1303183](/show_bug.cgi?id=1303183 "NEW - Add-on update metadata needs to use content-signing") though.

If I'm reading this right then you could potentially fool this by using a multipackage XPI with the right ID which then installs a different add-on. We should probably always reject multipackage XPIs when there is an existing add-on being updated.

Is the concern about a "regular" addon having an upgrade that points to a multipackage xpi? Or an addon that originally came from a multipackage xpi being upgraded to ... something?
For the first case, the test should fail since this.addon is the multipackage xpi, and its id property will be null or undefined, which won't match the existing addon id. I can add a test for this, or did I misunderstand the issue?

multipackage XPIs don't have to have an ID in the root install.rdf but they can and my brief glance suggests it gets passed all the way through to here, so add a test for that case and then if I'm right fix it so it doesn't work.

Don't allow upgrades that change the addon ID
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Quite easily, but this bug is already public and comments in the bug explain the problem clearly. However, this bug is about adding defense-in-depth so a real exploit would involve other steps, as detailed in the bug description.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, but see above.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This bug has existed for some time, it is present on all currently supported branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The actual code change should be easy to backport, the tests use test code that has been modified recently that may take more effort.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The change is simple and straightforward enough that it is unlikely to cause unintended regressions. The risk is more that somebody somewhere is relying on the previous insecure behavior, but we can handle that if it arises by helping anybody affected to find a supported way to manage addon upgrades.

I pinged Dan about this and he would like to see this uplifted to 50, but it's not urgent for 49 because of HPKP being enabled on the add-on update servers. I'm guessing based on his schedule, he'll get to the sec-review next week.
Sorry about the undue urgency, and thank you for the patch.

Tracking across current versions.
If we end up doing a 49.0.1 this may be a candidate for uplift to release, but we should wait for sec approval and maybe test on 50 first.

Please go ahead and check in.
I'm not against pushing this to a 49 point release if we're confident in it after testing, but this bug doesn't need to be the trigger for a 49 point release. We'll want this on the ESR branch as well.

As of earlier this week, the attached patch applied cleanly to aurora and it was good on try:
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=6b289af413bd&selectedJob=27684834>
Uplift to beta/release is going to take a little more work, I'll try to have a patch ready to test today.

Don't allow upgrades that change the addon ID
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
This is a long-standing bug
[User impact if declined]:
The patch adds extra defense against a particular security vulnerability. Without the patch, we won't have the extra protection.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]:
Tests are included in the patch
[Risks and why]:
The changes are confined to the processing of addon upgrades and are unlikely to cause unintended regressions. The larger risk is if any addon developers are relying on the ability to change addon ids during an upgrade. As discussed in the bug, this is a risk that the add-ons team judges to be acceptable.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
n/a

This try run is a little wacky (no linux debug build?) but
the updated test in this patch does pass on all the other
platforms.

Verified as fixed on Firefox 52.0a1 (2016-09-28/29), Firefox 51.0a2 (2016-09-28/29), Firefox 50.0b2 unbranded build (20160926162149) under Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 7 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit. Tested various scenarios and we confirm that the add-on/webextension is not updated to a new version with different ID.
Covered the following cases:
- unlisted add-on (with id specified in the install.rdf) cannot be updated if the ids don't match
- unlisted webext (with id specified in the manifest.json) cannot be updated if the ids don't match
- unlisted webext (with id NOT specified in the manifest.json) cannot be updated if the ids don't match (webext 1 without id -> webext 2 without id, webext 1 without id -> webext 2 with id)

This seems familiar, we may already have a bug on this. Maybe one of Jordi's bugs? The behavior changed in [bug 1180295](/show_bug.cgi?id=1180295 "RESOLVED FIXED - Redo Fennec dynamic toolbar implementation") though the old behavior was not much better. Seems similar to [bug 928023](/show_bug.cgi?id=928023 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - window.fullScreen enabled on new about:home causes issues (FullScreen Add-On)").
I am not sure that this is a security bug, at best it is a DOS. It leaves the browser in an unusable broken state. Workaround is to swipe close Firefox and let Firefox session restore recover the browser state.

Yes I agree with you that this problem was ranih versions of Firefox, but as you can see, there is now an error. I believe that this is the vulnerability of small, but with a different use of possible spoofing address bar or as you said Dos in the form of advertising (Popunder & clickunder)

This bug is somehow reproducible on desktop as well. It messes up the DOM Fullscreen and Fullscreen mode on Firefox desktop.
I'd say this is a bug in Core rather than Firefox.Group: firefox-core-security → core-securityComponent: General → DOMProduct: Firefox for Android → Core

Part 1 and part 2 are separate bugs I found when I was debugging. Part 3 is the fix of this bug. The test in part 3 depends on the behavior fix in part 2.

This bug can lead to spoofing of full URL bar for Firefox Android, and it requires no more than normal browsing actions (clicking anything would be enough). Based on the rating rules, I suppose it should be sec-high. But note that it isn't a security issue for desktop Firefox.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

part 3 - Exit fullscreen in non-e10s when no fullscreen request is proceeded. r?smaug
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
An exploit is easy to contruct given the test includes an example. If the test is not included, this probably isn't very easy to construct the exploit from this patch.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
May or may not. This is a security issue for Firefox Android, not for desktop Firefox, while the comment doesn't mention Firefox Android at all, so people may not relate this with the exploit on Android.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All current support branches. The related code landed in Firefox 41 in [bug 1161802](/show_bug.cgi?id=1161802 "RESOLVED FIXED - Put document in fullscreen state and trigger the event after sizemodechange"). But given it is an Android-only exploit, I guess we don't need to care about ESR at least.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
All supported branches.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This single patch should be very easy to uplift to all affected branches, and I don't think it is risky. It uses the behavior we've been using in e10s mode. And it only affects edge cases where users shouldn't reach normally.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely. Fullscreen API should be good in terms of test coverage, and this patch also adds a test for this bug.

Good job Xidorn 3 of the patch for a short time.To spoof the address bar, you can use a GIF or a flash animation that will create a more realistic effect. I guess to use the flash address bar ,as if the site will have to scroll the flash animation of the address bar will simulate the effect of sliding

part 3 - Exit fullscreen in non-e10s when no fullscreen request is proceeded. r=smaug
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: [bug 1161802](/show_bug.cgi?id=1161802 "RESOLVED FIXED - Put document in fullscreen state and trigger the event after sizemodechange")
[User impact if declined]: URL Spoofing for Android users.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: test is not landed because it provides an example for construct exploit
[Risks and why]: low risk, since the code path it touches shouldn't be reached in normal cases
[String/UUID change made/needed]: n/a
Only part 3 is necessary for fixing this exploit, but I think part 1 and 2 are low risk as well, so they may be uplifted at the same time.

On desktop, users always have way to exit from fullscreen state, and moving cursor to the top would show the toolbar like in fullscreen mode.
It might be moderately vulnerable given that the fullscreen notice (the "some site is in full screen" message) is not shown. However, it seems to me this bug is only reliable when there is active fullscreen transition, that means on desktop, users would either see a fullscreen transition, or it would not go fullscreen at all, so I guess it isn't that vulnerable.
It is more serious on mobile because user has no way to exit fullscreen, and there is neither any notice nor any transition animation.Flags: needinfo?(xidorn+moz)

Looks like it fails on macOS: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=cfcf47579a6783b2537cf4b7c49c277c47fbb727>
I'm going to land the test with it disabled on macOS, and open a new bug to track why it fails there.Flags: needinfo?(xidorn+moz)

Hi, I can reproduce the issue following the steps from the description on the affected version (Firefox 49 Release version).

Devices:

* Prestigio Grace X5 (Android 4.4.2)
* Motorola Nexus 6 (Android 7.1.1)

Also, verified as fixed on the latest versions:

* Nightly 66.0a1 (2018-01-11)
* Beta 65.0b9
* Release 64.0.2

Due to that, I'll remove the qe-verify flag, thanks.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
