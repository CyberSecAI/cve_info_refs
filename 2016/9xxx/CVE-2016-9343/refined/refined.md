- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow exists due to insufficient validation of Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service by crashing the controller or allow for arbitrary code execution on the targeted controller.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed CIP packet over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and requires a low level of skill to exploit the vulnerability.
