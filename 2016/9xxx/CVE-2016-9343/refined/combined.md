**--------- End Update B Part 1 of 1 --------**

Rockwell Automation’s new firmware versions are available at the following URL:

<http://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductDownload.aspx>

Rockwell Automation’s security notification is available at the following URL, with a valid account:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/970074>

Rockwell Automation recommends that users apply additional precautions and risk mitigation strategies to this type of attack, when possible, which could include the following:

* Use proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help confirm that requests from unauthorized sources are blocked.
* Block all traffic to affected devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222 TCP/UDP and Port 44818 TCP/UDP, using network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, or other security appliances.
* When possible, keep the controller in RUN mode rather than Remote RUN or Remote Program in order to prevent other disruptive changes to the system.

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
