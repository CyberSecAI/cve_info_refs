Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `tomcat8` package's `postinst` script handles directory permissions during upgrades. Specifically, the script makes the `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` directory writable by the `tomcat8` group. This creates a window of opportunity for a local attacker to exploit the situation before the permissions are reset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Permissions:**  The `postinst` script sets permissions on `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` that are too permissive, making the directory writable by the `tomcat8` group.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** A local attacker, with control over the `tomcat8` user, can replace the `localhost` directory (or other files within `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/`) with a symlink to sensitive system files, such as `/etc/shadow`, `/root/.Xauthority`, or `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key`.
*   **Exploitable `chmod`:** During the upgrade process, the `postinst` script attempts to reset permissions using `chmod 775 /etc/tomcat8/Catalina /etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost`, but because the attacker replaced `localhost` with a symlink to a sensitive file, that file permissions gets changed to be world-readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:

*   **Read Sensitive Data:** Expose the contents of sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow` by making them world-readable.
*   **Gain Unauthorized Access:** Make other sensitive system files like `/root/.Xauthority` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key` accessible, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*  **Modify Files:** By making a file already owned by the `tomcat8` group group-writable, they can change policy settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to execute commands as the `tomcat8` user.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink within the `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina` directory before the tomcat package is upgraded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system with the ability to execute commands as the `tomcat8` user.
*  **Timing:** Attackers need to exploit the race condition between the user creating a symlink and the `chmod` command in the `postinst` script being executed.

This vulnerability allows for a local privilege escalation, which can lead to a complete takeover of the system.

**Additional Information from the provided text**:
*  The vulnerability was reported by Paul Szabo.
*  It affects `tomcat8` and similar issues were found in `tomcat6` and `tomcat7`.
* The fix involves not making the `/etc/tomcat8/Catalina/localhost` directory writable by the tomcat8 user anymore. Also files and directories should be delivered with correct permissions in the .deb instead of `postinst`.
