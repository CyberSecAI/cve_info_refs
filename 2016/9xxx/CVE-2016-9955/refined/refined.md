Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check of return values in the signature validation process of SimpleSAMLphp. Specifically, the `openssl_verify()` function returns `1` for successful verification, `0` for failure, and `-1` for an error. Due to PHP's implicit boolean conversion, `-1` (error) was interpreted as `true` (success), leading to invalid signatures being accepted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Boolean Conversion:** The primary weakness lies in the implicit conversion of the integer return value of `openssl_verify()` to a boolean value, where `-1` is incorrectly evaluated as `true`.
*   **Flawed Signature Validation Logic:** The code did not explicitly check for error conditions in the signature verification process, causing it to treat errors as valid signatures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Signature Validation:** Attackers could bypass signature validation by manipulating the XML signature in a way that triggers an error during the validation process.
*   **Impersonation:** By successfully exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could craft or modify SAML 1.1 response messages, get them accepted as valid, and impersonate any user at the service provider.
*   **Data Modification:**  The vulnerability could also be used to get other invalid messages accepted as valid

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Triggering Validation Errors:** The primary attack vector is manipulating signatures in a way that leads to a validation error, which is then misinterpreted as a valid signature by the flawed code.
*   **Specific Error Conditions:** This could be achieved by:
    *   Using a DSA public key to validate an XML signature made with an RSA-related algorithm.
    *   Using an RSA public key to validate an XML signature made with a DSA-related algorithm.
    *   Exhausting available memory during signature verification.
* **Man-in-the-middle:** It is implied that an attacker must be in a position to intercept and modify SAML messages to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SAML 1.1 Context:** The attacker must target a Service Provider that has configured SAML 1.1 metadata for the targeted Identity Provider.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle or Message Modification:** The attacker must be able to modify or create SAML messages.
*   **Knowledge of Error Conditions:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a specific error in the signature verification process, like an algorithm mismatch, or by causing memory exhaustion.
*   **Misconfiguration (optional):** The attacker may attempt social engineering to trick a service provider operator to change a public key to a DSA key

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of SimpleSAMLphp prior to 1.14.11.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported on December 3, 2016, by Thijs Kinkhorst.
*   Exploiting the memory exhaustion condition was considered extremely difficult due to the narrow time window required for successful exploitation.
*   SimpleSAMLphp does not support DSA signatures.
*   The Debian LTS advisory also mentions CVE-2016-9814 and an additional non-CVE vulnerability.
