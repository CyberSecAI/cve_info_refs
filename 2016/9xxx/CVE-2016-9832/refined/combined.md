*[ESNC-2041217] Critical Security Vulnerability in PwC ACE Software for SAP
Security*

Please refer to <https://www.esnc.de> for the original security advisory,
updates, and additional information.

*----------------------------------------------------------------------*
*1. Business Impact*
*----------------------------------------------------------------------*

According to PwC website:
- "Using the proprietary ACE software, we perform diagnostics of SAP’s
inherent risks and backdoors (such as configuration, customization and
security settings) which could be exploited to commit fraud";
- "The purpose of this tool is to analyze SAP security settings and
identify privileged access and potential segregation of duties issues
accurately and efficiently"; and
- "The ABAP files introduce no changes to the production systems and
settings".

PwC ACE software has a remotely exploitable security vulnerability which
allows injection and execution of malicious ABAP code on the remote SAP
system.

Based on the business processes implemented on the SAP systems on which ACE
is installed, this security vulnerability may allow an attacker to e.g.
manipulate accounting documents and financial results, bypass change
management controls, and bypass segregation of duties restrictions. This
activity may result in fraud, theft or manipulation of sensitive data
including PII such as customer master data and HR payroll information,
unauthorized payment transactions and transfer of money.

The attacks may be executed from the local network via SAPGui, or from the
public Internet via http/https ICF services such as WebGui and Report, if
the systems are accessible.

An attacker can misuse PwC ACE security vulnerability in order to:
- make changes to the production systems and their settings including
manipulating or corrupting ABAP programs shipped by SAP and making the
system and data inoperable;
- plant an SAP backdoor for accessing the system and sensitive data later;
and
- shut down the SAP systems and cause downtime.

An in-depth analysis is required to determine whether the system or the
financial data is already compromised via this security vulnerability.
