*   Commit message in the Linux Kernel git repository.

These references confirm that the content relates to CVE-2016-9604.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that the Linux kernel's keyring implementation allowed a root user to directly access and modify internal keyrings, which are normally protected. This was achieved by joining an internal keyring, such as `.dns_resolver` or `.builtin_trusted_keys`, as the root user's session keyring.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect access control:** The kernel failed to prevent root from joining internal keyrings as a session keyring.
*   **Bypassing module verification:** By gaining access to the keyring used for module signature verification, a root user could add their own public keys to the keyring.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: With a modified keyring, a root user could potentially bypass module signature verification to load unsigned or malicious modules.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Module Signature Verification:** The most significant impact is the ability for a root user to bypass module signature verification.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: The ability to add arbitrary keys allows an attacker with root privileges to circumvent security measures.
*   **Denial of Service**: A local attacker could crash the system by adding keys or modifying the keyring in a way that causes instability.
*   **Modification of Trusted Keys:** If the internal keyring such as `.builtin_trusted_keys` is modified the whole system security is weakened.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access**: The vulnerability requires the attacker to have root access to the system.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Root Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a root user on the system.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands that interact with the keyring subsystem.
*   **No special access**: This vulnerability can be triggered by calling the standard keyring control functions.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the `KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING` operation.
*   The fix involves rejecting keyring names that begin with a dot in keyctl, thereby disallowing the root user from directly joining the internal keyrings.
*   The `dm_old_request_fn()` function is mentioned in relation to a related bug, where a `BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled())` call was causing kernel panics on systems with multipathing. This is relevant in the context of kernel patching and changes related to Real-Time (RT) kernels.
*   The fix from commit `ee8f844e3c5a73b999edf733df1c529d6503ec2f` in Linux kernel is to prevent the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2016-9604 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a root user to circumvent module signature verification by gaining direct access to internal keyrings. The attack requires local root access and involves manipulating the keyring subsystem.
