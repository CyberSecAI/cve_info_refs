Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9073:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `windows.create` API in WebExtensions did not properly validate the format of the provided URL. Specifically, it failed to enforce that relative URLs should be treated as relative to the extension's context, not as absolute URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of URL format validation:** The API lacked proper checks to ensure that URLs passed to `windows.create` were correctly formatted as relative URLs, or were at least correctly handled as such, leading to incorrect URL resolution.
- **Bypass of security checks:** Because relative URLs were not correctly resolved, extensions could bypass security checks designed to prevent them from loading privileged URLs. This was happening because relative URLs were being treated as absolute ones.
- **WebExtension sandbox escape:** By loading privileged URLs, a malicious extension could potentially escape its security sandbox and gain elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** A malicious WebExtension could use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges, potentially gaining access to APIs and functionalities that it should not have.
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  Although not directly stated, the possibility of arbitrary code execution may have existed due to the sandbox escape and access to privileged URLs. This may allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or potentially take control of the browser.
- **Data exfiltration:** Malicious extensions may be able to access or steal sensitive user information due to the expanded permissions gained by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Installation of additional extensions:** As stated in CVE-2016-9075 (present in the same advisory), if an extension can elevate its privileges via the `mozAddonManager`, it can install other malicious extensions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious WebExtension:** An attacker could create a malicious WebExtension and distribute it through an app store or other means.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** While not directly related to this vulnerability, it's mentioned in CVE-2016-9064 (also in the same advisory) that an attacker who could perform a MITM attack on the user's connection could potentially supply a malicious extension instead of a valid update to an existing one. Although not the primary vector, this could be leveraged to introduce a malicious extension exploiting CVE-2016-9073 to a user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create and distribute a WebExtension:** An attacker would need to be able to create a malicious extension.
- **User interaction:** Typically, the user needs to install the malicious extension to be vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring URLs passed to windows.create are resolved relative to the caller and that security checks are applied.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 50 and was backported to Firefox 51 and 52.
- The bug report (1289273) indicates that there is a security concern when allowing extensions to load arbitrary URLs marked as DANGEROUS_TO_LOAD.

In summary, CVE-2016-9073 represents a flaw in how WebExtensions handled URLs, allowing them to potentially bypass security checks and gain elevated privileges by loading privileged URLs. The vulnerability was mitigated by enforcing the correct interpretation of relative URLs and implementing appropriate security checks.
