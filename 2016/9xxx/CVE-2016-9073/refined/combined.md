See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

[window-create.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8774583)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8774583&action=edit)

I've attached a WebExtension, that does this:
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
chrome.windows.create({
url: "popups/popup.html"
});
});
"popups/popup.html" is a path to a file packaged with the add-on. In Chrome, the document is loaded. In Firefox, A new window opens, and tries to load "<http://www.popups.com/popup.html>".

We don't currently do any resolution or security checks for these URLs. The most obvious problem this causes is that relative URLs don't work. But it also gives extensions the ability to load arbitrary URLs with the DANGEROUS\_TO\_LOAD flag, which is a much bigger problem.Assignee: nobody → kmaglione+bmoKeywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)Summary: chrome.windows.create doesn't work with relative paths → windows.create schema doesn't specify "format": "relativeUrl"

Resolve URLs passed to windows.create relative to the caller
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily, without further details about the bug.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
This patch does not, but the follow-up patch with additional security tests does.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All supported branches are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This patch should apply cleanly, or with minimal modification, to all non-ESR branches. ESR may require non-trivial modification.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not likely. The method that this changes is relatively well-tested, and the changes do not affect existing tests. Existing code should only be adversely affected if it is already passing illegal URLs, either maliciously or inadvertantly.

Add tests for attempted loads of unsafe URLs
This makes sense as far as testing that common URLs rejected by checkLoadURL() aren't valid parameters for windows.create(), but I don't really understand what URI\_DANGEROUS\_TO\_LOAD means and hence what the vulnerability in this is. So either a review by somebody who does understand or a more detailed explanation here would be good.

Resolve URLs passed to windows.create relative to the caller
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]: N/A
[User impact if declined]: This bug allows WebExtensions to load privileged URLs, and to potentially break out of their security sandbox.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TreeHerder]: The API that this change affects is covered by existing tests, and this patch adds additional tests for the changes. A separate patch adds tests for the security issues that this addresses.
[Risks and why]: Low. The method that this changes is relatively well-tested, and the changes do not affect existing tests. Existing code should only be adversely affected if it is already passing illegal URLs, either maliciously or inadvertantly.
[String/UUID change made/needed]: None.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open Firefox (tested on nightly and stable) and hit CTRL+SHIFT+B to open bookmark library.
2. Create new bookmark with the location of the base64 encoded data uri above.
3. Make sure to check 'load this bookmark in the sidebar' and add
4. Open a new tab then execute the bookmark, it should open on the side.
5. Open the web console of the new tab (to view the error)
6. Execute the following and observe behavior (by copy pasting it inside the textarea and pressing 'go'):
- alert(content) => Error: "Error: Permission denied to access property Symbol.toPrimitive" {file: "javascript:alert(content);void(0)" line: 1}]
@javascript:alert(content);void(0):1:1
- content.close() => [JavaScript Error: "Error: Permission denied to access property "close"" {file: "javascript:content.close();void(0)" line: 1}]
@javascript:content.close();void(0):1:1
- close.bind(content)() => [JavaScript Warning: "Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script." {file: "javascript:close.bind(content)();void(0)" line: 1}]
Note: The above javascript warning was displayed inside the console opened in newtab.
- var q = new mozRTCPeerConnection;q.createOffer(Map,close.bind(content)); => [JavaScript Warning: "Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script." {file: "about:newtab" line: 0}]
note: notice the file: that originated the error.
Actual results:
It seems like javascript is executed in the chrome context though so far I can only execute close(), blur() and focus()
Expected results:
Block script execution from content to chrome window.
The theory is that this could be used in the future to execute code in chrome context using other exploits.

What leads you to think this is the case? The document doesn't have the system principal AFAICT. It has a reference to the window currently loaded in the tab, which it can only access if it's same-origin with that thing. Note that 'content' is just defined on Window ( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/Window.webidl#397> ), so the reference also exists in the main content window itself. This is useful if the page in the sidebar \*is\* same-origin with the page you have open in the tab. AFAICT you're not actually successfully breaking the cross-compartment barrier between the sidebar and the main window content, nor does the JS-as-run have system privileges. Bobby or you can correct me if I'm missing something here.Flags: needinfo?(qab)Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Oh - and additionally, you could already use javascript: or data: URIs running in the content browser directly when creating those as bookmarks / bookmarklets, which is a broadly recognized feature-with-security-issues. So even if you could access the content from that sidebar I'm not sure I follow how that alone gains you anything over running javascript: URIs directly against the content window from a bookmark.

> What leads you to think this is the case? The document doesn't have the system principal AFAICT.
The main reason I think so is that when I directly access close or blur its blocked, using the other methods, it seems like it fires. Also the fact that the console shows a javascript error and claims the source of the error is 'about:newtab' brings me to the conclusion that there is some confusion going on.
>and additionally, you could already use javascript: or data: URIs running in the content browser directly when creating those as bookmarks / bookmarklets,
Bookmarketed javascript: urls dont work on privileged windows. I believe javascript: uris are blocked even if the user manually enters it in the address bar within a privileged window.
As far as I know you can't reproduce the behavior I mentioned using non-sidebar bookmarks on privileged windows.
Also, if you open a non-sidebar bookmark of a data: uri while a privileged window is open, it wont result in data: having any higher privileges, as its just content.

I guess its not that we have code running as chrome, but that non-chrome content is accessing (or at least executing) chrome functions which is not supposed to be the case.

Also, the only other way I'm aware of gaining a reference to a chrome owned window is to perform window.open() within a content and then having the user manually navigate to something like 'about:newtab' in the newly opened window. Which would give the same results as here.
Pretty much requires an equal amount of user interaction here.
So the only real question here is whether the behavior as far as executing close(),blur() and focus() is expected behavior or not. My argument is that a content window should never be able to effect a higher privileged window in any way.
So, is this behavior indicative of a potential bug in the future? I will leave that to you guys.

Well, no, it's executing content functions (you're using 'close' from the scope in which the JS is evaluated, ie content) which you've rebound onto chrome-privileged objects, and that then fails with something other than a security error, which is somewhat surprising. I believe the reasoning is that it's possible for web content to close windows it's opened, even when not same-content. It's surprising content.close() doesn't produce the same error as close.bind(content). On the web, "even" windowRef.close() works (irrespective of what's loaded in that window). I also verified that you can use the close rebinding from the sidebar on windows that \*were\* opened by script. That is:
1. open some website
2. in the web console, run e.g. w = window.open("<http://www.mozilla.org/>"); - you probably need to allow popups for this to work well and open a window;
3. open the sidebar bookmark from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window")
4. run 'close.bind(content)();'
will close the tab. That's a lot of effort/specificity for a dos-type issue though...
I think it would make sense if .bind, .call, .apply and friends did a cross-compartment check on arguments, but I don't know if that would be a web-breaking change. Bobby or Boris can likely comment as to whether that's feasible.
Do the blur and focus calls actually do anything? I don't see any user-visible changes, but maybe I'm missing something?
Anyway, all of these would be Core/DOM changes... we can move the bug, but equally I'm not sure to what degree we think sidebars are special here (cf [comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window")) and if there's something we should do in the Firefox front-end to disallow this. We could prevent data/js URIs from loading in the sidebar, but I don't know if that would actually accomplish anything security-wise.

Interesting example. I always assumed that only windows that opened another window (through open()) were able to close tabs. But seems like any window can close a window thats been opened by some other window.
>Do the blur and focus calls actually do anything? I don't see any user-visible changes, but maybe I'm missing something?
I know focus() does, you can test this by reproducing the steps in [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window") (with focus instead of close) and just make your firefox window smaller so that you can see the scrollbars inside the newtab window. Once you execute the focus.blur immediately hit the down arrow key and you will see that you're focused in the newtab.
To test the opposite just click anywhere in the sidebar and try hitting the down arrow and you wont be focused on newtab but rather the sidebar.
So we know these functions are being executed/accessed to an extent.

So, here are some general points from a 100-ft view:
\* As defense-in-depth, we want to avoid allowing untrusted content to get a reference to a chrome window, even though there's no security issue with that per se.
\* There are additional levels of mitigation here if the this is only accessible from code executed in the bookmark sidebar. Still worth avoiding if we can though.
\* Chrome Window / Location objects do not expose the usual cross-origin methods. However, as Abdulrahman correctly points you, you can still call/apply cross-origin getters to it, because methods marked with the [CrossOrigin\*] attributes in webidl do an unconditional unwrap of any security wrapper around |this|. This is probably worth fixing as defense-in-depth, and wouldn't be hard - we just need to replace the UncheckedUnwrap call at [1] with a slightly-smarter helper method that fails if the helper method is not a CrossOriginXrayWrapper instance. Should be a quick patch and extremely unlikely to break anything.
\* I don't think it's useful to mess around with adding security checks to bind/call/apply. The above fix should be sufficient.
In summary, the two things to do with this bug are:
\* Investigate if there's any way we're exposing a chrome window reference to untrusted content, and eliminate it if it's practical.
\* Tighten down the usage of cross-origin-accessible accessors per the suggestion above.

You mean if something being unwrapped is not.
Can we just check the flags that UncheckedUnwrap (optionally) outputs, or is the state we care about not reflected in those flags?

Right.

> the state we care about not reflected in those flags?
It is not reflected precisely, but we could pretty easily do that. Though we could actually just check for IS\_XRAY\_WRAPPER\_FLAG (which is reflected), which is probably good enough.
That might be more complicated than we need though. We still need to check whether the thing is a wrapper at all, since if it's not then the flags won't be there. So we basically want the code to do this:
if (IsCrossCompartmentWrapper(obj) && !IsXrayWrapper(obj)) {
// throw
}
obj = UncheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);

No, because we don't want to throw for a transparent CCW, right?
The right thing might be more like:
if (IsXrayWrapper(obj)) {
obj = UncheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);
} else {
obj = CheckedUnwrap(obj, /\* stopAtOuter = \*/ false);
}
if (!obj) {
// security error, throw.
}

Does this effectively mean making window.content return null if the window it points to is chrome privileged, or am I misreading you and/or is there a better way to do this?Group: firefox-core-security → core-securityComponent: Untriaged → DOMFlags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)Product: Firefox → Core

IIUC the issue here is that we have a content docshell with a chrome window which embeds a content window as an iframe. Is that right, or am I misunderstanding the situation?
In general it seems better to avoid having chrome windows in content docshells. But perhaps that's unavoidable here?Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Close, but not quite.
The sidebar in browser.xul has a <browser> (id=sidebar, no type attribute, so AIUI it ends up being a type=chrome browser - document.getElementById("sidebar").frameLoader.docShell.itemType returns 0) which loads <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/web-panels.xul> which is a privileged page ("chrome window"). That page itself has another XUL <browser> (type=content) that loads the webpage (so yes, kind of like an iframe). The webpage that's loaded in the sidebar is content-privileged, it has the data: URI from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window").
However, it has a reference to the webpage loaded \*in the browser for the current tab\* - which is in a separate part of the document tree (ie not anywhere under the browser#sidebar I started this explanation with). Because the main tabbrowser is type=primary-content, that's what "window.content" refers to in anything under the browser.xul-based docshell tree. It is that primary-content browser that has a chrome-privileged page in, in some cases, such as about:newtab or about:preferences or about:config, etc. etc. (basically any about: page that doesn't have URI\_SAFE\_FOR\_UNTRUSTED\_CONTENT that you load in a tab).
> In general it seems better to avoid having chrome windows in content

It's just software, right? ;-)
We do this for a number of about: pages that are chrome privileged. So to avoid this, we would either:
1) make the docshell we load them in non-content
2) make the pages unprivileged/non-chrome.
For (1), changing the type attribute of the browser and reinserting it into the DOM (without which the type attribute change has no effect) whenever we load a chrome-privileged page would likely lead to functional bugs because the XBL binding state gets lost that way, so that doesn't seem very attractive. Though, to be completely fair, we have some code for this type of thing for when we switch between remote/non-remote browsers (e.g. about:preferences loads in the parent process, webpages don't, and so we do all kinds of evil switches when you back/forward through history/navigation between those things). That code has "issues", but we could potentially look into this if we thought that was actually feasible and important.
For (2), I believe people are working to make about:newtab unprivileged on and off. It hasn't been a priority compared to a lot of other things people want to change about about:newtab. Even if we did that, though, the same problem would continue for things like about:preferences, about:debugging, and about:config, which are much harder to make unprivileged.
TL;DR: this feels like it would be difficult

Is this at all fixable in the DOM/bindings layer? As in, can we just proxy in a null-ish object for any case where the referring item is content-privileged / in a content-privileged compartment, and the referred-to item is chrome-privileged?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Err, I meant content-primary.

Ok - I don't think it's worth it given that this only happens within the bookmark bar. The Xray thing should probably be sufficient.Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Which "this"?
The proposal up in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window") to [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1281071#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sidebar bookmark can have reference to chrome window") is to make it so if you have a window reference from non-chrome stuff to a chrome-privileged window then any property access on it throws \_and\_ using your own DOM methods/getters/setters with it as "this" also throws. We already do the former; we would add the latter.
Past that, I'm not sure what the proposal is, exactly, for binding stuff.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
