The provided content relates to CVE-2016-9596.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a stack exhaustion issue in `libxml2` while parsing XML files in recovery mode.
- This was a regression introduced due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2016-3627 in Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack exhaustion in `libxml2` when parsing XML files in recovery mode.
- Incomplete or incorrect fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2016-3627) in Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to stack consumption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Parsing specially crafted XML files in recovery mode can cause stack exhaustion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML file to be parsed by a vulnerable application using `libxml2`.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE was assigned because the original issue (CVE-2016-3627) was listed as fixed in RHSA-2016:2957 for Red Hat JBoss Core Services, but the fix was not properly applied. Therefore, this CVE is specific to Red Hat JBoss Core Services.
- The vulnerability was fixed by rebasing `libxml2` to version 2.9.7 in JBCS 2.4.29 (RHSA-2018:2486).
