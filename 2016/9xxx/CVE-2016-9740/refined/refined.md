- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM QRadar SIEM does not properly restrict the size or amount of resources that are requested or influenced by an actor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient restriction of the size or amount of requested resources, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can consume all resources on the server, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction. They can be a remote, unauthenticated attacker.
