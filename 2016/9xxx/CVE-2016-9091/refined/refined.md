Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-9091:

**Vulnerability 1: OS Command Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The Blue Coat ASG and CAS management consoles are vulnerable to OS command injection via the Report Email functionality.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper input sanitization in the Report Email feature allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated malicious administrator can execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the `tomcat` user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/avenger/rest/report-email/send` endpoint. The request must include a malicious payload in the `url` parameter of the JSON data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges on the Blue Coat ASG or CAS system.

**Vulnerability 2: Local Privilege Escalation**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists within the `mvtroubleshooting.sh` script that allows privilege escalation from the `tomcat` user to `root`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `mvtroubleshooting.sh` script can be used to overwrite files as root because it is executed with `sudo` privileges by the tomcat user and does not properly validate the input file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A local user with `tomcat` privileges can gain root access on the system, allowing complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A local attacker with `tomcat` privileges can exploit the vulnerability by writing a malicious executable to a temporary location, then using `mvtroubleshooting.sh` to overwrite the `/etc/init.d/nscd` script with that malicious executable, and then execute it as root by using the `flush_dns.sh` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and have gained initial access as the `tomcat` user. The tomcat user must also have `sudo` privileges to run `/opt/bluecoat/avenger/scripts/mv_troubleshooting.sh` without a password.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Blue Coat CAS versions prior to 1.3.7.4 and ASG versions prior to 6.6.5.4 are vulnerable.
*   **Vendor Advisory:** The vendor's security advisory can be found at `https://bto.bluecoat.com/security-advisory/sa138`.
*   **Metasploit Modules:** Metasploit modules are available for both vulnerabilities: a remote command injection module and a local privilege escalation module.
