Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from calling phpMyAdmin scripts in an unexpected way. This triggers PHP error messages that disclose the full path of the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- Specifically, during an execution timeout in the export functionality, these errors (containing the full path) are written to the export file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerability. The application reveals the server's internal directory structure, which can aid attackers in reconnaissance for further exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can learn the full path of the phpMyAdmin installation directory by examining the error messages. This information can be used in further attacks by knowing the location of files that might have other vulnerabilities

**Attack vectors:**
- By calling specific phpMyAdmin scripts unexpectedly and triggering a PHP error.
- Causing an execution timeout during export operations to have the full path written to the export file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the phpMyAdmin application and trigger specific conditions. This can likely be done remotely.
- No authentication is mentioned as being necessary, meaning that unauthenticated users may trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The phpMyAdmin security advisory (PMASA-2016-63) marks this as a non-critical vulnerability, and is related to the export functionality and some unexpected ways of calling scripts that generates PHP errors, exposing the server path.
- The issue is identified by CWE-661 (Incorrect Access Control).
