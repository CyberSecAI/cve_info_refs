| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c0)  Bharti Kundal    2016-12-22 20:34:19 UTC  ``` It was found that Red Hat JBoss Core Services incorrectly included [CVE-2016-3705](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3705) as resolved in Apache HTTP 2.4.23 (erratum RHSA-2016:2957). The release did not include the fix to libxml2, leaving it vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to a Stack Overflow. This is a regression CVE for [CVE-2016-3705](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3705).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2016-12-22 20:45:02 UTC  ```  Are there any details available for this? Upsteam bug, commit reference?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c3)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-03 11:03:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Salvatore Bonaccorso from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c2)) >  Are there any details available for this? Upsteam bug, commit reference?  Referring to [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408302#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=1408302#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9596 libxml2: stack exhaustion while parsing xml files in recovery mode (unfixed CVE-2016-3627 in JBCS)")   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2017-01-12 06:19:10 UTC  ``` Hi Adam  Thanks for the information here and in the related bugs. I guess there is though some confusion around the CVEs. E.g. then SuSE is tracking that CVE for <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017497> .  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c5)  Adam Mariš    2017-01-16 14:55:58 UTC  ``` > Thanks for the information here and in the related bugs. I guess there is > though some confusion around the CVEs. E.g. then SuSE is tracking that CVE > for <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017497> .  Thank you for notifying us about that, Salvatore. I put the comment in Suse bugzilla:  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1017497#c18>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2017-02-23 17:25:35 UTC  ``` This CVE id is for the same issue as [CVE-2016-3705](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3705) ([bug 1332443](show_bug.cgi?id=1332443 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-3705 libxml2: stack overflow before detecting invalid XML file")).  This additional CVE was assigned because the original issue was listed as fixed in RHSA-2016:2957 for the Red Hat JBoss Core Services:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2957.html>  However, that erratum actually failed to include the fix for the issue.  Therefore, this new CVE is specific to the Red Hat JBoss Core Services product and is better described as: missing/incorrect fix for [CVE-2016-3705](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-3705) in the Red Hat JBoss Core Services.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c17)  Tanaya Patil    2018-08-30 09:47:55 UTC  ``` Hi,  Waiting for a fix on this CVE. As the bug status is still 'NEW', would like to know if we getting the complete fix for this CVE. If yes please share when.  Thanks, Tanaya   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c19)  Timothy Walsh    2018-09-05 04:16:09 UTC  ``` JBCS 2.4.29 RHSA-2018:2486 includes rebased libxml2 to 2.9.7 which addresses this CVE and [CVE-2016-9596](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9596).   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c20)  Tanaya Patil    2018-11-26 10:29:21 UTC  ``` Can anyone please specify the version in which this issue is fixed or mention it in the "target milestone" field?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c21)  Adam Mariš    2018-11-26 14:58:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tanaya Patil from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1408305#c20)) > Can anyone please specify the version in which this issue is fixed or > mention it in the "target milestone" field?  It seems the previous comment already answers your question, doesn't it?   ``` |  |
