- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow in the `path` variable within the `hyprlofs_ioctl` function when processing `HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES` commands on native file systems. This occurs due to an incorrect bounds check where a length equal to `MAXPATHLEN` is allowed, followed by a null byte write at `path[e[i].hle_plen]`, which results in a one-byte out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to an off-by-one error in the length check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - The vulnerability is triggered through the `ioctl` system call with the `HYPRLOFS_ADD_ENTRIES` command.
  - An attacker needs to craft a malicious input with `e[i].hle_plen` equal to `MAXPATHLEN`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs the ability to make ioctl calls to the `hyprlofs` filesystem, and have at least low privileges to perform the operation.
