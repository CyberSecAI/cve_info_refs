{
  "cve": "CVE-2016-9594",
  "description": "curl before version 7.52.1 is vulnerable to an uninitialized random in libcurl's internal function that returns a good 32bit random value. Having a weak or virtually non-existent random value makes the operations that use it vulnerable.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "curl < 7.52.1"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The libcurl's internal function that returns a random value was implemented poorly and overwrote the pointer instead of writing the value into the buffer the pointer pointed to. The random value is uninitialized.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Uninitialized random value"
  ],
  "impact": "A weak or non-existent random value makes operations using this random value vulnerable, such as nonces for Digest and NTLM authentication, and boundary strings in HTTP formposts.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Network attacks"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through network communication if the affected versions are used by a client or server application. ",
  "patch": "Fixed in curl 7.52.1"
}
