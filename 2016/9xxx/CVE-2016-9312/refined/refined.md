Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-9312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The ntpd service on Windows does not properly handle oversized UDP packets. Specifically, it fails to process the packet correctly when it is larger than expected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient resource pool (CWE-410).
- Improper handling of oversized UDP packets leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A crafted oversized UDP packet sent to a vulnerable ntpd instance on Windows causes the service to stop working, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted oversized UDP packet to the vulnerable ntpd server on a Windows system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the target ntpd server. No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send oversized UDP packets.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the Windows version of ntpd.
- The issue was resolved in ntpd version 4.2.8p9 and later.
- Mitigation strategies include implementing BCP-38, firewall rules to block oversized NTP packets, and monitoring/auto-restarting ntpd if it crashes.
