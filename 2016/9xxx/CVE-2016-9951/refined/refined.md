    "information": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Apport related to the handling of `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields in a crash file. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from Apport executing the `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields when a user clicks the \"Restart\" button in the apport-gtk interface. This was intended behavior, but it creates a risk when a user opens a malicious crash file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The `RespawnCommand` and `ProcCmdline` fields of a crash file can contain arbitrary commands that are executed when the user clicks \"Restart\".\n- The \"Restart\" option is offered even when opening a crash file from an untrusted source, allowing attackers to trigger arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the malicious crash file.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is to craft a malicious `.crash` file with crafted `RespawnCommand` or `ProcCmdline` fields and trick a user into opening it.\n- This can be done via social engineering methods, like embedding the malicious .crash file in a website or email.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .crash file.\n- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious crash file.\n\nThe provided content gives more details than the official CVE description, explaining the attack vector, the vulnerable fields and the steps that lead to code execution."
