    "description": "Multiple flaws have been discovered in libtiff. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code by tricking an application linked against libtiff into processing specially crafted files. (CVE-2016-9533, CVE-2016-9534, CVE-2016-9535)\n* Multiple flaws have been discovered in various libtiff tools (tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffcp, bmp2tiff). By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a crash or memory corruption and, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the libtiff tool.

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Predictor function of the libtiff library, specifically related to horizontal differencing. Assertions were used, which can lead to assertion failures in debug mode or buffer overflows in release mode. This is triggered when processing images with unusual tile sizes, particularly YCbCr with subsampling.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow due to inadequate size checks.",
        "Missing runtime validation."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a crash or memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by processing a specially crafted TIFF file. This occurs within applications that are linked against the vulnerable libtiff library.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through specially crafted TIFF image files. An attacker needs to trick a user or an application into processing such a malicious file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malformed TIFF file. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
