Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in multiple integer overflows within the `libwebp` library, specifically when processing GIF images using the `gifdec.c` example program. The vulnerable functions are `GIFReadFrame()`, `ClearRectangle()`, and `GIFBlendFrames()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflows:** The code used integer types (specifically 'int') for calculations involving image dimensions and pixel strides. When the width, height, and stride of a GIF image are large, these calculations could overflow, leading to memory corruption. Specifically, calculations like `ptr + j * stride` were vulnerable when `stride` was an 'int'.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** The code used pointer arithmetic with potentially overflowing integer values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By processing a specially crafted GIF file, an attacker could trigger the integer overflows, leading to a crash of the `gif2webp` tool, causing a denial of service.
- **Unspecified Impacts:** The security advisory from Gentoo mentions "other unspecified impacts" which suggests the possibility of more severe consequences like memory corruption or potentially remote code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted GIF Files:** An attacker needs to create a malicious GIF image with specific dimensions and properties that would cause the integer overflows when processed by `gif2webp`.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to entice a user to process this crafted GIF using the vulnerable version of the `gif2webp` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability lies in how the software handles data, not in the network stack itself.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs technical skills to create GIF files that will trigger the overflows.
- **Social Engineering/Distribution:** The attacker needs a means to get the user to process the crafted GIF. This may involve social engineering, sending the file in an email, or hosting it on a website.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves using wider `size_t` types instead of integers in the calculations. It also employs pointer increments `(ptr += stride)` when possible to avoid potentially overflowing integer math when calculating memory offsets.
*   The vulnerability affects `libwebp` versions prior to 0.5.2.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 included a patched version of `libwebp` that resolved this vulnerability in the initial 1.0.0 release.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `examples/gifdec.c` file which is part of the libwebp source code distribution.
