Based on the provided information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-9685

**Content Classification:** The provided content is related to CVE-2016-9685.

**Summary:**

This CVE addresses a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's XFS file system attribute handling, specifically within `xfs_attr_shortform_list` and `xfs_attr3_leaf_list_int` functions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the specified XFS attribute listing functions. Specifically, in case of an error during attribute listing, the allocated memory `sbuf` or `args.value` was not freed, causing a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak in the XFS attribute handling code due to failure to free allocated memory in certain error paths of functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly triggering the memory leak, an attacker could potentially exhaust the system's available memory leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A local user with the ability to interact with the XFS file system could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Through Docker**: As indicated in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry, the issue can be triggered when using a docker container backed by xfs/overlay2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on a system with a vulnerable kernel and the ability to interact with the XFS file system, particularly operations that list file attributes.
*   **Ability to trigger specific operations:** The attacker needs to trigger operations that cause errors in the functions `xfs_attr_shortform_list` or `xfs_attr3_leaf_list_int`, which will cause the memory leak.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves adding `kmem_free(sbuf)` before the error return in `xfs_attr_shortform_list` and adding `kmem_free(args.value)` after calling `context->put_listent` in `xfs_attr3_leaf_list_int` to ensure the allocated memory is freed when there's an error.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:1842 and RHSA-2017:2077) indicates the patch was applied to RHEL 7.
* The fix was also backported to MRG 2 (RHSA-2017:2669)
