Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the Adobe Connect online web application and v9.5.6 Windows software. Specifically, the `firstname`, `lastname`, and `companyname` parameters of the `event_registration.html` file's POST method request are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS. Malicious script code can be injected into the vulnerable parameters. This injected script executes within the context of the application when the data is displayed in emails sent by the service.
- **Input Validation Failure:** The application fails to properly validate and filter user-supplied input in the registration form, allowing injection of arbitrary script code.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application does not encode the input values when they are included in the email body, enabling the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking.
- **Persistent Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could launch persistent phishing attacks by injecting malicious links or content.
- **Persistent Redirects:** Attackers could redirect users to external, malicious sites.
- **Manipulation of Service Context:** Attackers could manipulate the affected or connected service modules. This could affect the webinar links with injected credentials resulting in a second persistent script code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Web-based Attack:** The attack is performed via the web interface by injecting malicious script code.
- **POST Request Manipulation:** The attack involves injecting malicious script code within the parameters of a POST request to `event_registration.html`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege Web-Application User Account:** The attacker does not need high privileges.
- **Low User Interaction:** Minimal user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Access to Adobe Connect instance:** The attacker needs to access the Adobe Connect webinar registration form.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `firstname`, `lastname`, and `companyname` parameters of the `event_registration.html` file submit POST method request.
- The injected script code is executed within the email body context of the `admin@adobeconnect.com` email address.
- The vulnerability can also be triggered when following the webinar links with injected credentials.
