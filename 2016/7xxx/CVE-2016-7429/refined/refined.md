  "CVE-2016-7429": {
    "description": "When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a different interface than was used for the request, the peer structure is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on a host with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating system doesn't check source address in received packets (e.g. rp_filter on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source can send a packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to select wrong interface for the source and prevent it from sending new requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed, which happens on routing changes or every 5 minutes by default. If the attack is repeated often enough (once per second), ntpd will not be able to synchronize with the source.",
    "root_cause": "The ntpd daemon incorrectly updates the peer structure with the interface from which a response is received instead of using the interface from which the original request was sent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Multiple Binds to the Same Port"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by preventing ntpd from synchronizing with a source.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Spoofed source address"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the address of a valid NTP source and be able to send spoofed packets to the ntpd server."
