# Update your Apple Watch

You can get the latest version of watchOS directly on your Apple Watch, or use your iPhone to update.

## Check your Apple Watch compatibility

First, make sure that your Apple Watch works with the latest software. watchOS 11 is compatible with these Apple Watch models:

* Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)
* Apple Watch Series 6 and later
* Apple Watch Ultra and later

Not all watchOS 11 features are available on all devices.

Updating to watchOS 11 requires iPhone XS or later with iOS 18.

If your Apple Watch isn't compatible with the latest version of watchOS, Software Update will show you the newest version that your watch can use.

Identify which [Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/108056) or [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/108044) model you have.

## Get ready to update

Next, check these things:

1. Make sure that your [iPhone is updated to the latest version of iOS](https://support.apple.com/118575).
2. Make sure that your [Apple Watch is at least 50 percent charged](https://support.apple.com/108760).
3. Make sure that your [iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.apple.com/111107).

Keep your iPhone near your Apple Watch throughout the update. It could take from several minutes to an hour for the update to complete, so you might want to update overnight or wait until you have time.

## Update your Apple Watch using your iPhone

You can wait until Apple Watch notifies you when a new update is available. Tap Update Tonight in the notification, then go to your iPhone to confirm that you want to update overnight. At the end of the day, leave your Apple Watch and iPhone charging overnight so the update can complete.

Or you can update your Apple Watch with your iPhone manually:

1. On your iPhone, open the Apple Watch app, then tap the My Watch tab.
2. Tap General > Software Update.

   ![ios-16-iphone-13-pro-watchos-9-settings-general-software-update-available](https://cdsassets.apple.com/live/7WUAS350/images/apple-pay/ios-16-iphone-13-pro-watchos-9-settings-general-software-update-available.png)
3. Download the update. If asked for your iPhone passcode or Apple Watch passcode, enter it.
4. Wait for the progress wheel to appear on your Apple Watch. It could take from several minutes to an hour for the update to complete.

Leave your Apple Watch on its charger while the update completes. Don't restart your iPhone or Apple Watch, and don't quit the Apple Watch app. When the update completes, your Apple Watch restarts on its own.

## Update directly on your Apple Watch

If your Apple Watch has watchOS 6 or later, you can install updates without your iPhone:

1. Make sure that your [watch is connected to Wi-Fi](https://support.apple.com/111818).
2. On your watch, open the Settings app.
3. Tap General > Software Update.
4. Tap Install if a software update is available, then follow the onscreen instructions.

Leave your Apple Watch on its charger while the update completes, and don't restart your Apple Watch. When the update completes, your Apple Watch restarts on its own.

## Some iPhone updates might require that you update your Apple Watch

It's important to keep your Apple devices up to date so that they have the latest bug fixes and security enhancements.

Some iOS updates on your iPhone require that you also update watchOS on your Apple Watch. So if you see an alert on your iPhone that says "Update Apple Watch" and "Your Apple Watch software is out of date," you should update to the latest version of watchOS so that your data, including Activity data, continues to sync to your iPhone.

## Need more help with updating?

Try these steps:

1. Make sure that your Apple Watch is [connecting properly to its charger](https://support.apple.com/108927).
2. [Restart your Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/apd521a8a902).
3. [Restart your paired iPhone](https://support.apple.com/118259).
4. Try again to update your Apple Watch.

If the update won't start:

1. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
2. Tap General > Storage.
3. Delete the update file.
4. Try again to update your Apple Watch.

Learn what to do [if you see 'Cannot Install Update' when updating Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/102407) or [if your Apple Watch says you need more available storage](https://support.apple.com/102407) to install a watchOS update.

### If you installed an iOS or watchOS beta or developer seed

If you installed beta software on your iPhone or Apple Watch, you need to remove the beta profile before you can update to the next major software version:

* Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, tap the My Watch tab, then go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile that you want to remove, then tap Delete Profile. Enter your iPhone passcode if requested.
* Open the Settings app on your iPhone, then tap General > Profiles & Device Management. Tap the beta profile that you want to remove, then tap Delete profile. Enter your iPhone passcode if requested.

After you remove the profiles, restart both devices and check for the update again.

iOS 10.1.x Remote memory corruption through certificate file
Credit: Maksymilian Arciemowicz from https://cxsecurity.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Short description
Special crafted certificate file may lead to memory corruption of several processes and the vector attack may be through Mobile Safari or Mail app. Attacker may control the overflow through the certificate length in OCSP field

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Possible vectors of attack
- Apple Mail (double click on certificate)
- Safari Mobile ( go to special crafted link eg https://cert.cx/appleios10/700k.php which will redirect you to CRT file )
- other unspecified

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Symptoms of memory overflow
By appropriate length of the certificate, an attacker can trigger crash of:
- profiled
- Preferences
- other unexpected behaviors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Safari and sandbox
How is possible that safari don't ask user before run 'Preferences' app to start process of importing certificate? Safari automatically start new process without asking user for acceptance of this operation what can be exploited through http redirect to untrusted content.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
