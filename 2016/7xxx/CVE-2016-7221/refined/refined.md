Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows Input Method Editor (IME) improperly handling DLL loading. Specifically, it appears that the IME loads DLLs from insecure locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The IME fails to properly validate the source of DLLs before loading them. This allows a malicious actor to introduce a rogue DLL, which the IME will then load. This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploitation can lead to an elevation of privilege. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with elevated system privileges because the IME runs with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A locally authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application. The attacker needs to have an account on the target system, but it does not need to be an administrator account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires the ability to log on to the target system. 
- **Ability to run applications:** The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
- The provided document mentions a fix by "correcting how the Windows Input Method Editor (IME) loads DLLs."
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The exploitability assessment for the vulnerability is "1 - Exploitation More Likely". This means that the vulnerability is more likely to be exploited in the 30 days following the release of the security bulletin.
- This vulnerability is addressed in the MS16-130 security update.
- The vulnerability can be exploited only when the IME is installed on the system. If IME is not present on the system, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
