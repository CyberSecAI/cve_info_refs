{
  "CVE-2016-7797": {
    "description": "Pacemaker before 1.1.15, when using pacemaker remote, might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (node disconnection) via an unauthenticated connection.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the pacemaker_remote service allows a new, unauthenticated client connection to kill existing connections. This occurs before a valid authkey is provided for the new connection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of client connections",
        "Lack of proper authentication for client takeover"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by disconnecting a pacemaker_remote node from the cluster. This can disrupt the availability of resources managed by Pacemaker.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network connection to the pacemaker_remote service's TCP port (typically 3121)",
        "Unauthenticated connection attempt"
      ],
        "required_capabilities": [
           "Ability to establish a TCP connection to the pacemaker_remote service",
           "No authentication required"
       ]
    },
    "additional_details": {
       "fix_details": "The fix introduces a check to ensure the handshake is complete before notifying other clients of a new connection.",
         "affected_versions": "Pacemaker versions before 1.1.15" ,
