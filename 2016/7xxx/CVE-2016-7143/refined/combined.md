*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Subject: CVE ID request: certificate spoofing through crafted SASL message in inspircd, charybdis

inspircd published 2.0.23 that fixes an issue with SASL
authentication. The details are here:

<http://www.inspircd.org/2016/09/03/v2023-released.html>

All versions are affected.

Upstream hasn't requested a CVE yet. I told them I would request one
from here on IRC.

It seems to also affect Charybdis, which fixed the issue in the
upcoming 3.5.3 release:

<https://github.com/charybdis-ircd/charybdis/commit/818a3fda944b26d4814132cee14cfda4ea4aa824>

by **[Syzop](./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=9&sid=a7d94c935952b9958bec378fb4e9ad64)** » Sat Sep 03, 2016 7:05 pm

A security issue was detected in a number of IRCd's, including UnrealIRCd, regarding the way SASL is implemented.

If you use services and have SASL enabled (you need to do this explicitly) then you should patch or upgrade as soon as possible.

While this only affects 2% of our userbase, for those networks which are affected this is a very serious issue. If you are affected you can upgrade to one of the new UnrealIRCd releases or you can upgrade their existing UnrealIRCd without a restart (see below)

UPDATE: You can use our [online security check](https://www.unrealircd.org/check_sasl.php) to see if your server is vulnerable or not!

Note that releases and this security announcement have been made in a hurry. Details on this issue are already available online at other websites.

Issue details

An attacker can send an SSL fingerprint of his choice to services when doing SASL authentication. An attacker can compromise a services account if the user has an SSL fingerprint stored in services.

How to check if you are affected (how do I know if I use SASL?)

You are only affected if ALL of the following 3 conditions are true:

* SASL is enabled in UnrealIRCd: check if set::sasl-server is set to a valid server
* Your services support SASL (eg: anope)
* Your services support SSL fingerprint authentication (eg: anope)

How to get the fix/patch?

Windows users should download and install UnrealIRCd 4.0.6 or 3.2.10.7.

Linux/BSD/.. users can also install 4.0.6 / 3.2.10.7 OR you can choose to patch UnrealIRCd on-the-fly without a restart.

Since the patch is usually the easiest and most user friendly solution, we recommend it.

Run the following on the IRC shell:

Code: Select all

```
wget http://www.unrealircd.org/patch/saslpatcher && sh saslpatcher
```

Q&A

**Have there been any reports of these bugs being abused by anyone?**

We don't know. It sounds likely, the issue is very easy to exploit.

**Should I upgrade?**

If you use SASL authentication then yes you should definitely upgrade. If you do not have SASL enabled then there is no need to upgrade at this time, this is true for most of our users (98%).

**Are there any workarounds so I don't have to upgrade?**

As a very quick workaround you could disable SASL entirely by removing the set::sasl-server setting and rehashing the IRCd.

You could also disable SASL at the services level. For anope you do this by unloading the m\_sasl module (in anope).

**Can I upgrade without restarting the IRC server?**

On Windows no, but on Linux/BSD/.. yes you can. Run the following on the shell:

Code: Select all

```
wget http://www.unrealircd.org/patch/saslpatcher && sh saslpatcher
```

**How serious are these bugs?**

See the Issue details above. If you are affected then all user accounts with an SSL fingerprint for authentication can be compromised.

**I don't trust the patch script. Where can I download a .patch or unidiff?**

[https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealirc ... 4a766.diff](https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd/commit/f473e355e1dc422c4f019dbf86bc50ba1a34a766.diff)

**When was this issue reported?**

We received an email regarding this issue, but by the time it was read (90 minutes later) details were already published online. This UnrealIRCd release, patch and security announcement were thus made in a hurry and were sent out 2 hours later.

## charybdis-3.5.1

### misc

* Backport various ssld IPC improvements from master.

## charybdis-3.5.0

### server protocol

  unsetting the umode after connection).
* Fix a remote-triggerable crash triggered by the CAPAB parsing code.
* As per the TS6 spec, require QS and ENCAP capabilities.
* Require EX and IE capabilities (+e and +I cmodes).
* Check that UIDs start with the server's SID.

* If MONITOR is not enabled, don't advertise it in 005.
* Add starttls as per ircv3.
* Abort a whowas listing when it would exceed SendQ, which would previously
  disconnect the user.

* Remove CHARSET=ascii from ISUPPORT
* Use the normal rules for IP visibility in /whowas.
* Cmode +c now strips '\x0F' (^O, formatting off), fixing weird rendering in
  some clients that internally use mIRC formatting such as highlighted
  messages in HexChat.

  as we do when the user is set +g.
* Implement IRCv3.2 capabilities:
  + cap-notify

  + userhost-in-names
* Implement the $&amp;, $| and $m extban types:
  + $& combines 1 or more child extbans as an AND expression
  + $| combines 1 or more child extbans as an OR expression
  + $m provides normal hostmask matching as an extban for the above
* Do not allow STARTTLS if a connection is already using TLS.
* Display an operator's privilege set in WHOIS.
* The $o extban now matches against privilege set names as well as individual
  privileges. Privilege set names are preferred over individual privileges.

  SU/RSFNC/NICKDELAY/SVSLOGIN.
* Turn off umode +p (override) when deopering.
* Make listener error messages (e.g. port already in use) visible by default
  instead of only on snomask +d and in ioerrorlog.
* Remove snotes on +r about GET/PUT/POST commands ("HTTP Proxy disconnected").
* Add DNSBL snotes on snomask +r.

### config

* Add hide\_uncommon\_channels extension to hide uncommon channel memberships in WHOIS,
  like in ircd-seven.
* Add chm\_nonotice extension, cmode +T to reject notices.
* Add restrict-unauthenticated extension, prevents unauthenticated users from
  doing anything as channel operator.
* Add no\_kill\_services extension, prevents local opers from killing services.
* Allow matching specific replies of DNSBLs, using the new matches option.
* Remove blowfish crypt since it has the BSD advertising clause.
* Fix SHA256 ($5$) crypt.
* Make the channel::channel\_target\_change option actually work (it used to be
  always on).

* Fix reconnecting with SSL/TLS with some clients such as ChatZilla (see
  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858394#c34> for details.)
* Improve error messages about the configuration file.
* Fix a crash when compiled with recent clang on 32-bit systems.
* Fix various memory leaks in rehash.
* Fix various code quality issues.

  sqlite library. Using this is not recommended for on-server compilation.
* ISUPPORT tokens which are actually provided by modules have been moved to their
  respective modules.

## charybdis-3.4.0

### server protocol

* Allow overriding opers (with the new extension) to op themselves on channels.
* Allow RSFNC to change a nickname's capitalization only.
* Add channel ban forwarding $ much like ircd-seven. Local use
  of this is controlled by the channel::use\_forward config option.
* Add ENCAP TGINFO to propagate IP addresses that exceeded target change
  limits (these get a lower limit when they reconnect).

### user

* Consider bogus CTCP ACTION messages (without action text) CTCP (for
  cmode +C).
* Send ERR\_TOOMANYCHANNELS for each channel join that fails due to channel
  limits.
* Add account-notify client capability to notify clients about logins and
  logouts of users in common channels. See doc/account-notify.txt.
* Add extended-join client capability to add account name and ircname to JOIN.
* Add topic TS and channel TS constraints for /LIST (T<, T>, C<, C>
  parameters as in some other servers).
* Disallow wildcarded nicknames in "hunted" parameters like /stats and /motd.
* Disallow mIRC italics in channel names when disable\_fake\_channels.
* Add AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL support, allows SASL authentication using a
  certificate fingerprint.
* Allow channel::kick\_on\_split\_riding to protect channels with mlocked keys.
* The NICKLEN token in 005 now only specifies the maximum usable nick length.
  The MAXNICKLEN token specifies the maximum nick length any user can have.
* Disallow $ in usernames as this may cause problems with ban forwarding.
* Add an error message (numeric 743) if a ban mask is invalid.
* Extract the underlying IPv4 address from 6to4 and Teredo IPv6 addresses.
  Show it in a remote /whois and check channel bans, quiets, D:lines and
  K:lines against it. Note that ban exceptions and auth{} blocks are not
  checked.
* Allow normal users to perform /privs on themselves, showing some privileges
  from the auth{} block.
* Add away-notify client capability, see doc/away-notify.txt.
* Add rate limit for high-bandwidth commands, in particular /who .
* Rate limit /away to help avoid flooding via away-notify.
* Apply colour stripping (cmode +c) and CTCP checking (cmode +C) to messages
  to @/+ channel as well.
* Channel mode +c (and other places that disallow colour codes) now also strip
  ASCII 4 (a different kind of colour code).

### oper

* Add operspy for /list.
* Add a server notice to snomask +b if a user exceeds target change limits.
* Add missing server notice for kills from RSFNC and SVSLOGIN.
* Add /stats C to show information about dynamically loaded server
  capabilities.

### config

* Add support for linking using SSL certificate fingerprints as the link
  credential rather than the traditional password pair.
* Add m\_roleplay extension, provides various roleplay commands.
* Add override extension, umode +p oper override for opers with oper:override
  permission, with accountability notices and timeout. Note that opers cannot
  op themselves if there are older servers on the network.
* Add channel::disable\_local\_channels config option.
* Add support for IPv6 DNSBLs. A new "type" option specifies the IP version(s)
  for which each DNSBL should be checked.
* Make flood control settings configurable by those who know exactly what they
  are doing.
* Add serverinfo::nicklen config option to limit the nick length for local
  users. Different values of this option do not break the server protocol.
* Add extb\_usermode extension, $m:+- extban matching against umodes.
* Extend extb\_oper extension to allow matching against oper privileges.
* Add m\_remove extension, /remove command as in ircd-seven.
* Add general::away\_interval to allow configuring /away rate limiting.
* Add listener::defer\_accept to delay accepting a connection until the client
  sends data. This depends on kernel support. It may break BOPM checking.

### misc

* In mkpasswd, default to SHA512-based crypt instead of MD5-based crypt.
* Add --with-custom-branding and --with-custom-version configure options to
  help forks/patchsets distinguish themselves.

* Ensure SIGHUP and SIGINT keep working after a SIGINT restart.
* Add --enable-fhs-paths configure option to allow installing into a more
  FHS-like hierarchy.
* Remove broken GnuTLS support. SSL/TLS is now only provided using OpenSSL.

## charybdis-3.3.0

### server protocol

* Add new BAN command, for propagated network-wide bans (K/X:lines and RESVs).
  These will burst to new servers as they are introduced, and will stay in sync
  across the whole network (new BAN capab).
* Add new MLOCK command, to implement ircd-side channel mode locks. This allows
  services to send out a list of mode letters for a given channel which may not
  be changed, preventing mode fights between services and client bots (new MLOCK
  capab).

### user

* New RPL\_QUIETLIST(728) and RPL\_ENDOFQUIETLIST(729) numerics are used for the
  quiet (+q) list, instead of overloading the ban list numerics.
* Users may no longer change the topic of a -t channel if they cannot send to
  it.
* Add help for EXTBAN, describing the syntax of extended bans in general, as
  well as the most common types.
* Changed AWAY messages are now propagated to other servers. Previously, AWAY
  was only propagated when the user was not already away.
* Channel mode +c (and other places that disallow colour codes) now also strip
  ASCII 29 (mIRC 7 italics).
* Add auto-accept for user mode +g (callerid): Messaging a user while set +g
  will automatically add them to your accept list.
* Add target change for channels. It applies to unopped, unvoiced and unopered
  users. This has the effect of stopping spambots which join, message and part
  many channels at a time.
* Show RPL\_WHOISLOGGEDIN in /whowas as well as in /whois entries. This adds at
  most an additional 0.5MB of memory usage.

### config

* Add general::use\_propagated\_bans to switch the new BAN system on or off.
* Add general::default\_ident\_timeout, to control the timeout for identd (auth)
  connections.
* Add channel::channel\_target\_change to switch the new channel target change limits
  on or off.
* Fix class::number\_per\_ident so that it also applies to connections without
  identd.
* Change the example sslport option to 6697, which is more standard than 9999.

### misc

* The custom channel mode API has been rewritten, allowing these modules to work
  correctly when reloaded, or loaded from the config file.
* The EFNet RBL is now recommended, instead of DroneBL.
* Remove the unsupported modules directory.
* Numerous bug fixes and code cleanups.
* In mkpasswd, default to MD5 crypt instead of insecure DES.

## charybdis-3.2.0

### server protocol

* Apply +z to messages blocked by +b and +q as well. (new EOPMOD capab)
* Add new topic command ETB, allowing services to set topic+setter+ts always.
  (new EOPMOD capab)
* The slash ('/') character is now allowed in spoofs.

### user

* Add can\_kick hook, based on the ircd-seven one.
* Add cmode +C (no CTCP) from ircd-seven.
* Flood checking has been reworked.
* Fix op-moderate (cmode +z) for channel names with '@'.
* Add CERTFP support, allowing users to connect with an SSL client
  certificate and propagating the certificate fingerprint to other servers.
  Services packages can use this to identify users based on client
  certificates.
* Maintain the list of recently used targets (for the target change
  anti-spam system) in most-recently-used order, overwriting the least
  recently used target with a new one. This should be friendlier to users
  without giving spambots anything.
* Do not require target change slots for replying to the last five users to
  send a private message, notice or invite.
* Apply target change restrictions to /invite.
* Apply umode +g/+R restrictions to /invite, with the difference that
  instead of sending " is messaging you" the invite is let through
  since that is just as noisy.

### oper

* Add /rehash throttles to clear throttling.
* Send all server notices resulting from a remote /rehash to the oper.
* '\s' for space is now part of the matching, not a substitution at xline
  time, fixing various issues with it.
* Display o:line "nickname" in oper-up server notices.
* Fix sendq exceeded snotes for servers.
* SCAN UMODES: default list-max to 500, like a global WHO.
* Ignore directory names in MODRELOAD to avoid crashing if it is a core
  module and the path is incorrect.
* Tweaks to spambot checks.

### config

* Add channel::only\_ascii\_channels config option to restrict channel names
  to printable ascii only.
* Add channel::resv\_forcepart, forcibly parts local users on channel RESV,
  default enabled.

### misc

* New mkpasswd from ircd-ratbox.
* Check more system calls for errors and handle the errors.
* Various ssld/libratbox bugfixes from ircd-ratbox. [some MERGED]
* Fix fd passing on FreeBSD/amd64 and possibly Solaris/sparc. [MERGED]
* Various documentation improvements. [some MERGED]
* Fix some crash issues. [MERGED]
* Add bandb from ircd-ratbox, which stores permanent dlines/klines/xlines/resvs
  in an sqlite database instead of a flatfile and does the storage in a
  helper process. Use bin/bantool -i to import your old bans into the
  database.

## charybdis-3.1.0

* Remove TS5 support. No TS5 servers are permitted in a network with
  charybdis 3.1.0 or newer, except jupes.
* Replace oper flags by privilege sets (privsets). This adds an extra
  level of indirection between oper flags and operator blocks. /stats O
  (capital O) shows the configured privsets.
* Update libratbox and ssld from upstream and use it better.
* Add auth\_user to auth{}. This allows specifying a username:password instead
  of just a password in PASS, so that a fixed user@host is not necessary
  for a specific auth{} block.
* Add need\_ssl to auth{} and operator{}. This makes these blocks reject
  the user if not connected via SSL.
* Allow modules to provide simple channel modes without parameter.
* Remove restrictions on CNAME in the resolver.
* Make the resolver remember nonresponsive nameservers.
* Move nick collision notices from +s to +k.
* Add additional information to various server notices about server
  connections.
* Show throttle information in /stats t.
* Show rejectcache and throttle information in /testline.
* Show oper reason in /testline.
* Allow opers to see other users' umodes with /mode .
* SCAN UMODES GLOBAL NO-LIST MASK is no longer an operspy command.
* Also apply floodcount to messages to remote clients (except services).
* Remove user@server messages to local users. Sending such messages to
  remote servers is still possible, for securely messaging pseudoservers
  whether service{}'ed or not. The special oper-only syntax opers@server
  remains as well.
* Allow /list on a named +p channel. A full /list already included +p channels.
* Add operspy /topic.
* For remote rehashes, send error messages to the requesting oper as well.
* Disable autoconnect for a server with excessive TS delta.
* Disallow invites to juped channels.
* Warn about certain duplicate and redundant auth blocks.
* Make PRIVMSG/NOTICE behave as CPRIVMSG/CNOTICE automatically if possible.
* Allow +z messages from outside if a channel is -n.
* Allow coloured part reasons in -c channels.
* Add ircu-like WHOX support. This allows requesting specific information
  in /who and allows obtaining services login name for all users in a
  channel. XChat/Conspire use WHOX to update away status more efficiently.
* Allow opers and shide\_exempt users to see hopcounts even if flatten\_links
  is on.
* Rework ip\_cloaking.
* Add the IP address to userlog, as in ircd-ratbox 3.0.
* Split cidr\_bitlen into cidr\_ipv4\_bitlen and cidr\_ipv6\_bitlen.
* Allow using ziplinks with SSL connections. This is not as efficient as
  using OpenSSL's built in compression, but also works with older versions
  of OpenSSL.
* Fix an off by one error with zipstats processing, which could overwrite
  a variable with NULL causing a crash on some systems.
* Document some extensions in charybdis-oper-guide.
* Add more server protocol documentation.
* Add m\_sendbans extension, SENDBANS command to propagate xlines and resvs
  manually.
* Add chm\_sslonly extension, cmode +S for SSL/TLS only channels.
* Add chm\_operonly extension, cmode +O for IRCop only channels.
* Add chm\_adminonly extension, cmode +A for server admin only channels.
* Various code cleanups.

  +b/-b $~z (extensions/chm\_sslonly\_compat.so).
* A new compatibility channel mode, +O, has been added, it sets
  +iI/-iI $o (extensions/chm\_operonly\_compat.so).
* Add remote D:lines. Note that these are not enabled by default.

  things like the user's IP address in the reason.
* Use sendto\_one\_notice() more.
* Server notices about kills now include the victim's nick!user@host instead
  of just nick.
* Include real hostname in Closing Link message for unknown connections
  that have sent USER, in particular banned users.
* Add some documentation about the SASL client protocol.
* Change spambot, flooder and jupe joiner notices from host to orighost.
* Remove the last remains of server hostmasking (this made it possible to
  have multiple servers with similar names appear as a single server).
* Keep bitmasks of modularized umodes reserved forever to the letter,
  avoiding problems when reloading umode modules in a different order.
* Fix -logfile.
* Update to the new revision (v8) of the TS6 spec, this fixes problems with
  joins reversing certain mode changes crossing them. This interoperates
  with older versions.
* Put "End of Channel Quiet List" at the end of +q lists.
* Fix invisible count getting desynched from reality if the act of opering
  up sets -i or +i.
* Don't leak auth{} spoofed IP addresses in +f notices.
* Shorten quit/part/kick reasons to avoid quit reasons overflowing the
  client exiting server notice (from TOPICLEN to 260).
* Fix some cases where 10 char usernames lose their final character.
* Move username check after xline and dnsbl checks, so it will not complain
  to opers about clients who are xlined or blacklisted anyway (both of
  which silently reject).
* Remove invite\_ops\_only config option, forcing it to YES.
* Allow /invite (but not invex) to override +r, +l, +j in addition to +i.

  single ban exception existed on a channel.
* Tweak \s code a little.
* Add a minor clarification to the SGML docs.
* Avoid truncation in ip\_cloaking (by removing components on the other side).
  Note that this may cause channel +bqeI modes set on such very long hosts
  to no longer match.

## charybdis-2.1.1

* Search the shortest list (user's/channel's) when looking up channel
  memberships.
* Make the SID-collision notice look right under all conditions.
* Move kills from services from +s to +k snomask.
* When no\_tilde is present on an auth{} block, check the non-tilde version
  of the user@host against k:lines as well.

* Move a large part of the ircd into libcharybdis.
* Don't complain "unknown user mode" if a user tries to unset
  a mode they do not have access to.
* Update our challenge specification to the challenge implementation in
  ratbox 2.2 for interoperability.

  and the clients affected by them.
* Add CHANTRACE and TRACEMASK commands from ratbox 3.0
* Use IsOperAdmin() instead of IsAdmin() when sending admin-only messages,
  that way hidden admins get them too.

  received.
* Add some logging in places where we drop servers and only notify
  server operators.

* Do not show the channels a service is sitting in.
* Reverted the aline code from hybrid-7.2
* Make sure TS6 services are recognized properly if connected remotely.
* Tweak something in services support for cyrix boxes.

## charybdis-1.0.2

* Don't display a blank RPL\_WHOISCHANNELS in a remote whois request.
* Allow modules to provide new usermodes.
* On a nickname collision, change the collided nick to their unique ID,
  if general::collision\_fnc is enabled in the config.
* Don't allow UID lookups in /monitor + and /monitor s
* Fix a garbage issue with channel mode +j.
* Apply proper capability flags to the proper server in me\_gcap().

* Clear +q lists on a lowerTS SJOIN.
* Ported a generic k/d/x-line parser from hybrid-7.2 which resulted in
  duplicate code reduction.
* Fix linebuf raw code to not truncate lines longer than 512 bytes;
  improves ziplink reliability on net junction.
* Use find\_named\_person() vs find\_person() in services alias code.

* Change ERR\_NOSUCHNICK to ERR\_SERVICESOFFLINE in services aliases.
* Add remote rehashing.
* Document service { } blocks (u:lines on ircu).
* Document identify\_service and identify\_command in reference.conf.

## charybdis-1.0

* Implement channel mode +L for channel list limit exemptions.
* Implement channel mode +P primarily as a status mode, permanant
  channel -- this is usually enforced via services registrations.
* Change behaviour of /stats p: now displays all staff members instead
  of local ones only.
* Make oper\_list global, add local\_oper\_list for local traffic.
* Strip control codes from parts and quits.
* Add channel mode +c which strips control codes from messages sent to
  the channel.
* Add channel mode +g which enables free use of the /invite command.
* Add channel mode +z which sends rejected messages to channel ops.
  Could be useful for Q&A sessions or other similar events.
* Add channel quietmasks. These are recommended over the use of channel
  bans used to remove a user's ability to participate in the channel.
* Add channel join throttling mode, +j. Used to throttle channel join
  traffic, i.e. join/part flood attacks. Syntax: +j :
* Improvements to channel\_modes(), from shadowircd -- allows for
  better construction of the mode string.
* Use the undernet throttle notice instead of bancache message when
  dealing with rejected clients. (stolen from ircu2.10.12)
* Add channel forwarding, via channel mode +f, behaves similarly to
  dancer-ircd version.

* Add simple hack that enables use of server password for automatic
  identify.

This is a FIX FOR A SECURITY VULNERABILITY. All Charybdis users must
apply this fix if you support SASL on your servers, or unload m_sasl.so
in the meantime.
