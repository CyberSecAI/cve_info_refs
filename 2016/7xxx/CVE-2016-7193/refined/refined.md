  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-7193",
    "description": "An Office RTF remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle RTF files. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of RTF files by Microsoft Office software.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of RTF files"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system, potentially leading to data loss, malware installation, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email attack: Attacker sends a specially crafted RTF file to the user, convincing them to open it.",
      "Web-based attack: Attacker hosts a website or compromises a website to host a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious RTF file. For successful exploitation, the attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted RTF file. This may be done via social engineering in email or on a compromised website.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability has been detected in limited attacks in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to gain code execution. The update addresses this by changing the way Microsoft Office software handles RTF content."
