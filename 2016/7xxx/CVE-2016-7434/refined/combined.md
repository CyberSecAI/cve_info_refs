#### Description

If `ntpd` is configured to allow `mrulist` query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, `ntpd` will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious `mrulist` query packet.

---

#### Mitigation

* Only allow `mrulist` query packets from trusted hosts.
* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p9 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

## NTP.org ntpd contains multiple denial of service vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#633847

Original Release Date: 2016-11-21 | Last Revised: 2017-11-20

### Overview

NTP.org ntpd versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94 contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.

### Description

| NTP.org's ntpd, versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94, contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-476**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**: NULL Pointer Dereference -** CVE-2016-9311According to NTP.org, "ntpd does not enable trap service by default. If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service. Affects Windows only."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-9310According to NTP.org, "An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified, a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps, disabling legitimate monitoring. A remote, unauthenticated, network attacker can trigger this vulnerability."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7427According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode replay prevention functionality can be abused. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7428According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality can be abused. To limit abuse, ntpd restricts the rate at which each broadcast association will process incoming packets. ntpd will reject broadcast mode packets that arrive before the poll interval specified in the preceding broadcast packet expires. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-9312According to NTP.org, "If a vulnerable instance of ntpd on Windows receives a crafted malicious packet that is "too big", ntpd will stop working."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7431According to NTP.org, "Zero Origin timestamp problems were fixed by Bug 2945 in ntp-4.2.8p6. However, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp checks."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7434According to NTP.org, "If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet."[**CWE-605**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/605.html)**: Multiple Binds to the Same Port -** CVE-2016-7429According to NTP.org, "When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a different interface than was used for the request, the peer structure is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on a host with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating system doesn't check source address in received packets (e.g. rp\_filter on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source can send a packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to select wrong interface for the source and prevent it from sending new requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed, which happens on routing changes or every 5 minutes by default. If the attack is repeated often enough (once per second), ntpd will not be able to synchronize with the source."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-7426According to NTP.org, "When ntpd is configured with rate limiting for all associations (restrict default limited in ntp.conf), the limits are applied also to responses received from its configured sources. An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources."[**CWE-682**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)**: Incorrect Calculation -** CVE-2016-7433According to NTP.org, "Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulae have been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly."For more information, please see NTP.org's [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#November_2016_ntp_4_2_8p9_NTP_Se).The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-9312. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to perform a denial of service on ntpd. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Implement BCP-38.**Use "restrict default noquery ..." in your ntp.conf file. Only allow mode 6 queries from trusted networks and hosts.**Apply an update**Upgrade to [4.2.8p9](nwtime.org/ntp428p9_release), or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.**Monitor ntpd**Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running. |

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

How about 'Remote pre-authentication single packet denial of service vulnerability caused by inadequate incoming packet checks in read_mru_list()' ?  I'd like to highlight that today it is 80 days since I first reported this vulnerability, not to mention that it has existed for 104 days now since the last release. The longer this vulnerability remains unresolved, the higher the chance of people with bad intentions finding it.  Since I used publicly known tried and tested techniques for discovering it, the discovery of it by others is plausible. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=3082#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2016-10-01 08:42:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=3082#c10))  > I'd like to highlight that today it is 80 days since I first reported this > vulnerability, not to mention that it has existed for 104 days now since the > last release.

Yeah, we think these delays suck too.  Reality bites - we remain severely under-resourced for the work that needs to be done.  You can yell at us about it, and/or you can work to help us, and/or you can work to get others to help us. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=3082#c12)  Harlan Stenn    2016-10-01 09:13:49 UTC  ``` STAGED for 4.2.8p9 ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=3082#c13)  Harlan Stenn    2016-11-21 15:04:54 UTC  ``` Magnus,  Thanks for the report.  Please check ntp-4.2.8p9 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or IN_PROGRESS, as appropriate.  Pearly, thanks for your work on this. ``` |  |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

FreeBSD-SA-16:39.ntp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities of ntp
Category: contrib
Module: ntp
Announced: 2016-12-22
Credits: Network Time Foundation
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2016-11-22 16:22:51 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
2016-12-22 16:19:05 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p6)

2016-12-22 16:19:05 UTC (releng/9.3, 9.3-RELEASE-p53)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-7426, CVE-2016-7427, CVE-2016-7428, CVE-2016-7431,
CVE-2016-7433, CVE-2016-7434, CVE-2016-9310, CVE-2016-9311
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
Trap is a mechanism to collect NTP daemon information from remote.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NTP suite:
CVE-2016-9311: Trap crash, Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-9310: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS
vector. Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7427: Broadcast Mode Replay Prevention DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7428: Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7431: Regression: 010-origin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass.
Reported by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.
CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference in \_IO\_str\_init\_static\_internal().
Reported by Magnus Stubman.
CVE-2016-7426: Client rate limiting and server responses. Reported by
Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.
CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem. Reported independently
by Brian Utterback of Oracle, and by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra
of Boston University.
III. Impact
A remote attacker who can send a specially crafted packet to cause a
NULL pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a Denial of
Service. [CVE-2016-9311]
An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the
control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing
BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified,
a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing
information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,
disabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote. [CVE-2016-9310]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically
inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast
domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject
broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.
[CVE-2016-7427]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially
crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while
being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets
from legitimate NTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7428]
Origin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6. However, subsequent
timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of
some Zero origin timestamp checks. [CVE-2016-7431]
If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server
that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of
that crafted malicious mrulist query packet. [CVE-2016-7434]
An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server
response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can
periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate
limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses
from its sources. [CVE-2016-7426]
Ntp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included
twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to
a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix
for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did
not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulas have
been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.
[CVE-2016-7433]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with these attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.0.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-10.x.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-10.x.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.x.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-9.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-9.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-9.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).
