Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the Catapult DCT2000 dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The dissector does not properly validate the size of the data it's processing, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack when parsing a malformed packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A malformed packet can cause Wireshark to crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although the provided information only confirms a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network injection: An attacker can inject a specially crafted, malformed packet onto the network.
- Malicious capture file: An attacker can provide a malformed packet trace file to a user, who would trigger the vulnerability when opening it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to inject packets: An attacker must have the capability to inject network packets or deliver a malicious capture file.
- No specific privilege required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.5.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark version 2.0.6.
- The provided information includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) file.
