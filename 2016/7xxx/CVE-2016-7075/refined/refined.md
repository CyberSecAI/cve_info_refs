Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Kubernetes API server validates X.509 client certificates. Specifically, it does not correctly validate the host name fields within the intermediate certificates provided by the client during the authentication process. Instead of using the subject CN of the end-entity certificate, the API server uses the subject CN of the intermediate certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Certificate Validation:** The API server fails to properly validate the provided certificate chain, particularly concerning intermediate certificates.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the incorrect validation, an attacker can craft a malicious X.509 certificate to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Authentication Requirements:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system by using a specially crafted X.509 certificate that exploits this flaw.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:**  While not explicitly stated, bypassing authentication can be a stepping stone for further malicious actions, including privilege escalation within the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious X.509 Certificate:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious X.509 certificate where the intermediate certificate's CN is different from the intended entity certificate's CN.
- **Client-Side Attack:** The attack occurs during the client authentication process where the server incorrectly validates the presented client certificates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create X.509 Certificates:** The attacker needs the capability to generate or acquire X.509 certificates.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.
- **No Need for User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, as well as upstream Kubernetes.
- The issue was addressed via RHSA-2016:2064, which included updated RPM packages, and RHBA-2016:2065, which contained updated container images for these platforms.
- The fix ensures proper validation of X.509 certificates, specifically checking the subject CN of the end-entity certificate and not the intermediate certificate.
- This issue was initially reported upstream at: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/34517>
