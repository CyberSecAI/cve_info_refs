Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an uninitialized memory read in the Skia library. Specifically, the `SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY` function could return without initializing the output parameter 't' under certain failure conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Memory Read:** The primary vulnerability is that a variable (`t` in the `ChopMonoAtY` function) could be used without being assigned a value.
- **Lack of Return Value Check:** The calling code did not check the return value of  `SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY` which indicates if the output parameter 't' has been initialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially cause a read from uninitialized memory. This could lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially causing a crash, information disclosure, or other undefined behavior. The specific impact would depend on how the uninitialized value is subsequently used.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability could be triggered by crafting specific cubic paths that cause `SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY` to return without properly initializing the output parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to control the input to the `SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY` function, specifically the cubic path data, to trigger the failure condition. This likely means the attacker would need to control the rendering of a webpage or other content that uses the Skia library to draw cubic paths.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided code review ([2006143009](https://codereview.chromium.org/2006143009/)) shows the fix was to update the calling code to check the return value from `SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY` and handle the case where it returns false, preventing use of the uninitialized 't' variable. The code review also considered and rejected initializing 't' to avoid masking a potentially larger issue.

- The Debian Security Advisory ([DSA 3667-1](https://www.debian.org/security/2016/dsa-3667)) lists CVE-2016-7395 as being fixed in chromium-browser version 53.0.2785.113-1~deb8u1.
