We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[642598](https://crbug.com/642598)] CVE-2016-5167: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity) or [LibFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer).

Interested in switching release channels? [Find out how](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). Â If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://crbug.com/). Â The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

The calling code is here I think:  static void tangent_cubic(const SkPoint pts[], SkScalar x, SkScalar y,         SkTDArray<SkVector>* tangents) {     if (!between(pts[0].fY, y, pts[1].fY) && !between(pts[1].fY, y, pts[2].fY)              && !between(pts[2].fY, y, pts[3].fY)) {         return;     }     if (!between(pts[0].fX, x, pts[1].fX) && !between(pts[1].fX, x, pts[2].fX)              && !between(pts[2].fX, x, pts[3].fX)) {         return;     }     SkPoint dst[10];     int n = SkChopCubicAtYExtrema(pts, dst);     for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {         SkPoint* c = &dst[i * 3];         SkScalar t;         SkAssertResult(SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY(c, y, &t));         SkScalar xt = eval_cubic_pts(c[0].fX, c[1].fX, c[2].fX, c[3].fX, t);         if (!SkScalarNearlyEqual(x, xt)) {             continue;         }         SkVector tangent;         SkEvalCubicAt(c, t, nullptr, &tangent, nullptr);         tangents->push(tangent);     } }  I think what is happening is that ChopMonoAtY() is returning false (hence t is uninitialized) but the code does not check for that (only in Debug does it assert). It seems like the proper fix is to check the return result and handle false here.  +cary who worked on this area I think.  I think we should also add more SK_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT annotations to routines like these. I will work on that now. ```     | **Martin Barbella** | | On 2016/05/26 18:00:22, reed1 wrote: > Initializing t to something when we're going to return ... | | --- | | 4 years, 7 months ago (2016-05-26 18:02:43 UTC) [#9](#msg9) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/05/26 18:00:22, reed1 wrote: > Initializing t to something when we're going to return false just hides a larger > bug, so I'd prefer we fix the larger bug (since no value of t will give a > meaningful answer to the caller). >  > The calling code is here I think: >  > static void tangent_cubic(const SkPoint pts[], SkScalar x, SkScalar y, >         SkTDArray<SkVector>* tangents) { >     if (!between(pts[0].fY, y, pts[1].fY) && !between(pts[1].fY, y, pts[2].fY) >              && !between(pts[2].fY, y, pts[3].fY)) { >         return; >     } >     if (!between(pts[0].fX, x, pts[1].fX) && !between(pts[1].fX, x, pts[2].fX) >              && !between(pts[2].fX, x, pts[3].fX)) { >         return; >     } >     SkPoint dst[10]; >     int n = SkChopCubicAtYExtrema(pts, dst); >     for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) { >         SkPoint* c = &dst[i * 3]; >         SkScalar t; >         SkAssertResult(SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY(c, y, &t)); >         SkScalar xt = eval_cubic_pts(c[0].fX, c[1].fX, c[2].fX, c[3].fX, t); >         if (!SkScalarNearlyEqual(x, xt)) { >             continue; >         } >         SkVector tangent; >         SkEvalCubicAt(c, t, nullptr, &tangent, nullptr); >         tangents->push(tangent); >     } > } >  > I think what is happening is that ChopMonoAtY() is returning false (hence t is > uninitialized) but the code does not check for that (only in Debug does it > assert).

I will work on that now.  Having SK_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT on these sounds even better, thanks for taking a look. ```     | **Martin Barbella** | | On 2016/05/26 18:02:43, Martin Barbella wrote: > On 2016/05/26 18:00:22, reed1 wrote: > > Initializing ... | | --- | | 4 years, 7 months ago (2016-05-26 18:10:00 UTC) [#10](#msg10) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |   ``` On 2016/05/26 18:02:43, Martin Barbella wrote: > On 2016/05/26 18:00:22, reed1 wrote: > > Initializing t to something when we're going to return false just hides a > larger > > bug, so I'd prefer we fix the larger bug (since no value of t will give a > > meaningful answer to the caller). > >  > > The calling code is here I think: > >  > > static void tangent_cubic(const SkPoint pts[], SkScalar x, SkScalar y, > >         SkTDArray<SkVector>* tangents) { > >     if (!between(pts[0].fY, y, pts[1].fY) && !between(pts[1].fY, y, pts[2].fY) > >              && !between(pts[2].fY, y, pts[3].fY)) { > >         return; > >     } > >     if (!between(pts[0].fX, x, pts[1].fX) && !between(pts[1].fX, x, pts[2].fX) > >              && !between(pts[2].fX, x, pts[3].fX)) { > >         return; > >     } > >     SkPoint dst[10]; > >     int n = SkChopCubicAtYExtrema(pts, dst); > >     for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) { > >         SkPoint* c = &dst[i * 3]; > >         SkScalar t; > >         SkAssertResult(SkCubicClipper::ChopMonoAtY(c, y, &t)); > >         SkScalar xt = eval_cubic_pts(c[0].fX, c[1].fX, c[2].fX, c[3].fX, t); > >         if (!SkScalarNearlyEqual(x, xt)) { > >             continue; > >         } > >         SkVector tangent; > >         SkEvalCubicAt(c, t, nullptr, &tangent, nullptr); > >         tangents->push(tangent); > >     } > > } > >  > > I think what is happening is that ChopMonoAtY() is returning false (hence t is > > uninitialized) but the code does not check for that (only in Debug does it > > assert).
