Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7063:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Pritunl Client's local service, running as root, accepted user-provided profile data. When starting a profile, the service wrote the user-provided configuration data to a file path specified within the profile data. This path was not properly sanitized, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the file path provided by the user, which is used by the root service when writing the configuration. This enables an attacker to write files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The service that writes the file operates with root privileges, meaning that files can be created or overwritten by an attacker in locations that are normally restricted to privileged users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker could write arbitrary data to any location on the file system, effectively bypassing standard access controls.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By writing to sensitive system files, an attacker could modify the system, install backdoors, or execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The provided proof of concept showed writing to a cron tab to execute commands as root.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Networked API Endpoint:** The vulnerable service exposed an API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:9770/profile` that was used to send profile configuration data.
*   **Local Service Communication:** The client application communicated with the local root service to start profiles, providing an attack vector to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the local service listening on `127.0.0.1:9770`.
*   **Pritunl Client:** The attacker needs a running instance of the vulnerable Pritunl Client software to use the API.

The provided exploit code demonstrates the following:

1.  **Creates a C source code file:** This file contains a simple program to execute a shell with root privileges when compiled and the setuid bit is set.
2.  **Crafts a payload:** A profile JSON object is constructed with an "id" field that contains a path traversal sequence (`../../var/at/tabs/root`) and data that contains a cron command to create a setuid shell binary from the C source code file.
3.  **Sends a request:** The exploit uses the `requests` library to make a `POST` request to the vulnerable `/profile` endpoint, sending the crafted payload.
4.  **Executes the Exploit:** The exploit waits for cron to execute the commands, then attempts to execute the created binary.

This attack would allow an attacker to gain root access to the local machine.
