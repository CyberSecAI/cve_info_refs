Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions within the "Pocket Router Function" of the WFS-SR01 device. This allows unauthorized access to certain resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Restriction Bypass:** The device fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain access to the SD card or other memory devices inserted into the WFS-SR01. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data stored on these devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network (likely via Wi-Fi as it's a wireless router), without needing to be physically present or having any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable WFS-SR01 device. No prior authentication is needed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-7807 describes an access restriction bypass vulnerability in the WFS-SR01 portable storage device. An unauthenticated attacker can remotely exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to data stored on inserted memory devices like SD cards.
