  "CVE-2016-7865": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of LocalConnection objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error when handling LocalConnection objects, stemming from a lack of validation of object existence before operations are performed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious website",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted SWF file and convince the user to open it, or host the file on a compromised website.",
        "additional_information": "This CVE is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities addressed in Adobe Security Bulletin APSB16-37. The vulnerability specifically affects the handling of LocalConnection objects. A missing validation check leads to a use-after-free condition, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious website containing a malicious SWF file or opening a malicious file. The vulnerability is rated as 'Critical' due to the potential for remote code execution."
