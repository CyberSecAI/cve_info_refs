Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue in how the WNC01WH network camera processes POST requests. This likely involves insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the POST request, allowing the attacker to manipulate file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. This means that an attacker can manipulate file paths provided in a POST request to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network.
- **POST Request Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts a malicious POST request with a manipulated file path to delete files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's management interface to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device to send the malicious POST request.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
CVE-2016-7826 describes a directory traversal vulnerability in the WNC01WH network camera, specifically triggered by a maliciously crafted POST request. An authenticated attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the device.
