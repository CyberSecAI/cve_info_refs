  "CVE-2016-7133": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the php_check_specific_open_basedir function within the PHP source code, specifically in the fopen_wrappers.c file. This vulnerability occurs due to an integer overflow when calculating the path length, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the path into a temporary buffer using memcpy.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of path length, which allows a crafted path to bypass size checks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution if the overflow is manipulated correctly, by providing a large crafted path to functions that utilize open_basedir.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Providing a large crafted path to functions using open_basedir."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the path that is being checked with `open_basedir` to trigger the overflow.",
