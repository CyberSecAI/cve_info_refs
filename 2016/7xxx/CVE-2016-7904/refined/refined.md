Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7904:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how CMS Made Simple handled CSRF tokens. The token was being exposed through the HTTP Referer header when a user added an article with an image that had a link to an attacker-controlled domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Token Leakage:** The primary weakness is the leakage of the CSRF token via the HTTP Referer header. When a user adds an article with a link that points to an attacker's server, the Referer header, which includes the CSRF token (`_sk_`), is sent to that server.
*   **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The CSRF protection mechanism was not robust enough to prevent this type of attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Administrative Session Hijacking:** An attacker could gain control of an administrative user's session by obtaining the CSRF token.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** With the stolen CSRF token, the attacker could perform actions as the administrator, such as adding a new admin user. In the provided PoC, this includes adding a new user called `test` with a password `123456`, and adding this user to all groups.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link in Content:** The attacker crafts a malicious link (in an image tag for example) within a CMS article, pointing to a web page under their control. The referer header leaks the CSRF token to the attacker's server.
*   **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** An administrator user must visit or interact with the crafted link for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create content within CMS:** The attacker must be able to create content within the CMS that allows the inclusion of a link to an external URL.
*   **External Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious page that receives the Referer header containing the CSRF token.
*   **Ability to construct a form and submit using javascript:** The attacker must construct the malicious HTML to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the leaked CSRF token to create a new administrator user, further illustrating the severity of the vulnerability. The fix implemented in 2.1.6, as described in the changelog, makes the token handling more secure.
