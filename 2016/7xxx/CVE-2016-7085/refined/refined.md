Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a DLL hijacking issue within the VMware Workstation installer. The installer improperly loads certain DLL files, which can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The installer loads DLLs insecurely, which allows an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL into the loading path. The application will then load the attacker-controlled DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the vulnerable Workstation installer is run. This code will run with the privileges of the user executing the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to place a specially crafted malicious DLL file in the path that the installer searches when loading DLLs. The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Installer Execution:** The user must execute the vulnerable Workstation installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable installer is to be executed.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to directories that are searched when the installer loads DLLs.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):**  The attacker would likely need to convince the victim to run the modified installer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects VMware Workstation Pro and Player on Windows systems.
- The provided advisory mentions that a patch is available in version 12.5.0.
- The vulnerability does not affect Linux versions of the software.
- There is no workaround for this issue other than patching.
