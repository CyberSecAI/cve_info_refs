Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7124:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content includes a description of CVE-2016-7124 from Tenable, which matches the official CVE description, which states:

> ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 mishandles certain invalid objects, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data that leads to a (1) \_\_destruct call or (2) magic method call.

Additionally, the provided Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201611-22) also references CVE-2016-7124 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting PHP versions < 5.6.28, confirming the relevance of the content.

**2. Extracted Information:**

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability lies in how PHP's `ext/standard/var_unserializer.c` handles specific types of invalid objects during deserialization.
    - Specifically, when an unexpected object is encountered during unserialization, the `__wakeup()` magic method is not invoked.
    - Instead, either the `__destruct()` method is called if the object is destroyed or other magic methods might be called if the object is not destroyed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - Improper handling of invalid objects during unserialization.
    - Lack of proper validation or sanitization of serialized data before using it.
    - Inconsistent invocation of `__wakeup()` during deserialization.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Remote attackers can potentially cause:
        - A denial of service (DoS).
        - Unspecified other impacts through magic method calls (e.g., execution of arbitrary code).
        - Triggering `__destruct()` calls with crafted properties, which can lead to further exploitation.
        - Injection of arbitrary session data by controlling the session name and sending it to a vulnerable server, potentially allowing attackers to hijack sessions.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    - A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted serialized data to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `unserialize()` function.
    - The attack vector also extends to session handling, where manipulating the session name can lead to injection of arbitrary session data through the php or php\_binary session handler.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to send crafted serialized data to a vulnerable PHP application. This could be achieved through various means depending on the application's design.
    - In the context of session injection, the attacker needs to control the session name (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack or a separate vulnerability) and send it to the vulnerable server.

* **Additional Details:**
    - The vulnerability was addressed in PHP versions 5.6.25 and 7.0.10.
    - The vulnerability is due to a flaw in `ext/standard/var_unserializer.c`, specifically in `object_common1()` and `process_nested_data()`.
    - The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
    - Both Tenable and Red Hat classify the severity of this CVE as Critical or High.
    - The vulnerability is related to a session data injection vulnerability described in the upstream bug report: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=72681>

**Summary:**

CVE-2016-7124 is a critical vulnerability in PHP that arises from improper deserialization handling of certain invalid objects. An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted serialized data, potentially resulting in DoS, RCE or session injection. Patches are available for PHP versions 5.6.25 and 7.0.10 to address this vulnerability.
