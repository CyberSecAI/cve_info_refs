{
  "CVE-2016-7949": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is present in libXrender, where insufficient validation of server responses can lead to an overflow of previously reserved memory.",
    "root_cause": "The client library does not properly validate the lengths of data received from the server, leading to a potential overflow during memory allocation and writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause out-of-bounds memory writes, leading to potential code execution or denial of service. A malicious or compromised X server could exploit this by providing crafted responses.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious or compromised X server sends crafted replies to a client application using libXrender.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the X server or a virtual X server that the client connects to. This often requires local access but can be achieved remotely if the X server is accessible."
