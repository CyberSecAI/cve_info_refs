{
  "CVE-2016-7030": {
    "Root cause": "FreeIPA enforces password policies for all principals, including services which use keytabs with randomly-generated/strong keys.",
    "Weaknesses": "Default password policy locks an account after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts for 10 minutes.",
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can lock-out any principal, including system services, causing a denial of service.",
     "Attack vectors": "Remote unauthenticated user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No specific capabilities or position are required other than the ability to attempt authentication against the service."
  },
 "CVE-2016-9575": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient permission check in `certprofile-mod` command",
    "Weaknesses": "Missing permission check allows modification of certificate profiles by unprivileged users.",
    "Impact": "An authenticated, unprivileged attacker can modify profiles to issue certificates with arbitrary naming or key usage information, potentially leading to impersonation or unauthorized use.",
    "Attack vectors": "Authenticated but unprivileged user modifying certificate profile configurations.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires a valid user account, but not elevated privileges."
  }
