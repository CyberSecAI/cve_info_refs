{
  "CVE-2016-7426": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd applies rate limits to responses from configured sources when rate limiting is enabled for all associations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper rate limiting"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by preventing ntpd from accepting valid responses from configured time sources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sending spoofed packets to keep rate limiting activated.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must know the NTP sources used by the target, which can be obtained from the IPv4 refid in a server response. The target must also be misconfigured to use rate limiting for all associations."
  },
    "CVE-2016-7429": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd updates the peer structure to use the interface that received the response. If source address verification is disabled and the system has multiple interfaces, the attacker can cause the ntpd to use the wrong interface.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of server responses on multihomed systems",
        "Lack of source address verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "NTP service does not synchronize with the intended time source.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sends spoofed packets from a known source to a different interface on the target system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must know the source address of a valid NTP server. The target OS must also not verify the source address of packets and have multiple interfaces."
  },
  "CVE-2016-9311": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd suffers from a null pointer dereference when the trap service is enabled, triggered by a specially crafted packet.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
       "Improper handling of crafted packets",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to ntpd crashing.",
     "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sends a specially crafted packet to the ntpd.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to send packets to the target ntpd service and the target must have the trap service explicitly enabled. According to the CVE description, this flaw affects Windows only, but the FreeBSD advisory indicates it affects all supported FreeBSD versions."
  },
    "CVE-2016-9310": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd control mode (mode 6) allows for configuration modification via crafted packets if 'restrict default noquery...' is not specified.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of authentication for trap configuration modification"
    ],
      "Impact": "Information disclosure, DDoS amplification, disabling legitimate monitoring, and setting/unsetting ntpd traps.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sends a crafted control mode packet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker can be unauthenticated. The ntpd server must not have the 'restrict default noquery...' configuration set."
  },
      "CVE-2016-7433": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd incorrectly calculates the root delay, due to a misinterpretation of the small-print variable in The Book. This resulted in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause denial of service or in some special cases even crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sends crafted spoofed packets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send spoofed packets to the ntpd server."
