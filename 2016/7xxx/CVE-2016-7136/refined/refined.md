Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `z3c.form` component in Plone accepting data from GET requests when it should only process POST requests. This allows an attacker to inject potentially malicious code into a form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary weakness is the ability to inject client-side scripts into the web application. The vulnerability is triggered by submitting GET requests containing malicious payloads, which are then reflected back to the user, resulting in XSS.
-   **Improper Input Handling:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize input received via GET parameters, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    -   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies or session tokens, enabling unauthorized access to user accounts.
    -   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed in the user's browser.
    -   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    -   **Malware Distribution:**  Redirecting users to pages hosting malware.
-   **Potential for Persistent XSS:** While primarily reflected XSS, the vulnerability also creates an avenue to trick users into saving persistent XSS payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious URL Construction:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within specific GET parameters. This crafted URL can then be distributed to victims via email, social media, or other means.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering tactics to trick users into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No Privilege Required:** Exploitation does not require specific user privileges, beyond the ability to send web requests to the affected server.
-   **External Attacker:**  The attacker can be external to the organization using the vulnerable Plone instance.

**Specific Vulnerable Parameters:**

The identified vulnerable parameters include:

-   `/Plone/login_form` [next parameter]
-   `/Plone/@@confirm-action` [original\_url parameter]
-   Various parameters in `/Plone/@@filter-controlpanel` (e.g., form.widgets.class\_blacklist, form.widgets.custom\_tags)
-   Various parameters in `/Plone/@@tinymce-controlpanel` (e.g., form.widgets.alignment\_styles, form.widgets.block\_styles)
-   `/Plone/@@user-information` [userid parameter]
-    `/Plone/@@navigation-controlpanel` [form.widgets.parent_types_not_to_query parameter]

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory timeline indicates that the vendor was notified on 18/07/2016 and a patch was published on 30/08/2016.
- Proof-of-concept examples are provided, showing how to inject Javascript into vulnerable parameters.
