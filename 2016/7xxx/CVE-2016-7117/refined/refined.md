  "CVE-2016-7117": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "kernel-3.10.0-327.46.1.el7",

    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem during error handling in the __sys_recvmmsg() function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could corrupt memory and possibly execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered through a recvmmsg system call, suggesting network-based remote exploitation is possible.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to send a network request that triggers an error condition in recvmmsg's error handling routines."
