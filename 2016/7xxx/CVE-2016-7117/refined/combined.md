[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0217)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)
* It is possible for a single process to cause an OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A typical process filling 4096 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of memory and there can be multiple such processes, up to a per-user-limit. (CVE-2016-2847, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Tetsuo Handa for reporting CVE-2016-2847.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, an XFS corruption in some cases occurred on Seagate 8TB drive based volumes after a planned system shutdown or reboot, when a disk write back cache was used. With this update, the megaraid\_sas driver has been fixed and the XFS corruption no longer occurs in the described scenario. (BZ#1398178)
* This update applies a set of patches for the resizable hash table (rhashtable). This set contains backported bug fixes and enhancements from upstream. (BZ#1382630)
* Previously, a kernel panic in some cases occurred during the boot with the Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) kernel module, because the NVMe driver did not receive legacy PCI interrupts. This update fixes the NVMe driver to always use the Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI/MSI-X) interrupts. As a result, the operating system now boots without panic under the described circumstances. (BZ#1396558)
* Previously, the Advanced Error Reporting (AER) correct error in some cases caused a kernel panic. This update fixes the \_scsih\_pci\_mmio\_enabled() function in the mpt3sas driver to not incorrectly return PCI\_ERS\_RESULT\_NEED\_RESET return value in the situation when PCI\_ERS\_RESULT\_RECOVERED return value is expected. As a result, the kernel no longer panics due to \_scsih\_pci\_mmio\_enabled(). (BZ#1395220)
* When resizing the Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) rings in the sfc driver with the "ethtool -G" command, a kernel protection fault in the napi\_hash\_add() function occurred on systems with a large number of queues. With this update, the efx\_copy\_channel()function in the sfc driver has been fixed to correctly clear the napi\_hash state. As a result, the sfc kernel module now unloads successfully without the mentioned kernel protection fault. (BZ#1401460)
* When a virtual machine (VM) with 2 PCI-Passthrough Ethernet interfaces attached was created, deleted and recreated, the operating system terminated unexpectedly and rebooted during the recreation. This update fixes the race condition between the eventfd and virqfd signaling mechanisms in the vfio driver. As a result, the operating system now boots without crashing in the described situation. (BZ#1391610)
* Previously, when two NFS shares with different security settings were mounted, the I/O operations to the kerberos-authenticated mount caused the RPC\_CRED\_KEY\_EXPIRE\_SOON parameter to be set, but the parameter was not unset when performing the I/O operations on the sec=sys mount. Consequently, writes to both NFS shares had the same parameters, regardless of their security settings. This update fixes this problem by moving the NO\_CRKEY\_TIMEOUT parameter to the auth->au\_flags field. As a result, NFS shares with different security settings are now handled as expected. (BZ#1388603)
* Previously, memory corruption by copying data into the wrong memory locations sometimes occurred, because the \_\_copy\_tofrom\_user() function was returning incorrect values. This update fixes the \_\_copy\_tofrom\_user() function so that it no longer returns larger values than the number of bytes it was asked to copy. As a result, memory corruption no longer occurs in he described scenario. (BZ#1398588)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

net: Fix use after free in the recvmmsg exit path

The syzkaller fuzzer hit the following use-after-free:

  Call Trace:
   [<ffffffff8175ea0e>] __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x3e/0x40 mm/kasan/report.c:295
   [<ffffffff851cc31a>] __sys_recvmmsg+0x6fa/0x7f0 net/socket.c:2261
   [<     inline     >] SYSC_recvmmsg net/socket.c:2281

   [<ffffffff86332bb6>] entry_SYSCALL_64_fastpath+0x16/0x7a
  arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:185

And, as Dmitry rightly assessed, that is because we can drop the
reference and then touch it when the underlying recvmsg calls return
some packets and then hit an error, which will make recvmmsg to set
sock->sk->sk_err, oops, fix it.

Red Hat Product Security has been made aware of a vulnerability in the Linux kernel that has been assigned  [CVE-2016-5195.](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-5195)  This issue was publicly disclosed on **October 19, 2016** and has been rated as  [Important.](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/#Important)  This issue is being refered to as "Dirty COW" in the media.

## Background Information

A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system.

This could be abused by an attacker to modify existing setuid files with instructions to elevate privileges. An exploit using this technique has been found in the wild. This flaw affects most modern Linux distributions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of  [Important.](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/)

## Impacted Products

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
* Red Hat Openshift Online v2
* Red Hat Virtualization (RHEV-H/RHV-H)

## Attack Description and Impact

This flaw allows an attacker with a local system account to modify on-disk binaries, bypassing the standard permission mechanisms that would prevent modification without an appropriate permission set. This is achieved by racing the madvise(MADV\_DONTNEED) system call while having the page of the executable mmapped in memory.

## Diagnose your vulnerability

### Determine if your system is vulnerable

[Download Detection Script](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/rh-cve-2016-5195_5.sh)

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers running the affected versions of the kernel are strongly recommended to update the kernel as soon as patches are available. Details about impacted packages as well as recommended mitigation are noted below. A system reboot is required in order for the kernel update to be applied.

## Updates for Affected Products

The fixes for CVE-2016-5195 were included in the recent release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3.

A **kpatch** for customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 or greater will be available. Please open a support case to gain access to the kpatch.

### **Mitigation**

Red Hat Support supplies mitigations like SystemTap scripts as a stop-gap until official patches are released.  SystemTap scripts are only supported for 30 days after the GA release of the final patches.

**HOW TO BUILD AND USE THE SYSTEMTAP WORKAROUND**

The systemtap countermeasure involves creating a kernel module (like a driver) using a systemtap script that intercepts the vulnerable system call. It is used as a stopgap solution until a fixed kernel is booted into the affected machine. This solution does not require a reboot and applies to RHEL 5, 6 and 7.

It is not possible to make a module that applies to all kernels. Not even for a family (i.e., All RHEL5, 6 or 7). Each specific kernel version requires a .ko generated for that given kernel (uname -r).

**REQUIREMENTS**

In order to build the systemtap module, the following packages are required:

* systemtap-client
* systemtap-devel
* gcc (and dependencies)
* kernel-devel-`uname -r`
* kernel-debuginfo-`uname -r`
* kernel-debuginfo-common-`uname -r`

WARNING: The 'kernel' packages requires the same version as the running kernel. Downloading the latest version will prevent systemtap for working. Please download the exact running version.

**WHERE DO I GET THE DEBUGINFOS**

Please refer to KB <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/9907>

**HOW DO I BUILD THE MODULE**

1. After you installed the packages, create a file named dirtycow.stp with this content:

> > ```
> > probe kernel.function("mem_write").call ? {
> >         $count = 0
> > }
> >
> > probe syscall.ptrace {  // includes compat ptrace as well
> >         $request = 0xfff
> > }
> >
> > probe begin {
> >         printk(0, "CVE-2016-5195 mitigation loaded")
> > }
> >
> >
> > probe end {
> >         printk(0, "CVE-2016-5195 mitigation unloaded")
> > }
> >
> > ```

2. Save the file. Compile it using this command:

> > ```
> > # stap -g -p 4 -m dirtycow_`uname -r|tr -cd [:digit:]` dirtycow.stp
> > dirtycow_26183985.ko
> >
> > ```

In the above example, the .ko file has a number identifying its kernel version. In that case, it is 2.6.18-398.el5. This module can be used in other systems with this exact kernel version without having to install the debuginfo and development packages, needing only systemtap-runtime . Just copy the module file to the server with the same kernel version, install the systemtap-runtime package and proceed from the next step.

3. In order to load the module, run the command staprun -L <.ko file>. For example:

> > ```
> > # staprun -L dirtycow_26183985.ko
> >
> > ```

4. Check if is it loaded:

> > ```
> > # dmesg | grep CVE-2016-5195
> > CVE-2016-5195 mitigation loaded
> >
> > ```

5. To unload the module, reboot the system or run the "staprun -A dirtycow\_26183985" command and interrupt it with Ctlr+C, as shown below:

> > ```
> > # staprun -A dirtycow_26183985
> > ^C
> > Message from syslogd@...
> > kernel:CVE-2016-5195 mitigation unloaded
> >
> > ```

**IMPORTANT**

* The module does not survive a boot: It is not reloaded after a system boot.
* After a reboot, the module must be manually loaded again.
* If the kernel is updated or changed, this module won't be loaded into the new kernel.
* If you booted into a different kernel without the fix, a new compatible module should be loaded.
* A corrected kernel does not need the module load.

Please reference bug  [1384344](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1384344#c13)  for detailed mitigation steps.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:54:18 UTC  ``` A use after free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmsg subsystem.   This may allows remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function.  To attack the kernel using this method the system must be running application using the UDP recvmmsg syscall().  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34b88a68f26a75e4fded796f1a49c40f82234b7d>  Upstream discussion: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8093221/>  Additional Write up: <https://blog.lizzie.io/notes-about-cve-2016-7117.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:55:16 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1382269](show_bug.cgi?id=1382269 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-7117 kernel: Use-after-free in the recvmmsg exit path [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c3)  Wade Mealing    2016-10-27 01:49:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, MRG-2 and realtime and may be addressed in a future update.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-20 11:45:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:2962 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2962.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:06:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0031 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0031.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:09:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0036 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0036.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 07:53:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0065 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0065.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:01:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:0113 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0113.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:19:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0086 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0086.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:24:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0091 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0091.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-26 10:28:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0196 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0196.html>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 12:59:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0215 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0215.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:13:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0217 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0217.html>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:17:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0216 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0216.html>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c37)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-02-15 03:11:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0270 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0270.html>   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c38)  Martin Prpič    2017-02-15 10:48:46 UTC  ``` To exploit this issue, the attacker must be able to leverage a specific setup of the application/socket that is being targeted. In addition, specific timing behavior must be met for the affected code to be in a state where it can be exploited, making the exploitation of this flaw under normal conditions fairly difficult.  In detail, the targeted socket on the remote end must be closed/terminated, which may trigger the error (use-after-free), which then allows for the exploitation to happen.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c43)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-07 08:53:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1489092](show_bug.cgi?id=1489092 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2017-8281 kernel: use after free in the recvmmsg exit path") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

Fix: Apply upstream commit 5dd12c21 which changes the way the \_\_cyles\_2\_ns() does a 64-bit multiplication, thus removing the need for a call to smp\_processor\_id(). Result: Operations with no console warnings due to calls to \_\_cycles\_2\_ns() inside atomic context. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2017-01-17 18:01:11 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

# USN-3126-2: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

11 November 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Ondrej Kozina discovered that the keyring interface in the Linux kernel

contained a buffer overflow when displaying timeout events via the

/proc/keys interface. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-7042](/security/CVE-2016-7042))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability during error

processing in the recvmmsg(2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7117](/security/CVE-2016-7117))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0.1493.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1493.120)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-1493-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1493.120](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1493.120)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0086)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

These updated kernel packages include several security issues and numerous bug fixes, some of which you can see below. Space precludes documenting all of these bug fixes in this advisory. To see the complete list of bug fixes, users are directed to the related Knowledge Article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/2857831.>

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)
* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue and other tcp\_\* functions. This condition could allow an attacker to send an incorrect selective acknowledgment to existing connections, possibly resetting a connection. (CVE-2016-6828, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of the SCTP protocol. A remote attacker could trigger an out-of-bounds read with an offset of up to 64kB potentially causing the system to crash. (CVE-2016-9555, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the performance of Internet Protocol over InfiniBand (IPoIB) was suboptimal due to a conflict of IPoIB with the Generic Receive Offload (GRO) infrastructure. With this update, the data cached by the IPoIB driver has been moved from a control block into the IPoIB hard header, thus avoiding the GRO problem and the corruption of IPoIB address information. As a result, the performance of IPoIB has been improved. (BZ#1390668)
* Previously, when a virtual machine (VM) with PCI-Passthrough interfaces was recreated, a race condition between the eventfd daemon and the virqfd daemon occurred. Consequently, the operating system rebooted. This update fixes the race condition. As a result, the operating system no longer reboots in the described situation. (BZ#1391611)
* Previously, a packet loss occurred when the team driver in round-robin mode was sending a large number of packets. This update fixes counting of the packets in the round-robin runner of the team driver, and the packet loss no longer occurs in the described situation. (BZ#1392023)
* Previously, the virtual network devices contained in the deleted namespace could be deleted in any order. If the loopback device was not deleted as the last item, other netns devices, such as vxlan devices, could end up with dangling references to the loopback device. Consequently, deleting a network namespace (netns) occasionally ended by a kernel oops. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed to ensure the correct order when deleting the virtual network devices on netns deletion. As a result, the kernel oops no longer occurs under the described circumstances. (BZ#1392024)
* Previously, a Kabylake system with a Sunrise Point Platform Controller Hub (PCH) with a PCI device ID of 0xA149 showed the following warning messages during the boot:

"Unknown Intel PCH (0xa149) detected."
 "Warning: Intel Kabylake processor with unknown PCH - this hardware has not undergone testing by Red Hat and might not be certified. Please consult <https://hardware.redhat.com> for certified hardware."

The messages were shown because this PCH was not properly recognized. With this update, the problem has been fixed, and the operating system now boots without displaying the warning messages. (BZ#1392033)

* Previously, the operating system occasionally became unresponsive after a long run. This was caused by a race condition between the try\_to\_wake\_up() function and a woken up task in the core scheduler. With this update, the race condition has been fixed, and the operating system no longer locks up in the described scenario. (BZ#1393719)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

# Android Security Bulletin—October 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published October 03, 2016 | Updated October 04, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Nexus firmware
images have also been released to the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security Patch Levels of October 05, 2016 or later address these
issues. Refer to the
[documentation](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices)
to learn how to check the security patch level. Supported Nexus devices will
receive a single OTA update with the October 05, 2016 security patch level.

Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on September
06, 2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues
have been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues are Critical security vulnerabilities in
device-specific code that could enable remote code execution within the context
of the kernel, leading to the possibility of a local permanent device
compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the
device. The [severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as
[SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-10-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-10-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-10-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-10-01
    and 2016-10-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Nexus devices will receive a single OTA update with the October
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

Security Patch Levels of 2016-10-01 or later address all issues associated with
the 2016-10-01 security patch string level. Security Patch Levels of 2016-10-05
or later address all issues associated with the 2016-10-05 security patch string
level. Refer to the [help center](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705) for
instructions on how to check the security patch level. Device manufacturers that
include these updates should set the patch string level to:
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-10-01] or
[ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-10-05].

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch level
strings?**

This bulletin has two security patch level strings so that Android partners have
the flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level string.

Devices that use the security patch level of October 5, 2016 or newer must
include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security bulletins.

Devices that use the October 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
issues reported in previous security bulletins.

**3. How do I determine which Nexus devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-10-01](#2016-10-01-details) and
[2016-10-05](#2016-10-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Nexus
devices* column that covers the range of affected Nexus devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Nexus devices**: If an issue affects all Nexus devices,
  the table will have “All Nexus” in the *Updated Nexus devices* column.
  “All Nexus” encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player and Pixel C.
* **Some Nexus devices**: If an issue doesn’t affect all Nexus
  devices, the affected Nexus devices are listed in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.
* **No Nexus devices**: If no Nexus devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have “None” in the *Updated Nexus
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)
* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue and other tcp\_\* functions. This condition could allow an attacker to send an incorrect selective acknowledgment to existing connections, possibly resetting a connection. (CVE-2016-6828, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of sctp protocol in which a remote attacker can trigger an out of bounds read with an offset of up to 64kB. This may panic the machine with a page-fault. (CVE-2016-9555, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-514.6.1 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1401863)
* Previously, the device mapper (DM) subsystem was not notified that the real-time kernel changes the way preemption works with spinlocks. This caused a kernel panic when the dm-multipath kernel module was loaded because the interrupt request (IRQ) check was invalid on the real-time kernel. This check has been corrected enabling the system to boot correctly with the dm-multipath module enabled. (BZ#1400930)
* Unlike the standard Linux kernel, the real-time kernel does not disable interrupts inside the Interrupt Service Routines driver. Because of this difference, a New API (NAPI) function for turning interrupt requests (IRQ) off was actually being called with IRQs enabled. Consequently, the NAPI poll list was being corrupted, causing improper networking card operation and potential kernel hangs. With this update, the NAPI function has been corrected to force modifications of the poll list to be protected allowing proper operation of the networking card drivers. (BZ#1402837)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, guest virtual machines (VMs) on a Hyper-V server cluster got in some cases rebooted during the graceful node failover test, because the host kept sending heartbeat packets independently of guests responding to them. This update fixes the bug by properly responding to all the heartbeat messages in the queue, even if they are pending. As a result, guest VMs no longer get rebooted under the described circumstances. (BZ#1397737)
* From Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 to 6.8, the IPv6 routing cache occasionally showed incorrect values. This update fixes the DST\_NOCOUNT mechanism, and the IPv6 routing cache now shows correct values. (BZ#1391973)
* Previously, memory corruption by copying data into the wrong memory locations sometimes occurred, because the \_\_copy\_tofrom\_user() function was returning incorrect values. This update fixes the \_\_copy\_tofrom\_user() function so that it no longer returns larger values than the number of bytes it was asked to copy. As a result, memory corruption no longer occurs in he described scenario. (BZ#1398182)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

net: Fix use after free in the recvmmsg exit pathThe syzkaller fuzzer hit the following use-after-free:
Call Trace:
[<ffffffff8175ea0e>] \_\_asan\_report\_load8\_noabort+0x3e/0x40 mm/kasan/report.c:295
[<ffffffff851cc31a>] \_\_sys\_recvmmsg+0x6fa/0x7f0 net/socket.c:2261
[< inline >] SYSC\_recvmmsg net/socket.c:2281

[<ffffffff86332bb6>] entry\_SYSCALL\_64\_fastpath+0x16/0x7a
arch/x86/entry/entry\_64.S:185
And, as Dmitry rightly assessed, that is because we can drop the
reference and then touch it when the underlying recvmsg calls return
some packets and then hit an error, which will make recvmmsg to set
sock->sk->sk\_err, oops, fix it.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Patch says: Fixes: a2e2725541fa ("net: Introduce recvmmsg socket syscall")  $ git describe --contains a2e2725541fa v2.6.33-rc1~388^2~840  So I would guess 3.0 and newer based kernels are affected.

I see no reason why we should not be affected, but I can't find the problematic code in the SLE 12 SP1 kernel.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-514, which provides a number of security and bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1400193)

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)
* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue and other tcp\_\* functions. This condition could allow an attacker to send an incorrect selective acknowledgment to existing connections, possibly resetting a connection. (CVE-2016-6828, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of sctp protocol in which a remote attacker can trigger an out of bounds read with an offset of up to 64kB. This may panic the machine with a page-fault. (CVE-2016-9555, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, console warnings from the real-time kernel were generated when a sleeping lock was acquired in atomic context. With this update, the code has been modified to not acquire a sleeping lock in this context. As a result, the console warnings are no longer generated. (BZ#1378982)
* Previously, the device mapper (DM) subsystem was not notified that the real-time kernel changes the way preemption works with spinlocks. This caused a kernel panic when the dm-multipath kernel module was loaded because the interrupt request (IRQ) check was invalid on the real-time kernel. This check has been corrected enabling the system to boot correctly with the dm-multipath module enabled. (BZ#1400305)
* Previously, the kernel could sometimes panic due to a possible division by zero in the scheduler. This bug has been fixed by defining a new div64\_ul() division function and correcting the affected calculation in the proc\_sched\_show\_task() function. (BZ#1400975)
* Unlike the standard Linux kernel, the real-time kernel does not disable interrupts inside the Interrupt Service Routines driver. Because of this difference, a New API (NAPI) function for turning interrupt requests (IRQ) off was actually being called with IRQs enabled. Consequently, the NAPI poll list was being corrupted, causing improper networking card operation and potential kernel hangs. With this update, the NAPI function has been corrected to force modifications of the poll list to be protected allowing proper operation of the networking card drivers. (BZ#1401779)

Enhancement(s):

* With this update, the CONFIG\_SLUB\_DEBUG and CONFIG\_SLABINFO kernel configuration options are enabled in the real-time kernel. These options turn on SLUB allocator debugging and slab information tracking, which are helpful when investigating kernel memory allocation problems. (BZ#1357997)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

Use-after-free vulnerability in the \_\_sys\_recvmmsg function in net/socket.c
in the Linux kernel before 4.5.2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via vectors involving a recvmmsg system call that is
mishandled during error processing.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability during error
processing in the recvmmsg(2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:54:18 UTC  ``` A use after free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmsg subsystem.   This may allows remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function.  To attack the kernel using this method the system must be running application using the UDP recvmmsg syscall().  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34b88a68f26a75e4fded796f1a49c40f82234b7d>  Upstream discussion: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8093221/>  Additional Write up: <https://blog.lizzie.io/notes-about-cve-2016-7117.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:55:16 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1382269](show_bug.cgi?id=1382269 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-7117 kernel: Use-after-free in the recvmmsg exit path [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c3)  Wade Mealing    2016-10-27 01:49:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, MRG-2 and realtime and may be addressed in a future update.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-20 11:45:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:2962 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2962.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:06:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0031 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0031.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:09:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0036 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0036.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 07:53:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0065 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0065.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:01:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:0113 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0113.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:19:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0086 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0086.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:24:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0091 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0091.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-26 10:28:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0196 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0196.html>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 12:59:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0215 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0215.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:13:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0217 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0217.html>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:17:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0216 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0216.html>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c37)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-02-15 03:11:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0270 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0270.html>   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c38)  Martin Prpič    2017-02-15 10:48:46 UTC  ``` To exploit this issue, the attacker must be able to leverage a specific setup of the application/socket that is being targeted. In addition, specific timing behavior must be met for the affected code to be in a state where it can be exploited, making the exploitation of this flaw under normal conditions fairly difficult.  In detail, the targeted socket on the remote end must be closed/terminated, which may trigger the error (use-after-free), which then allows for the exploitation to happen.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c43)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-07 08:53:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1489092](show_bug.cgi?id=1489092 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2017-8281 kernel: use after free in the recvmmsg exit path") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A0036)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)
* An out-of-bounds heap memory access leading to a Denial of Service, heap disclosure, or further impact was found in setsockopt(). The function call is normally restricted to root, however some processes with cap\_sys\_admin may also be able to trigger this flaw in privileged container environments. (CVE-2016-4998, Moderate)
* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in tcp\_xmit\_retransmit\_queue and other tcp\_\* functions. This condition could allow an attacker to send an incorrect selective acknowledgment to existing connections, possibly resetting a connection. (CVE-2016-6828, Moderate)

Bug Fix(es):

* When parallel NFS returned a file layout, a kernel crash sometimes occurred. This update removes the call to the BUG\_ON() function from a code path of a client that returns the file layout. As a result, the kernel no longer crashes in the described situation. (BZ#1385480)
* When a guest virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Hyper-V was set to crash on a Nonmaskable Interrupt (NMI) that was injected from the host, this VM became unresponsive and did not create the vmcore dump file. This update applies a set of patches to the Virtual Machine Bus kernel driver (hv\_vmbus) that fix this bug. As a result, the VM now first creates and saves the vmcore dump file and then reboots. (BZ#1385482)
* From Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 to 6.8, the IPv6 routing cache occasionally showed incorrect values. This update fixes the DST\_NOCOUNT mechanism, and the IPv6 routing cache now shows correct values. (BZ#1391974)
* When using the ixgbe driver and the software Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) stack, suboptimal performance in some cases occurred on systems with a large number of CPUs. This update fixes the fc\_exch\_alloc() function to try all the available exchange managers in the list for an available exchange ID. This change avoids failing allocations, which previously led to the host busy status. (BZ#1392818)
* When the vmwgfx kernel module loads, it overrides the boot resolution automatically. Consequently, users were not able to change the resolution by manual setting of the kernel's 'vga=' parameter in the /boot/grub/grub.conf file. This update adds the 'nomodeset' parameter, which can be set in the /boot/grub/grub.conf file. The 'nomodeset' parameter allows the users to prevent the vmwgfx driver from loading. As a result, the setting of the 'vga=' parameter works as expected, in case that vmwgfx does not load. (BZ#1392875)
* When Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 was booted on SMBIOS 3.0 based systems, Desktop Management Interface (DMI) information, which is referenced by several applications, such as NEC server's memory RAS utility, was missing entries in the sysfs virtual file system. This update fixes the underlying source code, and sysfs now shows the DMI information as expected. (BZ#1393464)
* Previously, bonding mode active backup and the propagation of the media access control (MAC) address to a VLAN interface did not work in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8, when the fail\_over\_mac bonding parameter was set to fail\_over\_mac=active. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed so that the VLANs continue inheriting the MAC address of the active physical interface until the VLAN MAC address is explicitly set to any value. As a result, IPv6 EUI64 addresses for the VLAN can reflect any changes to the MAC address of the physical interface, and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) behaves as expected. (BZ#1396479)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1397930#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-23 15:26:49 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of sctp protocol in which a remote attacker can trigger an out of bounds read with an offset of up to 64kB.  This may panic the machine with a page-fault and the out-of-bounds data does not seem to be returned to the remote attacker.  For this attack to be sucessful, the kernel needs to have both the SCTP protocol module loaded and a process listening as an SCTP server.

HID: usbhid: fix inconsistent reset/resume/reset-resume behavior
commit 972e6a993f278b416a8ee3ec65475724fc36feb2 upstream.
The usbhid driver has inconsistently duplicated code in its post-reset,
resume, and reset-resume pathways.
reset-resume doesn't check HID\_STARTED before trying to
restart the I/O queues.
resume fails to clear the HID\_SUSPENDED flag if HID\_STARTED
isn't set.
resume calls usbhid\_restart\_queues() with usbhid->lock held
and the others call it without holding the lock.
The first item in particular causes a problem following a reset-resume
if the driver hasn't started up its I/O. URB submission fails because
usbhid->urbin is NULL, and this triggers an unending reset-retry loop.
This patch fixes the problem by creating a new subroutine,
hid\_restart\_io(), to carry out all the common activities. It also
adds some checks that were missing in the original code:
After a reset, there's no need to clear any halted endpoints.
After a resume, if a reset is pending there's no need to
restart any I/O until the reset is finished.
After a resume, if the interrupt-IN endpoint is halted there's
no need to submit the input URB until the halt has been
cleared.

HID: wacom: fix Bamboo ONE oops
commit 580549ef6b3e3fb3b958de490ca99f43a089a2cf upstream.
Looks like recent changes in the Wacom driver made the Bamboo ONE crashes.
The tablet behaves as if it was a regular Bamboo device with pen, touch
and pad, but there is no physical pad connected to it.
The weird part is that the pad is still sending events and given that
there is no input node connected to it, we get anull pointer exception.

ALSA: usb-audio: Skip volume controls triggers hangup on Dell USB Dock
commit adcdd0d5a1cb779f6d455ae70882c19c527627a8 upstream.
This is Dell usb dock audio workaround.
It was fixed the master volume keep lower.
[Some background: the patch essentially skips the controls of a couple
of FU volumes. Although the firmware exposes the dB and the value
information via the usb descriptor, changing the values (we set the
min volume as default) screws up the device. Although this has been
fixed in the newer firmware, the devices are shipped with the old
firmware, thus we need the workaround in the driver side. -- tiwai]

ALSA: hda - Fix regression of monitor\_present flag in eld proc file
commit 023d8218ec0dfc30e11d4ec54f640e8f127d1fbe upstream.
The commit [bd48128539ab: ALSA: hda - Fix forgotten HDMI
monitor\_present update] covered the missing update of monitor\_present
flag, but this caused a regression for devices without the i915 eld
notifier. Since the old code supposed that pin\_eld->monitor\_present
was updated by the caller side, the hdmi\_present\_sense\_via\_verbs()
doesn't update the temporary eld->monitor\_present but only
pin\_eld->monitor\_present, which is now overridden in update\_eld().
The fix is to update pin\_eld->monitor\_present as well before calling
update\_eld().
Note that this may still leave monitor\_present flag in an inconsistent
state when the driver repolls, but this is at least the old behavior.
More proper fix will follow in the later patch.

Fix by adding a 'set\_power' callback and restoring the default
behaviour prior to commit 918f4cbd4340 ("mmc: sdhci: restore
behavior when setting VDD via external regulator"). The desired
behaviour of that commit is gotten by having sdhci-pxav3 provide
its own set\_power callback.

Btrfs: fix file/data loss caused by fsync after rename and new inode
commit 56f23fdbb600e6087db7b009775b95ce07cc3195 upstream.
If we rename an inode A (be it a file or a directory), create a new
inode B with the old name of inode A and under the same parent directory,
fsync inode B and then power fail, at log tree replay time we end up
removing inode A completely. If inode A is a directory then all its files
are gone too.
Example scenarios where this happens:
This is reproducible with the following steps, taken from a couple of
test cases written for fstests which are going to be submitted upstream
soon:
# Scenario 1
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
mount /dev/sdc /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/a/x
echo "hello" > /mnt/a/x/foo
echo "world" > /mnt/a/x/bar
sync
mv /mnt/a/x /mnt/a/y
mkdir /mnt/a/x
xfs\_io -c fsync /mnt/a/x
The next time the fs is mounted, log tree replay happens and
the directory "y" does not exist nor do the files "foo" and
"bar" exist anywhere (neither in "y" nor in "x", nor the root
nor anywhere).
# Scenario 2
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
mount /dev/sdc /mnt
mkdir /mnt/a
echo "hello" > /mnt/a/foo
sync
mv /mnt/a/foo /mnt/a/bar
echo "world" > /mnt/a/foo
xfs\_io -c fsync /mnt/a/foo
The next time the fs is mounted, log tree replay happens and the
file "bar" does not exists anymore. A file with the name "foo"
exists and it matches the second file we created.
Another related problem that does not involve file/data loss is when a
new inode is created with the name of a deleted snapshot and we fsync it:
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
mount /dev/sdc /mnt
mkdir /mnt/testdir
btrfs subvolume snapshot /mnt /mnt/testdir/snap
btrfs subvolume delete /mnt/testdir/snap
rmdir /mnt/testdir
mkdir /mnt/testdir
xfs\_io -c fsync /mnt/testdir # or fsync some file inside /mnt/testdir
The next time the fs is mounted the log replay procedure fails because
it attempts to delete the snapshot entry (which has dir item key type
of BTRFS\_ROOT\_ITEM\_KEY) as if it were a regular (non-root) entry,
resulting in the following error that causes mount to fail:

Fix this by forcing a transaction commit when such cases happen.
This means we check in the commit root of the subvolume tree if there
was any other inode with the same reference when the inode we are
fsync'ing is a new inode (created in the current transaction).
Test cases for fstests, covering all the scenarios given above, were
submitted upstream for fstests:

ext4: ignore quota mount options if the quota feature is enabled
commit c325a67c72903e1cc30e990a15ce745bda0dbfde upstream.
Previously, ext4 would fail the mount if the file system had the quota
feature enabled and quota mount options (used for the older quota
setups) were present. This broke xfstests, since xfs silently ignores
the usrquote and grpquota mount options if they are specified. This
commit changes things so that we are consistent with xfs; having the
mount options specified is harmless, so no sense break users by
forbidding them.

ext4: add lockdep annotations for i\_data\_sem
commit daf647d2dd58cec59570d7698a45b98e580f2076 upstream.
With the internal Quota feature, mke2fs creates empty quota inodes and
quota usage tracking is enabled as soon as the file system is mounted.
Since quotacheck is no longer preallocating all of the blocks in the
quota inode that are likely needed to be written to, we are now seeing
a lockdep false positive caused by needing to allocate a quota block
from inside ext4\_map\_blocks(), while holding i\_data\_sem for a data
inode. This results in this complaint:
Possible unsafe locking scenario:
CPU0 CPU1

btrfs: fix crash/invalid memory access on fsync when using overlayfs
commit de17e793b104d690e1d007dfc5cb6b4f649598ca upstream.
If the lower or upper directory of an overlayfs mount belong to a btrfs
file system and we fsync the file through the overlayfs' merged directory
we ended up accessing an inode that didn't belong to btrfs as if it were
a btrfs inode at btrfs\_sync\_file() resulting in a crash like the following:

This started happening since commit 4bacc9c9234 (overlayfs: Make f\_path
always point to the overlay and f\_inode to the underlay) and even though
after this change we could still access the btrfs inode through
struct file->f\_mapping->host or struct file->f\_inode, we would end up
resulting in more similar issues later on at check\_parent\_dirs\_for\_sync()
because the dentry we got (from struct file->f\_path.dentry) was from
overlayfs and not from btrfs, that is, we had no way of getting the dentry
that belonged to btrfs (we always got the dentry that belonged to
overlayfs).
The new patch from Miklos Szeredi, titled "vfs: add file\_dentry()" and
recently submitted to linux-fsdevel, adds a file\_dentry() API that allows
us to get the btrfs dentry from the input file and therefore being able
to fsync when the upper and lower directories belong to btrfs filesystems.
This issue has been reported several times by users in the mailing list
and bugzilla. A test case for xfstests is being submitted as well.

fs: add file\_dentry()
commit d101a125954eae1d397adda94ca6319485a50493 upstream.
This series fixes bugs in nfs and ext4 due to 4bacc9c9234c ("overlayfs:
Make f\_path always point to the overlay and f\_inode to the underlay").
Regular files opened on overlayfs will result in the file being opened on
the underlying filesystem, while f\_path points to the overlayfs
mount/dentry.
This confuses filesystems which get the dentry from struct file and assume
it's theirs.
Add a new helper, file\_dentry() [\*], to get the filesystem's own dentry
from the file. This checks file->f\_path.dentry->d\_flags against
DCACHE\_OP\_REAL, and returns file->f\_path.dentry if DCACHE\_OP\_REAL is not
set (this is the common, non-overlayfs case).
In the uncommon case it will call into overlayfs's ->d\_real() to get the
underlying dentry, matching file\_inode(file).
The reason we need to check against the inode is that if the file is copied
up while being open, d\_real() would return the upper dentry, while the open
file comes from the lower dentry.
[\*] If possible, it's better simply to use file\_inode() instead.

sd: Fix excessive capacity printing on devices with blocks bigger than 512 bytes
commit f08bb1e0dbdd0297258d0b8cd4dbfcc057e57b2a upstream.
During revalidate we check whether device capacity has changed before we
decide whether to output disk information or not.
The check for old capacity failed to take into account that we scaled
sdkp->capacity based on the reported logical block size. And therefore
the capacity test would always fail for devices with sectors bigger than
512 bytes and we would print several copies of the same discovery
information.
Avoid scaling sdkp->capacity and instead adjust the value on the fly
when setting the block device capacity and generating fake C/H/S
geometry.

booting when compiled with the upcoming gcc 6. Turns out that turning
a function address into a writable array is undefined and gcc 6 decided
it was OK to omit the store to the first word of the function while
still preserving the store to the second word.
Even though gcc 6 is now fixed to behave more coherently, it is a
mystery that gcc 4 and gcc 5 actually produce wanted code in the kernel.
And in fact the reduced test case to illustrate the issue does indeed
break with gcc < 6 as well.
In any case, let's guard the kernel against undefined compiler behavior
by hiding the nature of the array location as suggested by gcc
developers.

scsi: Do not attach VPD to devices that don't support it
commit 5ddfe0858ea7848c5d4efe3f4319e7543522e0ee upstream.
The patch "scsi: rescan VPD attributes" introduced a regression in which
devices that don't support VPD were being scanned for VPD attributes
anyway. This could cause issues for some devices and should be avoided
so the check for scsi\_level has been moved out of scsi\_add\_lun and into
scsi\_attach\_vpd so that all callers will not scan VPD for devices that
don't support it.

usb: renesas\_usbhs: fix to avoid using a disabled ep in usbhsg\_queue\_done()
commit 4fccb0767fdbdb781a9c5b5c15ee7b219443c89d upstream.
This patch fixes an issue that usbhsg\_queue\_done() may cause kernel
panic when dma callback is running and usb\_ep\_disable() is called
by interrupt handler. (Especially, we can reproduce this issue using
g\_audio with usb-dmac driver.)
For example of a flow:
usbhsf\_dma\_complete (on tasklet)
--> usbhsf\_pkt\_handler (on tasklet)
--> usbhsg\_queue\_done (on tasklet)
\*\*\* interrupt happened and usb\_ep\_disable() is called \*\*\*

mac80211: fix unnecessary frame drops in mesh fwding
commit cf44012810ccdd8fd947518e965cb04b7b8498be upstream.
The ieee80211\_queue\_stopped() expects hw queue
number but it was given raw WMM AC number instead.
This could cause frame drops and problems with
traffic in some cases - most notably if driver
doesn't map AC numbers to queue numbers 1:1 and
uses ieee80211\_stop\_queues() and
ieee80211\_wake\_queue() only without ever calling
ieee80211\_wake\_queues().
On ath10k it was possible to hit this problem in
the following case:
1. wlan0 uses queue 0
(ath10k maps queues per vif)
2. offchannel uses queue 15
3. queues 1-14 are unused
4. ieee80211\_stop\_queues()
5. ieee80211\_wake\_queue(q=0)
6. ieee80211\_wake\_queue(q=15)
(other queues are not woken up because both
driver and mac80211 know other queues are
unused)
7. ieee80211\_rx\_h\_mesh\_fwding()
8. ieee80211\_select\_queue\_80211() returns 2
9. ieee80211\_queue\_stopped(q=2) returns true
10. frame is dropped (oops!)

mac80211: avoid excessive stack usage in sta\_info
commit 0ef049dc1167fe834d0ad5d63f89eddc5c70f6e4 upstream.
When CONFIG\_OPTIMIZE\_INLINING is set, the sta\_info\_insert\_finish
function consumes more stack than normally, exceeding the
1024 byte limit on ARM:
net/mac80211/sta\_info.c: In function 'sta\_info\_insert\_finish':
net/mac80211/sta\_info.c:561:1: error: the frame size of 1080 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
It turns out that there are two functions that put a 'struct station\_info'
on the stack: \_\_sta\_info\_destroy\_part2 and sta\_info\_insert\_finish, and
this structure alone requires up to 792 bytes.
Hoping that both are called rarely enough, this replaces the
on-stack structure with a dynamic allocation, which unfortunately
requires some suboptimal error handling for out-of-memory.
The \_\_sta\_info\_destroy\_part2 function is actually affected by the
stack usage twice because it calls cfg80211\_del\_sta\_sinfo(), which
has another instance of struct station\_info on its stack.

rbd: use GFP\_NOIO consistently for request allocations
commit 2224d879c7c0f85c14183ef82eb48bd875ceb599 upstream.
As of 5a60e87603c4c533492c515b7f62578189b03c9c, RBD object request
allocations are made via rbd\_obj\_request\_create() with GFP\_NOIO.
However, subsequent OSD request allocations in rbd\_osd\_req\_create\*()
use GFP\_ATOMIC.
With heavy page cache usage (e.g. OSDs running on same host as krbd
client), rbd\_osd\_req\_create() order-1 GFP\_ATOMIC allocations have been
observed to fail, where direct reclaim would have allowed GFP\_NOIO
allocations to succeed.

gpio: pxa: fix legacy non pinctrl aware builds
commit c4e5ffb6f224c1a4a9eaad82b19645ec22d1b24f upstream.
In legacy pxa builds, ie. non device-tree and platform-data only builds,
pinctrl is not yet available. As a consequence, the pinctrl gpio
direction change function is a stub, returning always success.
In the current state, the gpio driver direction function believes the
pinctrl direction change was successful, and exits without actually
changing the gpio direction.
This patch changes the logic :
- if the pinctrl direction function fails, gpio direction will report
that failure
- if the pinctrl direction function succeeds, gpio direction is changed
by the gpio driver anyway.
This is sub optimal in the pinctrl aware case, as the gpio direction
will be changed twice: once by pinctrl function and another time by
the gpio direction function.
Yet it should be acceptable in this form, as this is functional for all
pxa platforms (device-tree and platform-data), and moreover changing a
gpio direction is very very seldom, usually in machine initialization,
seldom in drivers probe, and an exception for ac97 reset bug.

pinctrl: sunxi: Fix A33 external interrupts not working
commit 5e7515ba78fff2f5407eaa2f97c1d5c07801ac3d upstream.
pinctrl-sun8i-a33.c (and the dts) declare only 2 interrupt banks,
where as the closely related a23 has 3 banks. This matches with the
datasheet for the A33 where only interrupt banks B and G are specified
where as the A23 has banks A, B and G.
However the A33 being the A23 derative it is means that the interrupt
configure/status io-addresses for the 2 banks it has are not changed
from the A23, iow they have the same address as if bank A was still
present. Where as the sunxi pinctrl currently tries to use the A23 bank
A addresses for bank B, since the pinctrl code does not know about the
removed bank A.
Add a irq\_bank\_base parameter and use this where appropriate to take
the missing bank A into account.
This fixes external interrupts not working on the A33 (tested with
an i2c touchscreen controller which uses an external interrupt).

pins were not initialized.

pinctrl: pistachio: fix mfio84-89 function description and pinmux.
commit e9adb336d0bf391be23e820975ca5cd12c31d781 upstream.
mfio 84 to 89 are described wrongly, fix it to describe
the right pin and add them to right pin-mux group.
The correct order is:
pll1\_lock => mips\_pll -- MFIO\_83
pll2\_lock => audio\_pll -- MFIO\_84
pll3\_lock => rpu\_v\_pll -- MFIO\_85
pll4\_lock => rpu\_l\_pll -- MFIO\_86
pll5\_lock => sys\_pll -- MFIO\_87
pll6\_lock => wifi\_pll -- MFIO\_88
pll7\_lock => bt\_pll -- MFIO\_89

MIPS: Fix MSA ld unaligned failure cases
commit fa8ff601d72bad3078ddf5ef17a5547700d06908 upstream.
Copying the content of an MSA vector from user memory may involve TLB
faults & mapping in pages. This will fail when preemption is disabled
due to an inability to acquire mmap\_sem from do\_page\_fault, which meant
such vector loads to unmapped pages would always fail to be emulated.
Fix this by disabling preemption later only around the updating of
vector register state.
This change does however introduce a race between performing the load
into thread context & the thread being preempted, saving its current
live context & clobbering the loaded value. This should be a rare
occureence, so optimise for the fast path by simply repeating the load if
we are preempted.
Additionally if the copy failed then the failure path was taken with
preemption left disabled, leading to the kernel typically encountering
further issues around sleeping whilst atomic. The change to where
preemption is disabled avoids this issue.

KVM: x86: reduce default value of halt\_poll\_ns parameter
commit 14ebda3394fd3e5388747e742e510b0802a65d24 upstream.
Windows lets applications choose the frequency of the timer tick,
and in Windows 10 the maximum rate was changed from 1024 Hz to
2048 Hz. Unfortunately, because of the way the Windows API
works, most applications who need a higher rate than the default
64 Hz will just do
timeGetDevCaps(&tc, sizeof(tc));
timeBeginPeriod(tc.wPeriodMin);
and pick the maximum rate. This causes very high CPU usage when
playing media or games on Windows 10, even if the guest does not
actually use the CPU very much, because the frequent timer tick
causes halt\_poll\_ns to kick in.
There is no really good solution, especially because Microsoft
could sooner or later bump the limit to 4096 Hz, but for now
the best we can do is lower a bit the upper limit for
halt\_poll\_ns. :-(

KVM: x86: Inject pending interrupt even if pending nmi exist
commit 321c5658c5e9192dea0d58ab67cf1791e45b2b26 upstream.
Non maskable interrupts (NMI) are preferred to interrupts in current
implementation. If a NMI is pending and NMI is blocked by the result
of nmi\_allowed(), pending interrupt is not injected and
enable\_irq\_window() is not executed, even if interrupts injection is
allowed.
In old kernel (e.g. 2.6.32), schedule() is often called in NMI context.
In this case, interrupts are needed to execute iret that intends end
of NMI. The flag of blocking new NMI is not cleared until the guest
execute the iret, and interrupts are blocked by pending NMI. Due to
this, iret can't be invoked in the guest, and the guest is starved
until block is cleared by some events (e.g. canceling injection).
This patch injects pending interrupts, when it's allowed, even if NMI
is blocked. And, If an interrupts is pending after executing
inject\_pending\_event(), enable\_irq\_window() is executed regardless of
NMI pending counter.

mpls: find\_outdev: check for err ptr in addition to NULL check
[ Upstream commit 94a57f1f8a9de90ab4b0f8748361ff8be706c80c ]
find\_outdev calls inet{,6}\_fib\_lookup\_dev() or dev\_get\_by\_index() to
find the output device. In case of an error, inet{,6}\_fib\_lookup\_dev()
returns error pointer and dev\_get\_by\_index() returns NULL. But the function
only checks for NULL and thus can end up calling dev\_put on an ERR\_PTR.
This patch adds an additional check for err ptr after the NULL check.

Same can be triggered with PROVE\_RCU (+ PROVE\_RCU\_REPEATEDLY) enabled
from tun\_attach\_filter() when user space calls ioctl(tun\_fd, TUN{ATTACH,
DETACH}FILTER, ...) for adding/removing a BPF filter on tap devices.
Since the fix in f91ff5b9ff52 ("net: sk\_{detach|attach}\_filter() rcu
fixes") sk\_attach\_filter()/sk\_detach\_filter() now dereferences the
filter with rcu\_dereference\_protected(), checking whether socket lock
is held in control path.
Since its introduction in 994051625981 ("tun: socket filter support"),
tap filters are managed under RTNL lock from \_\_tun\_chr\_ioctl(). Thus the
sock\_owned\_by\_user(sk) doesn't apply in this specific case and therefore
triggers the false positive.
Extend the BPF API with \_\_sk\_attach\_filter()/\_\_sk\_detach\_filter() pair
that is used by tap filters and pass in lockdep\_rtnl\_is\_held() for the
rcu\_dereference\_protected() checks instead.

xfrm: Fix crash observed during device unregistration and decryption
[ Upstream commit 071d36bf21bcc837be00cea55bcef8d129e7f609 ]
A crash is observed when a decrypted packet is processed in receive
path. get\_rps\_cpus() tries to dereference the skb->dev fields but it
appears that the device is freed from the poison pattern.

Following are the sequence of events observed -
- Encrypted packet in receive path from netdevice is queued
- Encrypted packet queued for decryption (asynchronous)
- Netdevice brought down and freed
- Packet is decrypted and returned through callback in esp\_input\_done
- Packet is queued again for process in network stack using netif\_rx
Since the device appears to have been freed, the dereference of
skb->dev in get\_rps\_cpus() leads to an unhandled page fault
exception.
Fix this by holding on to device reference when queueing packets
asynchronously and releasing the reference on call back return.
v2: Make the change generic to xfrm as mentioned by Steffen and

ppp: take reference on channels netns
[ Upstream commit 1f461dcdd296eecedaffffc6bae2bfa90bd7eb89 ]
Let channels hold a reference on their network namespace.
Some channel types, like ppp\_async and ppp\_synctty, can have their
userspace controller running in a different namespace. Therefore they
can't rely on them to preclude their netns from being removed from
under them.

bonding: fix bond\_get\_stats()
[ Upstream commit fe30937b65354c7fec244caebbdaae68e28ca797 ]
bond\_get\_stats() can be called from rtnetlink (with RTNL held)
or from /proc/net/dev seq handler (with RCU held)
The logic added in commit 5f0c5f73e5ef ("bonding: make global bonding
stats more reliable") kind of assumed only one cpu could run there.
If multiple threads are reading /proc/net/dev, stats can be really
messed up after a while.
A second problem is that some fields are 32bit, so we need to properly
handle the wrap around problem.
Given that RTNL is not always held, we need to use
bond\_for\_each\_slave\_rcu().

In the previous patch, the spinlock was not initialized. While it didn't
cause any trouble yet it could be a problem to use it uninitialized.
The most annoying part was the critical section protected by the spinlock
in mvneta\_stop(). Some of the functions could sleep as pointed when
activated CONFIG\_DEBUG\_ATOMIC\_SLEEP. Actually, in mvneta\_stop() we only
need to protect the is\_stopped flagged, indeed the code of the notifier
for CPU online is protected by the same spinlock, so when we get the
lock, the notifer work is done.

ath9k: fix buffer overrun for ar9287
[ Upstream commit 83d6f1f15f8cce844b0a131cbc63e444620e48b5 ]
Code that was added back in 2.6.38 has an obvious overflow
when accessing a static array, and at the time it was added
only a code comment was put in front of it as a reminder
to have it reviewed properly.
This has not happened, but gcc-6 now points to the specific
overflow:
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/eeprom.c: In function 'ath9k\_hw\_get\_gain\_boundaries\_pdadcs':
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/eeprom.c:483:44: error: array subscript is above array bounds [-Werror=array-bounds]
maxPwrT4[i] = data\_9287[idxL].pwrPdg[i][4];
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~
It turns out that the correct array length exists in the local
'intercepts' variable of this function, so we can just use that
instead of hardcoding '4', so this patch changes all three
instances to use that variable. The other two instances were
already correct, but it's more consistent this way.

The warning is correct, but not critical because this appears
to be a write-only variable that is set by each WAN driver but
never accessed afterwards.
I'm taking the minimal fix here, using the correct pointer by
pointing 'mem\_end' to the last byte inside of the register area
as all other WAN drivers do, rather than the first byte outside of
it. An alternative would be to just remove the mem\_end member
entirely.

When an inetdev is destroyed, every address assigned to the interface
is removed. And in this scenerio we do two pointless things which can
be very expensive if the number of assigned interfaces is large:
1) Address promotion. We are deleting all addresses, so there is no
point in doing this.
2) A full nf conntrack table purge for every address. We only need to
do this once, as is already caught by the existing
masq\_dev\_notifier so masq\_inet\_event() can skip this.

This fixes a regression in the bridge ageing time caused by:
commit c62987bbd8a1 ("bridge: push bridge setting ageing\_time down to switchdev")
There are users of Linux bridge which use the feature that if ageing time
is set to 0 it causes entries to never expire. See:

For a pure software bridge, it is unnecessary for the code to have

macvtap: always pass ethernet header in linear
[ Upstream commit 8e2ad4113ce4671686740f808ff2795395c39eef ]
The stack expects link layer headers in the skb linear section.
Macvtap can create skbs with llheader in frags in edge cases:
when (IFF\_VNET\_HDR is off or vnet\_hdr.hdr\_len < ETH\_HLEN) and
prepad + len > PAGE\_SIZE and vnet\_hdr.flags has no or bad csum.
Add checks to ensure linear is always at least ETH\_HLEN.
At this point, len is already ensured to be >= ETH\_HLEN.
For backwards compatiblity, rounds up short vnet\_hdr.hdr\_len.
This differs from tap and packet, which return an error.

Lots of places in the kernel use memcpy(buf, comm, TASK\_COMM\_LEN); but
the result is typically passed to print("%s", buf) and extra bytes
after zero don't cause any harm.
In bpf the result of bpf\_get\_current\_comm() is used as the part of
map key and was causing spurious hash map mismatches.
Use strlcpy() to guarantee zero-terminated string.
bpf verifier checks that output buffer is zero-initialized,
so even for short task names the output buffer don't have junk bytes.
Note it's not a security concern, since kprobe+bpf is root only.

Netdevice parameter hard\_header\_len is variously interpreted both as
an upper and lower bound on link layer header length. The field is
used as upper bound when reserving room at allocation, as lower bound
when validating user input in PF\_PACKET.
Clarify the definition to be maximum header length. For validation
of untrusted headers, add an optional validate member to header\_ops.
Allow bypassing of validation by passing CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO, for instance
for deliberate testing of corrupt input. In this case, pad trailing
bytes, as some device drivers expect completely initialized headers.

xen/events: Mask a moving irq
commit ff1e22e7a638a0782f54f81a6c9cb139aca2da35 upstream.
Moving an unmasked irq may result in irq handler being invoked on both
source and target CPUs.
With 2-level this can happen as follows:
On source CPU:
evtchn\_2l\_handle\_events() ->
generic\_handle\_irq() ->
handle\_edge\_irq() ->
eoi\_pirq():
irq\_move\_irq(data);
/\*\*\*\*\* WE ARE HERE \*\*\*\*\*/
if (VALID\_EVTCHN(evtchn))
clear\_evtchn(evtchn);
If at this moment target processor is handling an unrelated event in
evtchn\_2l\_handle\_events()'s loop it may pick up our event since target's
cpu\_evtchn\_mask claims that this event belongs to it \*and\* the event is
unmasked and still pending. At the same time, source CPU will continue
executing its own handle\_edge\_irq().
With FIFO interrupt the scenario is similar: irq\_move\_irq() may result
in a EVTCHNOP\_unmask hypercall which, in turn, may make the event
pending on the target CPU.
We can avoid this situation by moving and clearing the event while
keeping event masked.

arm64: opcodes.h: Add arm big-endian config options before including arm header
commit a6002ec5a8c68e69706b2efd6db6d682d0ab672c upstream.
arm and arm64 use different config options to specify big endian. This
needs taking into account when including code/headers between the two
architectures.
A case in point is PAN, which uses the \_\_instr\_arm() macro to output
instructions. The macro comes from opcodes.h, which lives under arch/arm.
On a big-endian build the mismatched config options mean the instruction
isn't byte swapped correctly, resulting in undefined instruction exceptions
during boot:

compiler-gcc: disable -ftracer for \_\_noclone functions
commit 95272c29378ee7dc15f43fa2758cb28a5913a06d upstream.
-ftracer can duplicate asm blocks causing compilation to fail in
noclone functions. For example, KVM declares a global variable
in an asm like
asm("2: ... \n
.pushsection data \n
.global vmx\_return \n
vmx\_return: .long 2b");
and -ftracer causes a double declaration.

powerpc/process: Fix altivec SPR not being saved
commit 01d7c2a2de47890934faba91a71d183795e4348d upstream.
In save\_sprs() in process.c contains the following test:
if (cpu\_has\_feature(cpu\_has\_feature(CPU\_FTR\_ALTIVEC)))
t->vrsave = mfspr(SPRN\_VRSAVE);
CPU feature with the mask 0x1 is CPU\_FTR\_COHERENT\_ICACHE so the test
is equivilent to:
if (cpu\_has\_feature(CPU\_FTR\_ALTIVEC) &&
cpu\_has\_feature(CPU\_FTR\_COHERENT\_ICACHE))
On CPUs without support for both (i.e G5) this results in vrsave not
being saved between context switches. The vector register save/restore
code doesn't use VRSAVE to determine which registers to save/restore,
but the value of VRSAVE is used to determine if altivec is being used
in several code paths.

libnvdimm, pfn: fix uuid validation
commit e5670563f588ed1c0603819350c0f02cec23f5c5 upstream.
If we detect a namespace has a stale info block in the init path, we
should overwrite with the latest configuration. In fact, we already
return -ENODEV when the parent uuid is invalid, the same should be done
for the 'self' uuid. Otherwise we can get into a condition where
userspace is unable to reconfigure the pfn-device without directly /
manually invalidating the info block.

s390/mm: handle PTE-mapped tail pages in fast gup
commit fc897c95e91451271cd707ee0f71022b9b201ce9 upstream.
With the THP refcounting rework it is possible to see THP compound tail
pages mapped with PTEs during a THP split. This needs to be considered
when using page\_cache\_get\_speculative(), which will always fail on tail
pages because ->\_count is always zero. commit 7aef4172 "mm: handle
PTE-mapped tail pages in gerneric fast gup implementaiton" fixed it for
the generic fast gup code by using compound\_head(page) instead of page,
but not for s390.
This patch is a 1:1 adaption of commit 7aef4172 for the s390 fast gup
code. Without this fix, gup will fall back to the slow path or fail
in the unlikely scenario that we hit a THP under splitting in-between
the page table split and the compound page split.

powerpc/mm: Fixup preempt underflow with huge pages
commit 08a5bb2921e490939f78f38fd0d02858bb709942 upstream.
hugepd\_free() used \_\_get\_cpu\_var() once. Nothing ensured that the code
accessing the variable did not migrate from one CPU to another and soon
this was noticed by Tiejun Chen in 94b09d755462 ("powerpc/hugetlb:
Replace \_\_get\_cpu\_var with get\_cpu\_var"). So we had it fixed.
Christoph Lameter was doing his \_\_get\_cpu\_var() replaces and forgot
PowerPC. Then he noticed this and sent his fixed up batch again which
got applied as 69111bac42f5 ("powerpc: Replace \_\_get\_cpu\_var uses").
The careful reader will noticed one little detail: get\_cpu\_var() got
replaced with this\_cpu\_ptr(). So now we have a put\_cpu\_var() which does
a preempt\_enable() and nothing that does preempt\_disable() so we
underflow the preempt counter.

ALSA: timer: Use mod\_timer() for rearming the system timer
commit 4a07083ed613644c96c34a7dd2853dc5d7c70902 upstream.
ALSA system timer backend stops the timer via del\_timer() without sync
and leaves del\_timer\_sync() at the close instead. This is because of
the restriction by the design of ALSA timer: namely, the stop callback
may be called from the timer handler, and calling the sync shall lead
to a hangup. However, this also triggers a kernel BUG() when the
timer is rearmed immediately after stopping without sync:
kernel BUG at kernel/time/timer.c:966!
Call Trace:
[] snd\_timer\_s\_start+0x13e/0x1a0
[] snd\_timer\_interrupt+0x504/0xec0
[] ? debug\_check\_no\_locks\_freed+0x290/0x290
[] snd\_timer\_s\_function+0xb4/0x120
[] call\_timer\_fn+0x162/0x520
[] ? call\_timer\_fn+0xcd/0x520
[] ? snd\_timer\_interrupt+0xec0/0xec0
....
It's the place where add\_timer() checks the pending timer. It's clear
that this may happen after the immediate restart without sync in our
cases.
So, the workaround here is just to use mod\_timer() instead of
add\_timer(). This looks like a band-aid fix, but it's a right move,
as snd\_timer\_interrupt() takes care of the continuous rearm of timer.

parisc: Unbreak handling exceptions from kernel modules
commit 2ef4dfd9d9f288943e249b78365a69e3ea3ec072 upstream.
Handling exceptions from modules never worked on parisc.
It was just masked by the fact that exceptions from modules
don't happen during normal use.
When a module triggers an exception in get\_user() we need to load the
main kernel dp value before accessing the exception\_data structure, and
afterwards restore the original dp value of the module on exit.

commit e3893027a300927049efc1572f852201eb785142 upstream.
We want to avoid the kernel module loader to create function pointers
for the kernel fixup routines of get\_user() and put\_user(). Changing
the external reference from function type to int type fixes this.
This unbreaks exception handling for get\_user() and put\_user() when

commit 910cd32e552ea09caa89cdbe328e468979b030dd upstream.
The seccomp filter support requires careful handling of task registers. This
includes reloading of the return value (%r28) and proper syscall exit if
secure\_computing() returned -1.
Additionally we need to sign-extend the syscall number from signed 32bit to
signed 64bit in do\_syscall\_trace\_enter() since the ptrace interface only allows
storing 32bit values in compat mode.

PKCS#7: pkcs7\_validate\_trust(): initialize the \_trusted output argument
commit e54358915d0a00399c11c2c23ae1be674cba188a upstream.
Despite what the DocBook comment to pkcs7\_validate\_trust() says, the
\*\_trusted argument is never set to false.
pkcs7\_validate\_trust() only positively sets \*\_trusted upon encountering
a trusted PKCS#7 SignedInfo block.
This is quite unfortunate since its callers, system\_verify\_data() for
example, depend on pkcs7\_validate\_trust() clearing \*\_trusted on non-trust.
Indeed, UBSAN splats when attempting to load the uninitialized local
variable 'trusted' from system\_verify\_data() in pkcs7\_validate\_trust():
UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in crypto/asymmetric\_keys/pkcs7\_trust.c:194:14
load of value 82 is not a valid value for type '\_Bool'
[...]
Call Trace:
[] dump\_stack+0xbc/0x117
[] ? \_atomic\_dec\_and\_lock+0x169/0x169
[] ubsan\_epilogue+0xd/0x4e
[] \_\_ubsan\_handle\_load\_invalid\_value+0x111/0x158

[] ? \_\_vfs\_read+0x279/0x3d0
[] mod\_verify\_sig+0x1ff/0x290
[...]
The implication is that pkcs7\_validate\_trust() effectively grants trust
when it really shouldn't have.
Fix this by explicitly setting \*\_trusted to false at the very beginning
of pkcs7\_validate\_trust().

This can occur because the SPI controller driver (SPI\_PXA2XX) is built as

kernel would make the problem disappear, it appears prudent to ensure that
the driver is instantiated before accessing its data structures.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Use-after-free vulnerability in the \_\_sys\_recvmmsg function in net/socket.c
in the Linux kernel before 4.5.2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via vectors involving a recvmmsg system call that is
mishandled during error processing.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability during error
processing in the recvmmsg(2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ondrej Kozina discovered that the keyring interface in the Linux kernel

contained a buffer overflow when displaying timeout events via the

/proc/keys interface. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-7042](/security/CVE-2016-7042))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability during error

processing in the recvmmsg(2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7117](/security/CVE-2016-7117))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:54:18 UTC  ``` A use after free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmsg subsystem.   This may allows remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code.  This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within __sys_recvmmsg() function.  To attack the kernel using this method the system must be running application using the UDP recvmmsg syscall().  Upstream patch:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34b88a68f26a75e4fded796f1a49c40f82234b7d>  Upstream discussion: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8093221/>  Additional Write up: <https://blog.lizzie.io/notes-about-cve-2016-7117.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-06 07:55:16 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1382269](show_bug.cgi?id=1382269 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-7117 kernel: Use-after-free in the recvmmsg exit path [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c3)  Wade Mealing    2016-10-27 01:49:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, MRG-2 and realtime and may be addressed in a future update.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-12-20 11:45:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2016:2962 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2962.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:06:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0031 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0031.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-10 17:09:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0036 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0036.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 07:53:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0065 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0065.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:01:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:0113 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0113.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:19:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0086 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0086.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 18:24:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0091 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0091.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-26 10:28:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0196 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0196.html>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 12:59:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0215 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0215.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:13:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0217 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0217.html>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-31 13:17:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0216 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0216.html>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c37)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-02-15 03:11:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2017:0270 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0270.html>   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c38)  Martin Prpič    2017-02-15 10:48:46 UTC  ``` To exploit this issue, the attacker must be able to leverage a specific setup of the application/socket that is being targeted. In addition, specific timing behavior must be met for the affected code to be in a state where it can be exploited, making the exploitation of this flaw under normal conditions fairly difficult.  In detail, the targeted socket on the remote end must be closed/terminated, which may trigger the error (use-after-free), which then allows for the exploitation to happen.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=1382268#c43)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-07 08:53:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1489092](show_bug.cgi?id=1489092 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2017-8281 kernel: use after free in the recvmmsg exit path") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernel's socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, an XFS corruption in some cases occurred on Seagate 8TB drive based volumes after a planned system shutdown or reboot, when a disk write back cache was used. With this update, the megaraid\_sas driver has been fixed and the XFS corruption no longer occurs in the described scenario. (BZ#1398177)
* Previously, booting a kdump kernel in some cases failed with this error:

Kernel panic - not syncing: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on CPU 0.

This update ensures that the hpet timer software counters, including hpet\_default\_delta and hpet\_t1\_cmp, are initialized before an interrupt request is registered, and the kdump kernel now boots without the mentioned error message. (BZ#1404180)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

# RHSA-2016:2962 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2962)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives
a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE
link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating
system.

Security Fix(es):

* A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg

subsystem. This may allows remote attackers to corrupt memory and may allow
execution of arbitrary code. This corruption takes place during the error
handling routines within \_\_sys\_recvmmsg() function. (CVE-2016-7117, Important)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, guest virtual machines (VMs) on a Hyper-V server cluster got in

some cases rebooted during the graceful node failover test, because the host
kept sending heartbeat packets independently of guests responding to them. This
update fixes the bug by properly responding to all the heartbeat messages in the
queue, even if they are pending. As a result, guest VMs no longer get rebooted
under the described circumstances. (BZ#1391167)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in
this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
