Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-7073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of TSIG signatures during an AXFR (Authoritative Zone Transfer) operation in PowerDNS. Specifically, the `AXFRRetriever` component lacks proper checks on TSIG time and fudge values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing TSIG time and fudge value check:** The absence of validation for TSIG time and fudge values in `AXFRRetriever` makes the system susceptible to replay attacks. An attacker could potentially re-use a previously valid, signed AXFR response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Zone Content Alteration:** A successful attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to alter the content of an AXFR, potentially leading to DNS poisoning or other malicious outcomes where an attacker can inject or modify DNS records.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attack requires an attacker to be positioned as a man-in-the-middle, intercepting and manipulating communications between a primary and secondary DNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the DNS servers involved in the AXFR transfer.
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker must be capable of modifying the intercepted packets to inject or alter the AXFR data.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is related to another TSIG issue, CVE-2016-7074, where a missing check for the TSIG record position also allows an attacker to inject additional records.
*   The issue affects PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including versions 3.4.10 and 4.0.1, as well as PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.3.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "Medium" severity.
*   Patches are available for affected versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "Mongo".
