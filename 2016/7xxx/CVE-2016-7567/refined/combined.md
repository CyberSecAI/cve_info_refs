Subject: CVE Request - OpenSLP 2.0 Memory Corruption

Hi,

The following commit fixes a memory corruption bug that I reported in OpenSLP:

<https://sourceforge.net/p/openslp/mercurial/ci/34fb3aa5e6b4997fa21cb614e480de36da5dbc9a/>

Below are the details of the issue:

static int SLPFoldWhiteSpace(size_t len, char * str)
{
      char * p = str, * ep = str + len;
      while (p < ep)
      {
            if (isspace(*p))
            {
                char * ws2p = ++p;
                while (isspace(*p))
                     p++;
                len -= p - ws2p;
                memmove(ws2p, p, ep - p);

The outer while loop checks for p < ep, but lack of bound check in
inner while loop could result in p > ep. This will result in passing a
very large 'size_t len' (ep - p) parameter for memmove().

Could you assign a CVE for this?

MORE BUGS IN OPENSLP-2.0.0
==========================

I discovered some bugs in openslp-2.0.0 back in January, 2018.
One of them I disclosed in June (dumpco.re/blog/openslp-2.0.0-double-free),
and today I'm disclosing two more.

BUG 1
=====

This issue is an OOB read that does not crash the application.
So in terms of exploitation it is not very interesting. If that's what
you're here for then scroll down to bug#2.
After the occurence of the bug the application actually detects the error
and ignores the malicious packet. Therefore, it could be argued that this
is not a bug at all. Nevertheless, here it is:

Proof of concept exploit:

  echo -n "AgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQAATEAAAAAB2VuAAAAF3M=" | base64 -d > /dev/udp/127.0.0.1/427

Valgrind report:

  ==27968== Invalid read of size 1
  ==27968== at 0x412436: GetUINT16 (slp_message.c:63)
  ==27968== by 0x4159C7: v2ParseSrvReg (slp_v2message.c:327)
  ==27968== by 0x4159C7: SLPv2MessageParseBuffer (slp_v2message.c:1005)

  ==27968== by 0x40FC1C: SLPBufferAlloc (slp_buffer.c:67)
  ==27968== by 0x40FCBA: SLPBufferDup (slp_buffer.c:139)
  ==27968== by 0x40BF7F: SLPDProcessMessage (slpd_process.c:1383)
  ==27968== by 0x407139: IncomingDatagramRead (slpd_incoming.c:95)
  ==27968== by 0x407139: SLPDIncomingHandler (slpd_incoming.c:420)
  ==27968== by 0x40256B: main (slpd_main.c:699)

Analysis:

v2ParseSrvReg is responsible for parsing incoming requests. Various bytes
are read from the packet and interpreted as integers used as length fields.
One of them is the scopelistlen, parsed on line 321, and further used as
argument for the amount of bytes to increment the buffer->curpos pointer
in the the GetStrPtr function, shown below on line 112. It now points to
uninitialized memory.

The OOB read occurs in GetUINT16, called on line 327 where the buffer->curpos
pointer is dereferenced.

Subsequently the comparison on line 329 evaluates to true since the
buffer->curpos now points to memory located after the buffer->end
pointer. The application therefore stops processing the malicious packet.

Patch:

I'm not aware of any patch, and I'm not sure the maintainers are going to patch it.

BUG 2
=====

First and foremost, I'm not claiming credit for this bug since it was
apparently discovered by Reno Robert and publicly disclosed on the
oss-security mailing list on 2016-09-27 and awarded CVE-2016-7567
the day after.

openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/27/4
openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/28/1

Anyhow, I wasn't aware of the issue and found it by fuzzing, so I
reported it to the maintainers who made me aware of the earlier discovery.
What puzzled me was that no announcement had been made and the fact that
the latest stable version on their website is still vulnerable! I found it
2017-12-06 and reported it 2018-01-18. See further down for proof of
discovery.

I havn't been able to find any exploit for this bug anywhere. Therefore,
I'm today disclosing a proof-of-concept exploit for the bug to increase
attention on the issue.

The while loop on line 207 fails to perform bounds checking, and as such
may end up incrementing the pointer p up to a point such that p is bigger
than ep. Thus, the third argument to memmove on line 2010 becomes negative.
However, since memmove accepts a size_t (which is unsigned) the value wraps
around and becomes UINT_MAX or close to UINT_MAX resulting in memmove
attempting to move an excessive amount of memory, resulting in OOB write.

the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

As you can see at the end of your post, the error is while compiling  dev-util/pilot-link, which is a dependency of kdepim but is not itself related  to kde.  2. Your compiler recieving a signal 11 isn't, or shouldn't be, related to th  compilation itself. It looks like some internal compiler error - I remeber  someone complaining on irc #gentoo about his compiler recieving signal  11, and it turned out to be flaky ram. Not a cheery thought.  So, maybe you should try rebooting and compiling again. If the same  problem comes up at exactly the same location, my analysis may be  incorrect, but I'm pretty sure. So please try that.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-28 14:39:16 UTC  ``` Tim Haughton just wrote me saying he solved his problem. so I'm closing it. The details of his report follow.---I'm pretty convinced that the problem is not flaky RAM, as I've done thorough tests with a couple of good memory checkers. But I actually resolved the problem about 15 minutes ago.  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-28 14:39:16 UTC  ``` Tim Haughton just wrote me saying he solved his problem. so I'm closing it. The details of his report follow.---I'm pretty convinced that the problem is not flaky RAM, as I've done thorough tests with a couple of good memory checkers. But I actually resolved the problem about 15 minutes ago.  I should have really realised this before sending the bug report, but my memory is like a sieve. - This might be a handy thing to note for you folks on the support side:I have an ASUS A7M266 motherboard, with an Athlon 1.13 gig.I first came across this problem when I gave XP a try on this machine. On 2 different CDs, the installation would always go wrong while copying the files across to the HDD. It would say the file didn't copy properly, and the disk maybe corrupt.I found an obscure reference to this problem on the web site where I got the mobo from. It said that in order to install XP, I had to declock the front side bus from 266 to 200, which has the knock on effect of declocking my processor down to 850MHz. Once it was installed, I could crank it back up again. Sure enough, it worked.It took me a few late nights, cups of coffee, and failed installs of Gentoo to remember this problem. So I did the same thing, declocked the processor and fsb, and sure enough, it installed first time. When the installation was complete, I cranked it back up to full steam and everything was fine.Shortly after I made the bug report, I tried the same thing. Sure enough, no problems.There seems to be an issue with gcc and this mobo. I'm not sure what it is, I'm not even sure where to start looking for an answer. But at least you might be able to recant this solution to fellow sufferers. ``` |  |
