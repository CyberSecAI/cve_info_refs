Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `SLPFoldWhiteSpace` function in `slp_compare.c` of OpenSLP. This function is intended to fold internal whitespace within a string to a single space character.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing bounds check in inner while loop:** The inner `while (isspace(*p))` loop within `SLPFoldWhiteSpace` lacks a check to ensure that the pointer `p` does not exceed the boundary `ep` (end of the string). This allows the pointer `p` to potentially go beyond the allocated memory for the string.
*  **Unsigned Integer Wrap-around:** When the pointer `p` exceeds the boundary and a subtraction of `(p - ws2p)` occurs for the length calculation, it can result in a negative number which will become very large when assigned to an unsigned size_t variable.
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The `memmove` function is called with a potentially incorrect length due to the missing bounds check, causing a large or invalid size to be passed and resulting in an attempt to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** The primary impact is memory corruption due to the out-of-bounds write in `memmove`.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash of the `slpd` daemon, which results in denial of service.
*   **Unspecified impacts:** The vulnerability description mentions "other unspecified impacts," suggesting that the memory corruption could potentially be exploited further, although no specific exploit beyond DoS is described in the provided context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted SLP (Service Location Protocol) message to the vulnerable `slpd` daemon. This is demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept exploits which send a specially crafted UDP packet to port 427.
*   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending the malicious SLP packet over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the machine running the vulnerable `slpd` daemon.
*   **Ability to craft SLP messages:** The attacker must be able to generate SLP packets with specific content to trigger the vulnerability in the `SLPFoldWhiteSpace` function. The provided proof-of-concept exploits show the crafted packet required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Reno Robert.
*  The exploit-db entry also references a separate out-of-bounds read vulnerability (BUG 1) but marks it as not exploitable.
* A patch for the vulnerability is available on sourceforge.net, which addresses the missing bounds check in the inner loop of the `SLPFoldWhiteSpace` function.
* Gentoo Linux released a security advisory (GLSA 201707-05) to address this and other vulnerabilities in OpenSLP, indicating the widespread impact of the issue.
* The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept exploit for the memory corruption vulnerability that can be used to trigger the crash.
