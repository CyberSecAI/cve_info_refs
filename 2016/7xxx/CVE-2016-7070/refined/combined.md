| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1627754#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-11 11:57:14 UTC  ```  A privilege escalation flaw was found in the Ansible Tower. When Tower before 3.0.3 deploys a PostgreSQL database, it incorrectly configures the trust level of postgres user. An attacker could use this vulnerability to gain admin level access to the database.
