# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | This module exploits two vulnerabilities the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance. |
|  |  | The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability via a file delete in logoff.cgi |
|  |  | which resets the admin password back to 'admin' upon a reboot (CVE-2016-7552). |
|  |  | The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin\_sys\_time.cgi |
|  |  | interface (CVE-2016-7547). You have the option to use the authentication bypass or |
|  |  | not since it requires that the server is rebooted. This module has been tested on |
|  |  | version 2.6.1062r1 of the appliance. |
