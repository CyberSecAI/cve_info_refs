Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7547:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin_sys_time.cgi` interface of the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance. Specifically, the `timezone` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `timezone` parameter in `admin_sys_time.cgi` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with root privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable interface (`admin_sys_time.cgi`)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance.
*   **No authentication Required** Although the module has the option to bypass authentication, the command injection vulnerability can also be exploited when logged into the web interface.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable interface:** The attacker needs to know the specific URI and the vulnerable parameter to exploit this flaw (`admin_sys_time.cgi` and `timezone`).

**Additional Details (From Metasploit Module):**

*   The Metasploit module also leverages a separate authentication bypass (CVE-2016-7552) that could reset the admin password back to 'admin', if the device is rebooted, however this is not required to exploit CVE-2016-7547.
*   The module downloads and executes a payload on the target system to achieve a fully interactive meterpreter session.

**Summary:**

The provided content details a critical vulnerability (CVE-2016-7547) in Trend Micro Threat Discovery Appliance, where an attacker can inject commands through the timezone parameter, leading to remote command execution and potential full system compromise. The Metasploit module leverages the vulnerability to gain a reverse shell with root privileges.
