Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-7092:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of Level 3 (L3) page table entries within the Xen hypervisor when dealing with 32-bit PV (Paravirtualized) guest operating systems. Specifically, in PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode, L3 entries are treated as if the USER and RW (Read/Write) bits are set, even if they are not. 
- When running a 32-bit PV guest on a 64-bit Xen, Xen must always OR in the USER and RW bits for L3 updates for the guest to observe architectural behavior.  This is unsafe in combination with recursive page tables. The issue arises because Xen does not properly prevent 32-bit PV guests from creating recursive L3 pagetable mappings. Recursive page tables allow a process to map its own page tables into its address space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper handling of L3 pagetable entries**: Xen incorrectly handles L3 page table entries when a 32-bit PV guest is running on a 64-bit Xen hypervisor.
- **Missing validation**: Xen fails to prevent a 32-bit PV guest from setting up recursive page tables using L3 entries, which are normally not meant to be used that way in PAE mode.
- **Privilege escalation**: The vulnerability allows a malicious guest to manipulate page table mappings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation**: A malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can exploit this to escalate their privileges to that of the host (the Xen hypervisor). This means the attacker could gain control of the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A malicious administrator of a 32-bit PV guest operating system on a 64-bit Xen hypervisor is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack vector involves manipulating the guest's page table entries in memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an administrator of a 32-bit PV guest operating system running on a vulnerable 64-bit Xen hypervisor. They need the ability to control memory allocation and page table setup within their virtualized environment.
- They do not need any network access to the host, as the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating memory within the guest, and how the hypervisor interacts with it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to 64-bit builds of the Xen hypervisor when running 32-bit PV guests on x86 hardware.
- 64-bit PV guests, x86 HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests, and ARM guests are not vulnerable.
