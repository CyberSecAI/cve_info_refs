Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-7382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing permission check in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (specifically within the `nvlddmkm.sys` on Windows and `nvidia.ko` on Linux).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing permissions check: The driver fails to properly validate if the user has the necessary permissions before accessing physical memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of privileges: An attacker can gain access to arbitrary physical memory, potentially leading to the ability to execute code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the kernel mode layer of the NVIDIA display driver, which can be accessed by a local attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access: An attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the NVIDIA driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux systems, with the vulnerable component residing in the kernel-mode driver.
- The content explicitly states "NVIDIAâ€™s risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation."
- The advisory also mentions that NVIDIA is not aware of any exploits in the wild at this time.
