Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a documentation bug in the Crypto++ library. The library's build system used the `-DNDEBUG` flag by default, which disables assertions. However, this requirement was not explicitly documented for users employing alternative build systems like Autotools, CMake, or Eclipse. Consequently, developers using these alternate systems often omitted `-DNDEBUG` leading to debug builds in production environments, where asserts could trigger.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Documentation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of clear documentation stating the necessity of the `-DNDEBUG` flag when using build systems other than the default GNU Make.
- **Unintended Assertion Behavior:**  When `-DNDEBUG` is not defined, asserts are enabled in the code. These asserts are intended for debugging and development purposes and are not meant to be active in production builds.
- **Information Leakage:** When an assert triggers in a debug build, the program will terminate, potentially leading to the creation of core files or error reports.  These files or reports could contain sensitive information which should not be exposed, especially in production environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation of this vulnerability through a triggered assert can lead to the leakage of sensitive information present in the program's memory, which might be included in core dumps or error reports sent to third-party services.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the main focus, a triggered assert will lead to program termination which could result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Improper Build Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered when a developer compiles the Crypto++ library without the `-DNDEBUG` flag when using alternative build systems. This is not an attack in the traditional sense but rather a failure to follow best practices and the library's implicit behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Developer Error:** An attacker doesn't need any special capabilities or position.  The vulnerability is exploited by a developer building the library incorrectly or a malicious user who deliberately omits the `-DNDEBUG` flag during compilation to cause crashes with information leakage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Crypto++ project addressed this issue by adding documentation about the `-DNDEBUG` requirement to `Readme.txt` and `Install.txt`.
- They also introduced `CRYPTOPP_ASSERT`, which requires a user to explicitly enable asserts. This prevents asserts from being enabled by default when `-DNDEBUG` is omitted.
- The issue was triggered by a discussion with the Debian Security Team.
- The project also provided a list of files within the library that contain asserts.
- The project was tracking this issue at [https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/277](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/277).
- CVE-2016-7420 was assigned to track this documentation issue, acknowledging that documentation bugs can have CVEs.
