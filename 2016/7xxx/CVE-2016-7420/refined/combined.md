Subject: Re: Does a documentation bug elevate to CVE status? - Crypto++

Damn, you guys are ruthless...

The Crypto++ project is tracking this at
<https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/277>.

Please make it a public bug/CVE. The Crypto++ project believe in
complete transparency so decision makers can assess risk and and apply
remediations commensurate with their data security posture.

Crypto++ caught a CVE because use of -DNDEBUG was not documented. The
library's build system used -DNDEBUG (like libwebp), but folks who
ported to other build systems did not use it. In my mind's eye, others
who did not use the -DNDEBUG flag should have caught a CVE, not
Crypto++. Also see CVE-2016-7420 and
<<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/520>>.

Crypto++ eventually took away the footgun by supplying its own
CRYPTOPP_ASSERT that required a user to supply a switch to engage
asserts. Asserts were no longer enabled by default when someone
omitted -DNDEBUG. Also see
<<https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/trap.h>>.

I've never seen a CVE for documentation before or since.

For completeness, the asserts are working as expected; they are not broken. The library's build system, [GNU] Make, adds the define. The define is also added by Visual Studio without user intervention. The library is well configured in its default state.

The problem is many distros and developers fail to add `-DNDEBUG` for release/production when using alternate build systems, like Autotools, CMake and Eclipse. Effectively the library receives an alternate set of flags and options, and it is placed in a debug configuration. Sometimes the lack of `-DNDEBUG` is due to policy (Debian and Autotools), and sometimes its due to omission (regular developers under CMake, Eclipse, etc).

Mitre assigned [CVE-2016-7420](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/520) for the issue.

Also see [CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cryptopp-users/ixwCeessWZ8/gv26MxLxNysJ) on the user mailing list. We discussed a library assert over a year ago. We already have it and have been waiting for a good time to cut-over to it.

---

There are 590 asserts in effect when the library is in a debug configuration. [Debug builds are tested](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/cryptest.sh) with out test suite, and none of them trigger when asserts are in effect. The caveat is its not attacker controlled data.

Here's a list of files which could assert in the library when using a debug configuration.

```

    cryptest.exe: misc.h:703: T CryptoPP::rotlMod(T, unsigned int)
        [with T = unsigned int]: Assertion `y <= 255' failed.

The assert is fine. I adore asserts, because they create "self debugging code". When the code tells me where the problem is, I don't have to spend time under a debugger. In code under my purview in real life, we make debug instrumentation a security gate because it so helpful. If code does not have the instrumentation, it cannot be checked in.

The issue I have is Posix's default behavior of "lets crash the program while the developer is debugging it". Its completely useless behavior.

I want to cut-in a CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT. The CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT will do everything assert does, but it will raise a SIG\_TRAP rather than SIG\_ABRT. SIG\_TRAP will snap the debugger if present. If not present, you sometimes get a message on the console. In both cases, the program continues.

You can see an example of the improved assert at <https://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-cplusplus/source/browse/trunk/esapi/EsapiCommon.h> (line 183).

Are there any comments or objections to cutting in a CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT?

I'm fine with this as long as it doesn't change behavior on Windows
/ Visual Studio, which normally catches asserts and uncatched
exceptions by default :)

Yes, it won't muck with Windows. Command line programs running outside a debugger will still crash, IIRC. (Microsoft recognized the problem, and fixed it under the IDE a long time ago).

It works great outside and under the debugger. The program does not crash with a SIGABRT at critical times during the debug cycle.

It looks like the changes to the Visual Studio projects will be limited to adding a header to the appropriate projects (\*.vcproj). Can anyone confirm this looks sane?

I'm not sure if everybody knows this is unix-only behavior.

I think you may missed one CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT...

I'm beginning to wonder if the config setting is even needed. The signal handler is part of cryptest, and not cryptlib, so there's nothing to configure for the library. I think we should always install it.

What \*might\* be more useful is to allow someone to select the signal - SIGTRAP, SIGABRT or some other. Posix uses SIGABRT, and its useless behavior in Debug. SIGTRAP is much more useful in Debug.

In Release mode, asserts should not be in effect, so it does not matter what its set to.

CRYPTOPP\_ASSERT is different than CRYPTOPP\_COMPILE\_ASSERT. But yeah,

give me a minute to fire up MinGW's VM and see what can be done.

What warnings are you using? Is this at -Wall and higher?

Note that you might be hitting this GCC bug:

<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53431>. There's nothing we

can do about that. From comment 13

(<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53431#c13>):

 This issued caused Crypto++ to remove -Wall (and above)

 under GCC. Crypto++ is C++ with lots of interfaces, and it

 performs a fair amount of intermediate calculations used in

 an assert. It really needed the following to work as expected:

 // GCC diagnostcs available after GCC 4.2

(<https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2015-07/msg00063.html>)

 #define GCC\_DIAGNOSTIC\_AWARE ((\_\_GNUC\_\_ > 4 || (\_\_GNUC\_\_ == 4 &&

\_\_GNUC\_MINOR\_\_ >= 2)) || defined(\_\_clang\_\_))

 #if GCC\_DIAGNOSTIC\_AWARE

 # pragma GCC diagnostic push

 # pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-value"

 # pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-variable"

 #endif

I offered to pay one of the GCC devs a bounty to fix it. No takers yet.

Yeah, you'll need to send something that gives us something to latch onto to begin investigating. An output from a compile would be nice.

> I can't say for sure right now, but there were unused StringNarrow method and unused \*p pointer. I'll send more details tomorrow.

I haven't seen those in a while.

I thought StringNarrow (from misc.h) was cleared at <https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/commit/a0390f1fd725e37a201cc47ba47204182ebc1ccf>. I thought the unused ptr (from argparams.h) was cleared at <https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/commit/5f25c7363534656ce6e1ecac63ca694e6d4ba7d6>.

Are you using the latest sources from either SVN or GitHub?

We've cleared a lot of issues in the last month or two. There is no updated ZIP file.

In fact, the 5.6.2 ZIP file was stale as soon as Wei pushed the first update after building it. That was a couple of years ago.

You might consider switching to GitHub. Moving forward, that's the delivery platform of choice.

Its good that Zooko got us to move to GiHub. SourceForge is still down. Its been 8 days and counting. <https://twitter.com/sfnet_ops>.

Damn, sorry about that. Firing up the Windows VM is still on the short

What problem is that?

Looking at the two threads dated July 26, they are "Fwd: AlgorithmParameters and noexcept patch" and "INSTALL added". The first issue was cleared, the secondwtopic was informational.

(Its hard to follow some of your threads because you start a new topic on an unrelated thread on occasion rather than starting a new thread).

I am messaging from a mobile device, thus I cannot make a quote. Scroll this topic up until you see a call stack screenshot.Reply allReply to authorForward0 new messages

Use CVE-2016-7420 for this Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) vulnerability.

In general, documentation bugs can have CVEs. Maybe the easiest
example to find is CVE-2010-4179.
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/10/12> is another
example of how misleading documentation can have a CVE.

Here's a recent one:
