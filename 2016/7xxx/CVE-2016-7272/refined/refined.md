Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-7272

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the way the Windows Graphics component handles objects in memory. Specifically, it's caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing icon files, leading to an integer overflow before writing to memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Integer overflow vulnerability in the processing of icon files.
*   Improper memory handling by the Windows Graphics component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   Complete system compromise: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-based attack:**
    *   An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the website.
*   **File-sharing attack:**
    *   An attacker could provide a specially crafted malicious document or icon file.
    *   The attacker would need to convince a user to open the malicious file or folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or provide a malicious file/folder to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious content by either visiting a webpage or opening the crafted document or folder.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the Windows Graphics component.
*   The issue results from improper validation of user-supplied data.
*   Microsoft has released a security update to address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is rated as **Critical** due to its potential for remote code execution. Users with fewer privileges might be less affected than users with administrative rights.
