Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7522:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2016-7522, as it is mentioned by CVE ID in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry and in the Openwall mailing list discussion which specifically assigns CVE-2016-7522 to an "out of bound access for malformed psd file" issue in ImageMagick. The various bug reports and commit logs also confirm this relationship.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing or insufficient bounds check when processing PSD (Photoshop Document) files. Specifically, the `LocaleNCompare` function, used within `ReadPSDImage`, attempts a string comparison on a buffer without properly validating its size, leading to out-of-bounds reads.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow when the `LocaleNCompare` function reads beyond the allocated memory. This is confirmed by AddressSanitizer reports in the Launchpad and GitHub issues.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability manifests as an out-of-bounds read during a string comparison, as detailed in the bug reports.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the application, leading to denial of service. The AddressSanitizer reports clearly show the program aborting due to the heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in these documents, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PSD file:** A specially crafted PSD file is the attack vector. The malformed file contains invalid or unexpected data that triggers the out-of-bounds read in `ReadPSDImage`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malformed PSD file:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PSD file to the vulnerable ImageMagick installation. This could be through a web interface, email attachment, or any means of allowing user input to be processed by ImageMagick.
*   **No special privileges:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges on the system where ImageMagick is running.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** While not strictly required, a successful exploit is facilitated with knowledge of the vulnerability and how to craft the malicious PSD file to trigger it.
*   **Software:** The attacker requires knowledge of the version of ImageMagick software to be attacked.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `MagickCore/locale.c:1517` (in `LocaleNCompare`), when called by `coders/psd.c:1940` (in `ReadPSDImage`).
*   The crash occurs due to an out-of-bounds read when comparing a string in the PSD file header (specifically, checking if it starts with "8BIM") without first checking the size of the buffer against the comparison length.
*   The fix involves adding an extra check in `coders/psd.c` to ensure the provided length is at least 4 bytes before attempting the comparison.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with `afl-fuzz`.
*   The bug was fixed in ImageMagick commit `4b1b9c0522628887195bad3a6723f7000b0c9a58`.
*   Red Hat considers this a low-severity security issue that is not planned to be addressed in future updates for their older distributions. However, the vulnerability was fixed in newer versions of the software.
*   The vulnerability was reported and fixed upstream at <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/93>.

In summary, CVE-2016-7522 is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick triggered by a malformed PSD file, resulting in an out-of-bounds read during string comparison, potentially leading to a denial of service.
