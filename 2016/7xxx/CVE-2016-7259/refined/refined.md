Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in the provided content, specifically from the blog.quarkslab.com article, which gives a detailed analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Windows kernel-mode driver `win32k.sys` not properly validating the size of a `.pfb` (Printer Font Binary) file when loading a PostScript Type 1 font (`.pfm` file). Specifically, if the associated `.pfb` file is empty (0 bytes), a NULL pointer dereference occurs, leading to a system crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not check if the `.pfb` file size is zero before attempting to create a memory section for it, causing the `nt!ZwCreateSection` call to fail.
* **Unchecked Error Handling:** While the `bCreateSection` and `EngMapFontFileFDInternal` functions correctly return an error when the section creation fails, this error is not properly propagated back to the caller function `PUBLIC_PFTOBJ::bLoadFonts` which results in a pointer being zeroed and subsequently dereferenced.
* **Null Pointer Dereference:** When an empty .pfb file is encountered, the code attempts to dereference a null pointer which leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a system crash (Blue Screen of Death - BSOD), making the system unusable.
*   **Elevation of Privilege (Indirect):** While the vulnerability itself doesn't directly allow privilege escalation, the ability to crash the system may be a component of a more complex attack chain. This is noted in the Microsoft Security Bulletin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to run a specially crafted application that uses the vulnerable API on the target system.
*   **File System:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted `.pfm` font file and an associated empty `.pfb` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to provide crafted font files to the vulnerable function.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs within the `win32k!PUBLIC_PFTOBJ::bLoadFonts` function when it attempts to dereference a pointer that has become NULL due to the failed mapping of a zero-sized .pfb file.
*   The crash occurs specifically at the instruction `test byte ptr [ecx+18h], 8` within `win32k!PUBLIC_PFTOBJ::bLoadFonts`, where `ecx` is a NULL pointer.
*   The vulnerable API is `win32k!NtGdiAddFontResourceW`.
*   The function `win32k!bCreateSection` uses `nt!ZwQueryInformationFile` to get file info, but doesn't check for a 0 size.
*   The crash happens during the second file loading pass (for the PFB file).
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by adding a font resource through the vulnerable API

**Mitigation:**
*   Newer Windows systems have NULL pointer dereference protection which prevents the allocation of memory at address 0. This does mitigate this particular exploit.
*   The official patch addresses the vulnerability by correctly handling objects in memory and preventing unintended elevation from user-mode (as stated in MS16-151).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes details such as the call stack, register values, and code snippets which offer deep insights into the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing the Windows kernel.
* The `packetstormsecurity.com`, `blogs.technet.microsoft.com` and  `technet.microsoft.com` content are mostly unrelated to the actual vulnerability, with `technet.microsoft.com` and `docs.microsoft.com` containing mostly the official security bulletin.
* This vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows versions (Windows Vista to Windows 10 and Windows Server equivalents).
