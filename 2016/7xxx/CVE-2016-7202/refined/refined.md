{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of the JavaScript Array.reverse method within chakra.dll. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow can occur due to an inconsistency in how the array length is handled during the reverse operation. The size of the array can be changed by a property getter during the reverse operation, leading to an incorrect size calculation for the array segment, and ultimately a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Incorrect size calculation",
      "Improper handling of array length",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain control of the system, install programs, view or modify data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage containing specially crafted JavaScript",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or deliver a malicious webpage or file that exploits the vulnerability. User interaction is required, meaning that the victim needs to visit the malicious content using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs within the `JavascriptArray::EntryReverse` function when the length of the array is stored, and then passed into `JavascriptArray::ReverseHelper`.  A property getter can change the array's size when FillFromPrototypes is called in `ReverseHelper`, leading to a large value being calculated for `seg->left`. This large value results in the segment length exceeding segment size when `SparseArraySegmentBase::EnsureSizeInBound` is called. When setting an element of the array methods assume that the allocated size is less than the length, and allocate size bytes while copying length bytes leading to a heap overflow."
