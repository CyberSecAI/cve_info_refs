Subject: CVE-2016-7903: Dotclear <= 2.10.2 Password Reset Address Spoof

Vulnerability: Dotclear <= 2.10.2 Password Reset Address Spoof
CVE: CVE-2016-7903
Discovered by: Hongkun Zeng (<http://www.dbappsecurity.com.cn/>)

Dotclear is an open source blog publishing application distributed under the GNU GPLv2.

The vulnerability can be triggered only if the Host header is not part of the web server routing process (e.g. if several domains are served by the same web server). This can lead to phishing attacks because of the modification of the site's links. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the host in reset password address.)

Fix commit: <https://hg.dotclear.org/dotclear/rev/bb06343f4247>

A tiny update to fix two minor security vulnerabilities and to allow some specific proxy/ssl server configuration.

Your dashboard should also offer you to upgrade your installation today or tomorrow (depending on your settings). There's also a [patch](http://download.dotclear.org/patches/2.10.2-2.10.3.diff.gz) for the developers who prefer this method.
