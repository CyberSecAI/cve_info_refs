Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the Host header in password reset functionality within Dotclear versions 2.10.2 and earlier. Specifically, if the webserver does not use the Host header as part of the routing process, a malicious actor can manipulate the Host header. This allows the attacker to control the domain used in the password reset email link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Host Header Injection:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the Host header when generating password reset URLs.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of the Host header leads to the ability to inject arbitrary domain names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can spoof the password reset address, redirecting users to a malicious page controlled by them. This can lead to credential theft and unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated Host Header:** An unauthenticated attacker can send a password reset request with a crafted Host header, thereby modifying the domain in the password reset link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Dotclear server.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Web Server Configuration:** The webserver needs to be configured such that it does not use the Host header for routing or filtering purposes. This means the vulnerability is not always exploitable, but it is in certain common server configurations.
