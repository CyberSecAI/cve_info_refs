Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Windows' improper handling of NTLM password change requests. Specifically, a weakness exists in how the system manages the password change cache within the NTLM authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of NTLM password change requests.
- Insufficient hardening of the password change cache within the NTLM authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges from a regular user account to an administrator level.
- **System Compromise:** Once elevated, the attacker can perform a wide range of actions, including:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the target system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must authenticate to a domain-joined system using valid user credentials.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to manipulate NTLM authentication requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must have valid user credentials on the target system.
-  The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- The target system must be domain joined.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the NTLM authentication protocol within Windows.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by hardening the NTLM password change cache.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
- There are no identified mitigations or workarounds for this vulnerability.
