Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the C software implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) within wolfSSL versions 3.9.8 and earlier. Specifically, during the ECC point doubling operation, the implementation uses a different variable depending on the key state. This, coupled with a failure to properly consider cache bank monitoring, creates a weakness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cache-Timing Side-Channel:** The core weakness is a timing side-channel vulnerability. The use of different variables during point doubling, combined with the lack of proper cache bank access time consideration, leads to timing differences based on the key state. This can be exploited through careful observation of cache hits and misses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Key Disclosure:** A local attacker can potentially discover the private ECC keys by analyzing the timing differences observed through cache-bank monitoring.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires the adversary to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable wolfSSL library is being used.
- **CPU Core Sharing:** The attacker's crafted application must run on the same CPU core as the victim's process that is using the vulnerable ECC implementation. This is necessary to observe the timing variations related to the shared CPU cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the same machine as the victim.
- **Co-location on CPU Core:** The attacker's code must be scheduled on the same CPU core as the process utilizing the vulnerable ECC implementation.
- **Cache Monitoring:** The attacker must be able to monitor cache hits and misses to detect the timing differences during ECC operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a "medium level" security vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects users of wolfSSL who utilize ECC private keys, including those using VM's, hyper-threading, or in environments with shared CPU caches with a potential attacker.
- The fix was released in wolfSSL version 3.9.10.
