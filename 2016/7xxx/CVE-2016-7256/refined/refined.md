Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows font library's improper handling of specially crafted embedded fonts. Specifically, the issue lies in how the library parses and processes these fonts, leading to exploitable conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The core vulnerability is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw. Due to the improper handling of embedded fonts, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Memory Corruption:** While not directly stated as the root cause, the document does mention that other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-7205 and CVE-2016-7217) within the same patch address memory corruption issues, suggesting that memory corruption may be involved in the exploitation of CVE-2016-7256

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Varying Impact based on User Rights:** Users with fewer user rights are less impacted compared to those with administrative privileges; however, the vulnerability can still lead to significant compromises for all user types.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a specially crafted embedded font. By convincing a user to visit this site, they can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker has to rely on user interaction to get them to the website.
- **File Sharing Attacks:** An attacker can deliver a specially crafted document containing a malicious embedded font. Opening this document would trigger the vulnerability on the victim's machine. The attacker has to rely on user interaction to get them to open the document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or distribute a crafted file to reach potential victims.
- **Social Engineering:** Exploitation requires convincing the user to visit a website or open a file. Social engineering tactics (phishing emails or instant messages) are likely necessary for the attacks to be successful.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" on all supported versions of Microsoft Windows.
- The vulnerability was reportedly exploited in the wild.
- The provided document suggests that the security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows font library handles the embedded fonts.
- The document references a workaround for CVE-2016-7210 (Open Type Font Information Disclosure Vulnerability), which involves disabling/renaming the ATMFD.dll component. This is presented as a temporary workaround for the Remote Code Execution vulnerability in CVE-2016-7256.
