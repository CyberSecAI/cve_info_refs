Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A malformed QNX6 QNET packet can cause a crash in the Wireshark dissector for this protocol. Specifically, a change in byte 0x50, representing the address length, from 0x10 to 0x02 in the QNET packet triggers the crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of specific address lengths within the QNX6 QNET dissector. The dissector does not properly validate the address length, leading to a crash when an unexpected value is encountered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This could lead to denial-of-service if an attacker can inject the malformed packets or induce a user to open a malicious capture file, potentially disrupting network analysis activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network injection:** An attacker could inject malformed QNET packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious packet trace files:** An attacker could provide a malicious packet trace file containing crafted QNET packets to a user, who would then open it in Wireshark, triggering the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to inject network packets if targeting a live capture.
*   Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted packet capture file to a victim.

**Additional Details:**
*   The specific vulnerability was found via fuzzing.
*   The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 2.0.0 to 2.0.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark version 2.0.6.
* The attached pcap file shows a modified packet that triggers the crash.
