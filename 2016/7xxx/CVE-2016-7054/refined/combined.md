This is the write up for Pasteurize Google CTF 2020 challenge from the perspective of someone who does not routinely do CTFs. A friend of mine teamed up with me and even though we did not go that far, we had fun and learned something.   Challenge description In this challenge, we get a URL: https://pasteurize.web.ctfcompetition.com/ and a description that says: This doesn’t look secure. I wouldn’t put even the littlest secret in here. My source tells me that third parties might have implanted it with their little treats already. Can you prove me right? On this website, we can...

In this post, I’m going to go over my short journey to setup my PHP development environment on Windows 10. I will tell you how to setup PHPStorm to debug PHP applications using XDebug and PHP setup over Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on WSL2. I would like to work against the latest version of PHP and compile it myself. At the same time, setting up extensions and compiling PHP itself on windows is not a very straightforward task as far as I know. The plan is to have the development environment run from Linux (WSL2) while the IDE, which is PHPStorm...

PHP-CFG is PHP project developed by Anthony Ferrara. It uses PHP-Parser to generate the AST from the PHP code. Then transforms this into another intermediate representation in the form of a control flow graph. This enables us an easy way to traverse this graph and reason about the execution of the underlying PHP code. Getting started To get started, you’d need to know some basic compiler concepts. The audience of this post are people from a variety of backgrounds so I’ll try to cover as much as possible. If some concepts don’t make sense through out the text, it is...

As PhD students or grant writers, I’m sure we have all been there. You need to squeeze in two more paragraphs into the text and stay under the 12 page limits. Sometimes you can throw away another paragraph that is not so necessary. Other times you can rephrase multiple sentences and save several lines. Shrinking figures is always an option. You know what’s worse? Resubmitting a paper to a conference with a less forgiving template in terms of space, or just a smaller page limit. Once the idea is shaped and the text is written, it is indeed harder to...

I was working on a project which required implementation of PHP builtin functions. To understand the scope of the project and its implementation effort I thought it is a good idea to get an estimate of the total number of these functions, and also, how frequently they are used among popular PHP applications. This would give me a rough idea of how many functions I need to implement myself. At the same time, the results can be leveraged to get insight into debloating effectiveness for these applications. Which is something that I’ve been working on for over a year now....

JavaScript crypto miners have been around for quite a while. Monero (XMR), the crypto currency mined by these scripts was released in April 2014. As shown in the following figure, the increase in price of Bitcoin was coupled with increase in price of Ethereum and Monero. This jump led to these in browser miners being over emphasized in the media. Advertisements being replaced by miners Website administrators started including miner scripts in their websites. The more the user stays on the website, the more Monero mined. Coinhive review: Embeddable JavaScript Crypto Miner – 3 days in [1] shows that using...

Introduction During the past couple of weeks, we have seen a rise in public abuse of Shadowbrokers’ leaked exploits allegedly used by the NSA, a handful of these exploits target windows operating system and gives attackers the ability to reliably penetrate into windows boxes! Eternalblue is the name of the exploit that targeted SMB 445 port on windows operating systems that gave you RCE, it was patched by Microsoft a couple of days before the leak but many systems were left vulnerable over the internet, in addition to that, windows XP and 2003 which are no longer supported by Microsoft...

I’m officially contributing to telescam.ir project where we analyze the growing trend of android malware and scam campaigns spreading via Telegram messenger in Iran. Since Telegram is the dominant messaging application used by Iranians, scammers have built their tools and services on top of this infrastructure. We have observed scam campaigns where they take your money but don’t deliver the service they promised and we have also observed the case where various social engineering techniques are used to get access to client contacts or add them to their advertisement channels. These guys are operating channels with 170,000+ members, and using...

In this blog post I’m going to discuss the XSS vulnerability that I found in sslcheck.certcc.ir. Certcc has developed its own SSL configuration assessment service (like SSLLabs.com). The good point about this is that websites that are only reachable from Iran’s IP addresses can be tested using this service. I was playing around with this website to see how it works in contrast to SSLLabs.com, I found out that it gives you much more options like entering ip addresses, testing custom ports and also testing services that work with SSL like SMTP, IMAP and POP3. There was a part of...

The story – Smelly Smelly apk One of my colleagues came to me with an apk (Android application), he said he can’t make it work on his Genymotion emulator but he’s 100% certain it’s an Iranian malware. Based on his observation the guy behind this application was spending more than 500$ daily to spread this app on Telegram messenger public channels, he was basically paying channel administrators with huge number of members to advertise and spread his application.

1. Description

Remote unauthenticated user can negotiate ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites and send a message of sufficient length with a bad MAC to trigger the vulnerable code to zero out the heap space and force the vulnerable OpenSSL instance to crash.

https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/11/23/analysis-of-openssl-chacha20-poly1305-heap-buffer-overflow-cve-2016-7054
https://www.silverf0x00.com/overview-of-mac-algorithms-fuzzing-tls-and-finally-exploiting-cve-2016-7054-part-1/

2. Proof of Concept

 a. Download and compile OpenSSL 1.1.0a or b
 b. Run OpenSSL with the following switches: ./openssl-1.1.0a/bin/openssl s_server -cipher 'DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305' -key cert.key -cert cert.crt -accept 443 -www -tls1_2 -msg
 c. Download and run the exploit code (Under https://github.com/silverfoxy/tlsfuzzer package run test-cve-2016-7054.py at https://github.com/silverfoxy/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-cve-2016-7054.py)
 d. OpenSSL Instance crashes causing DOS

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [10 Nov 2016]
========================================
ChaCha20/Poly1305 heap-buffer-overflow (CVE-2016-7054)
======================================================
Severity: High
TLS connections using \*-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS
attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This
issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0c
This issue does not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.0
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 25th September 2016 by Robert
ÅwiÄcki (Google Security Team), and was found using honggfuzz. The fix
was developed by Richard Levitte of the OpenSSL development team.
CMS Null dereference (CVE-2016-7053)
====================================
Severity: Moderate
Applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer
dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type
in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure
callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE
structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0c
This issue does not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.0
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 12th October 2016 by Tyler Nighswander of
ForAllSecure. The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL
development team.
Montgomery multiplication may produce incorrect results (CVE-2016-7055)
=======================================================================
Severity: Low
There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery
multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but
longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA
and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in
question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input
of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as
transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible
erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input.
Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one
presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in
detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely
multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to
share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour.
Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0c
This issue does not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2. Due to the low
severity of this defect we are not issuing a new 1.0.2 release at this time.
We recommend that 1.0.2 users wait for the next 1.0.2 release for the fix to
become available. The fix is also available in the OpenSSL git repository in
commit 57c4b9f6a2.
This issue was publicly reported as transient failures and was not
initially recognized as a security issue. Thanks to Richard Morgan for
providing reproducible case. The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of
the OpenSSL development team.
Note
====
As per our previous announcements and our Release Strategy
(https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html), support for OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 will cease on 31st December 2016. No security updates for that
version will be provided after that date. Users of 1.0.1 are advised to
upgrade.
Support for versions 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 ended on 31st December 2015. Those
versions are no longer receiving security updates.
