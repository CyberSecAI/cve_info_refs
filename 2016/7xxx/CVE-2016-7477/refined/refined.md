Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an invalid memory access within the `ff_put_pixels8_xy2_mmx` function, located in `rnd_template.c` of the Libav library.
- The root cause appears to be a memory access issue, initially misidentified as a null pointer dereference and later corrected to invalid memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Invalid memory access:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read or write in memory during pixel manipulation. The `ff_put_pixels8_xy2_mmx` function accesses memory locations that it should not, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the application (avconv) when processing a crafted H.263 video file. This constitutes a denial-of-service vulnerability, making it impossible for the application to complete its task.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, memory access violations can, in some cases, be leveraged for more severe exploits (e.g., code execution) if the memory corruption is controllable. This is not elaborated upon here.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malformed input file:** The attack vector is a crafted H.263 video file (specifically, the `70.crashes` file mentioned).
- The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding process of this malformed file using the `avconv` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide input to Libav:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specifically crafted H.263 file to an application using the vulnerable version of the Libav library (e.g., through file upload, network stream, etc.).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
