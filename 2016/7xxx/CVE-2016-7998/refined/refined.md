Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of file names, specifically regarding quotation marks, within the template compiler/composer of SPIP. This lack of proper escaping could lead to the generation of invalid code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **PHP Code Injection:** The core vulnerability is that by injecting unescaped double quotes into file names, attackers can manipulate the generated PHP code in templates, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File Names:** The attack vector is through the inclusion of file names with crafted double quotes within the SPIP template compilation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to File Upload or Creation:** An attacker needs to be able to upload files, or in some way control file names that will be processed by the SPIP template compiler.
