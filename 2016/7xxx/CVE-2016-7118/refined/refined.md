Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A Debian-specific patch in the Linux kernel, introduced in the upgrade from version 3.2.78-1 to 3.2.81-1, added support for the `SETFL` fcntl operation. This patch introduced a bug where calling `fcntl` with the `F_SETFL` flag on a directory within an AUFS filesystem would result in a kernel oops (crash).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect implementation of `fcntl(F_SETFL)` handling for directories in the AUFS filesystem.
- The `aufs_file_fop` structure correctly handles the `setfl` operation, while `aufs_dir_fop` lacks this implementation. This discrepancy leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability causes a kernel crash (oops), making the system unusable.
- This crash can be triggered by local users with access to the AUFS filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to a system with an affected kernel version and AUFS filesystem.
- An attacker needs to issue an `fcntl` system call with the `F_SETFL` flag on a directory within the AUFS filesystem.
- Example: `fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY);` on a directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code that can call the `fcntl` system call with specific arguments on a file descriptor referencing a directory within an AUFS filesystem.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug is specific to Debian's kernel patch and is not present in the upstream kernel or AUFS code.
- The vulnerability was identified when performing operations such as copying files from an AUFS filesystem using `scp`.
- The crash occurs in the kernel's `fs/fcntl.c` file.
- The specific code difference lies in the `aufs_file_fop` and `aufs_dir_fop` structures, where `aufs_dir_fop` does not handle the `setfl` operation.
