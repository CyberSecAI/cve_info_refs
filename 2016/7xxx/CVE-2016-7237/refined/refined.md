{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by a null pointer dereference within the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) when processing specially crafted NTLM messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The LSASS service does not properly validate inputs during the NTLM authentication process, specifically when handling ASN.1 encoded data.",
      "The service attempts to use a null pointer, 'creds', leading to the crash."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition leading to the target system becoming unresponsive and requiring a reboot. Additionally, the vulnerability might allow for local privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via SMBv1 and SMBv2 during the NTLM message 3 (Authenticate) message.",
        "Attackers can send crafted NTLM messages with a large ASN.1 length field (0x84) to allocate a large chunk of memory and long string fields (User, Domain, etc.) to trigger a crash."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted SMB NTLM messages to the target system."
