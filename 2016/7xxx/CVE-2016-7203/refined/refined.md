Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap overflow vulnerability exists within the Chakra JavaScript engine in Microsoft Edge, specifically during the `Array.splice` operation.
- The vulnerability occurs because an overflow check is performed before `ArraySpeciesCreate` is called. `ArraySpeciesCreate` can execute code and alter the array, leading to a heap overflow if the array has boundaries that cause integer overflows during the splice operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap overflow:** The core issue is a heap overflow when splicing an array with manipulated properties, caused by integer overflows during the operation.
- **Insufficient bounds checking:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks during the `Array.splice` operation, where array boundary manipulation is not properly handled, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
- **Control of the system:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website to exploit the vulnerability, then trick a user into visiting the site.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-generated content.
- **ActiveX Controls:** An attacker could embed a malicious ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or embed malicious code within a site visited by the victim.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into visiting the malicious site or opening a document with the embedded malicious code.
- No special user rights are needed, although administrative rights allow full system control after successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit code is slightly unreliable and might require refreshing to trigger the crash.
- This vulnerability is related to how Chakra handles array manipulation during the `splice` operation.
- The vulnerability was present in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.
- Microsoft rates this as a "Critical" vulnerability for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems
