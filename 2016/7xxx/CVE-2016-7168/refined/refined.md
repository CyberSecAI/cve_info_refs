Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file names during media uploads in WordPress. Specifically, the file name of an uploaded image is used as the image title (meta) within attachment pages (HTML).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core issue is a persistent XSS vulnerability. By crafting a malicious file name containing JavaScript code, an attacker can inject this code into the HTML of attachment pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that is executed within the context of a user's browser when they view the affected attachment page.
- This can lead to a wide range of malicious actions, such as:
  - Stealing session tokens and login credentials of WordPress administrators.
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
  - Defacing the website or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the WordPress Media Upload functionality. An attacker crafts an image file with a malicious file name containing JavaScript.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker must lure a WordPress administrator into uploading the malicious image. This often involves social engineering, where the admin might trust the source of the image or be tricked into uploading a seemingly benign file.
- **Attachment Pages:** The injected JavaScript payload is triggered when a user (including the admin or public visitor) views the attachment page containing the uploaded image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to convince a WordPress admin to upload a specially crafted image file.
- The attacker can then spread the URL to the attachment page of the uploaded malicious file to end users or the admin.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, the vulnerable code exists within attachment pages which are publicly accessible once the image is uploaded.
- The attack relies on a combination of technical exploit (malicious file name) and social engineering.
- The attacker needs some form of access to a system where they can craft the malicious file and distribute it to a target admin.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered because WordPress uses the uploaded file name directly as the image title on attachment pages.
- The file name is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML.
- The exploit depends on the extended filename capabilities of operating systems like macOS and Linux, allowing for characters that could be interpreted as HTML code.

**Mitigation:**

- This vulnerability was fixed in WordPress version 4.6.1 by sanitizing the file name before it's used in the image title.
- Users of older versions of WordPress are advised to update immediately.
