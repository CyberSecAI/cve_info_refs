{
  "CVE-2016-7427": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd's broadcast mode replay prevention functionality can be abused by injecting specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network, but the vulnerability exists if the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker.",
      "ntpd logs broadcast packets, which can be exploited."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Attacker needs access to the NTP broadcast domain.",
       "Attacker periodically injects specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast domain."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the NTP broadcast domain and the ability to spoof the source address of the broadcast server."
  }
}
