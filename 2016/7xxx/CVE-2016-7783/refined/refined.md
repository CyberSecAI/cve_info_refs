```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user-controlled input being directly used in an SQL query. Specifically, the $params variable in the line 118 of ./framework/core/models/expRecord.php is not sanitized and is directly used in an SQL query.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection (SQLi). The vulnerability allows for both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious SQL code through the "title" parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the "title" parameter. No prior authentication is explicitly mentioned as required for this vulnerability, which implies that this could be an unauthenticated vulnerability.
