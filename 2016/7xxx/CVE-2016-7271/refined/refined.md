The vulnerability stems from how Windows Secure Kernel Mode improperly handles objects in memory, which leads to a failure in correctly enforcing Virtual Trust Levels (VTLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory object handling in Secure Kernel Mode
- Failure to enforce Virtual Trust Levels (VTLs)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
- Violate Virtual Trust Levels (VTLs)
- Achieve elevation of privilege on the targeted system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A locally authenticated attacker needs to run a specially crafted application on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local authentication on the target system
- The attacker must be able to execute a custom application

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important"
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles objects in memory to properly enforce VTLs.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.
