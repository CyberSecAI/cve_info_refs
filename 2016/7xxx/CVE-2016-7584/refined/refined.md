The provided content contains information about CVE-2016-7584.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A validation issue existed in the handling of code signatures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is present in the AppleMobileFileIntegrity component. A signed executable may substitute code with the same team ID due to inadequate validation of code signatures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can substitute a signed executable with their own code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting a weakness in the code signature validation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the capability to create a malicious executable with the same team ID as a legitimate, signed executable. This would likely require some level of knowledge of the targeted application and its signing process.
