- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the logcheck function in `session.inc`. By providing a specific value as a user-agent, an attacker can bypass authentication to a number of pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to improper handling of user-agent values in the logcheck function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Remote attackers can bypass authentication.
    -  Access to view information.
    -  Modification of the application.
    -  Achieve arbitrary code execution as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific value as a user-agent in an HTTP request to the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable AlienVault Unified Security Management system. No prior authentication is needed.
