Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-7163:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `opj_pi_create_decode` function within the `pi.c` file of OpenJPEG library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `opj_pi_create_decode` function calculates a size value for memory allocation using multiplication. This calculation is vulnerable to an integer overflow if the input values are large enough, leading to a smaller-than-required memory allocation.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  Due to the insufficient memory allocation size from the integer overflow, later out-of-bounds read and write operations occur in the `opj_pi_next_cprl` function (and potentially other related functions). This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to the heap-based buffer overflow when processing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to application crashes and denial of service due to the memory corruption and out-of-bounds accesses.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote attackers:** By providing a specially crafted JPEG2000 (JP2) file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely when the file is processed by an application using the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
*   **File processing:** Vulnerable applications that load and process JPEG 2000 files are at risk

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide malformed JP2:** Attackers must be able to provide a malformed JP2 file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Serving the crafted JP2 file on a website.
    *   Sending the crafted file as an email attachment.
    *   Having the application process a locally stored crafted file.
*   **No authentication is required** to exploit this vulnerability.
*   No specific position required for the attacker.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
*   The fix involves an overflow check before the memory allocation.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in OpenJPEG versions 2.1.1 (fixed by commits c16bc05 and ef01f18), and 1.5.2.
*   Red Hat has released security advisories (RHSA-2017:0559 and RHSA-2017:0838) addressing this issue.
*   Debian also has released security advisory DSA 3665-1 addressing this issue.

**Summary**

CVE-2016-7163 is a critical vulnerability that stems from an integer overflow in the OpenJPEG library. By crafting a malformed JP2 file, an attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The vulnerability affects applications using the vulnerable versions of the OpenJPEG library, and can be triggered remotely without authentication.
