Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `avi_read_nikon` function in FFmpeg's AVI demuxer. This function is responsible for parsing specific Nikon-related data within AVI files. A crafted 'nctg' struct within the AVI file can trigger an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The core vulnerability is the potential for an infinite loop. The parsing logic within `avi_read_nikon` does not properly handle a malformed or crafted 'nctg' struct, causing the function to enter an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. When FFmpeg attempts to process a specially crafted AVI file, the infinite loop will consume system resources (CPU) and prevent FFmpeg from processing other tasks, effectively leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious AVI File:** The attack vector is a crafted AVI file that contains a specifically crafted 'nctg' struct. This file would be provided to FFmpeg as input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted AVI file to the FFmpeg application. This could be achieved via various means such as:
    *   Providing the file as input via a command line
    *   Providing the file to an application that leverages FFmpeg to handle media files.
    *   Attacker does not need to be local and remote exploitation is possible if application uses ffmpeg to handle files from untrusted sources.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is fixed in the commit `ed38046c5c2e3b310980be32287179895c83e0d8`.
-   The vulnerability was reported by 连一汉 (Lian Yihan) from Qihoo 360 Gear Team.
-   The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions prior to 3.1.4.
