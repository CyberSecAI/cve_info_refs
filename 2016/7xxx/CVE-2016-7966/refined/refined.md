Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7966:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in KMail's plain text viewer. Specifically, a malicious URL containing a quote character could be used to inject HTML code into the viewer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject HTML code into the plain text viewer, which is intended to display text without interpreting HTML markup. This breaks the expected behavior of the viewer.
*   **URL Parsing Issue:** The vulnerability is triggered by how the application parses URLs, specifically when a quote character is present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Breaking Plain Text Mode:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to break out of KMail's restricted plain text mode.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although the injected HTML is limited (cannot include the equals sign or space characters), this breakout could potentially be a stepping stone to exploiting other vulnerabilities in the HTML viewer (which is disabled by default), if further vulnerabilities exist.
*   **Malicious Content Display:** An attacker can send emails with malicious HTML content that will be rendered, bypassing the plain text restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** The primary attack vector is through sending a specially crafted email containing a malicious URL to a user using KMail.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to send malicious emails.
*   **Network:** The malicious email is likely sent over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to understand the specific vulnerability in KMail and craft a malicious URL that triggers the HTML injection.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The injected HTML is restricted; it cannot include equal signs (=) or spaces. This limits the malicious HTML that can be injected, although it is still possible to inject HTML comment indicators.
*   Patches are available for both KDE Frameworks-based releases (kcoreaddons) and kdelibs4-based releases (kdepimlibs) of KMail. Several commits were necessary for a complete fix.
*   The vulnerability affects KMail versions 4.4.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in multiple distributions.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in KMail allows for HTML injection via a crafted URL due to insufficient sanitization when displaying plain text. Although restricted in scope, this breaks out of the intended plain text mode and could be leveraged for further exploitation. Attackers can exploit this remotely by sending emails containing malicious URLs to KMail users.
