  /   [Security Alerts](/support/en_US/security.html)6. /  VTS16-002: NetBackup Appliance Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability

#### Revisions

Last updated October 17, 2016

1.0.2: Fixed a typo 'date' to 'data'.

1.0.1: Clarified that NetBackup and OpsCenter are not affected by this vulnerability.  Clarified versions for which EEBs are available.

#### Severity

| CVSS3 Base Score | Impact | Exploitability | CVSS3 Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthenicated User Can Execute Arbitrary Commands as Root | | | |
| 10.0 | 6.0 | 3.9 | [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C) |

#### Overview.

A vulnerability has been identified in Veritas (formerly Symantec) NetBackup Appliance.  Using this vulnerability an unauthenicated attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root resulting in privileged access to the targeted system.

#### Affected Products

| Product | Version | Solution(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Veritas NetBackup Appliance | 2.6.x, 2.7.x | Apply EEB released on October 4, 2016 for 2.6.0.4, 2.6.1.2 or 2.7.3 as appropriate.  If using an earlier version than listed above, e.g. 2.6.0.3 or 2.7.2, you must upgrade to the latest version on the branch before applying the EEB. |

Note: Neither NetBackup nor OpsCenter are affected by this vulnerability

#### **Details**

Veritas (formerly Symantec) was notified of a single security issue impacting NetBackup Appliance.

CVE-2016-7399: An unauthenticated attacker, with working knowledge of the NetBackup Appliance implementation, can execute arbitrary commands as root.  The attacker could use executables already present on the appliance to copy new, malicious executables to the system potentially resulting in total compromise of the appliance and all data on it.

#### **Veritas Response**

Veritas engineers verified this issue and resolved it in Veritas NetBackup Appliance hotfixes (EEBs) to recent releases as identified in the affected products matrix above.  Customers should upgrade and apply available hotfixes to avoid potential incidents of this nature.  See the [TechNote](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000116055) for our how to obtain the EEBs.

Veritas is not aware of exploitation of or adverse customer impact from these issues.

#### **Best Practices**

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities

#### **Credit**

Veritas would like to thank Matthew Hall with [SEC-1](http://www.sec-1.com/) for reporting this issue and coordinating with us as we resolved it.

#### **References**

**CVE:** This issue is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list ([http://cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)), which standardizes names for security problems.
