Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7216:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the Windows Kernel API enforces permissions. Specifically, it appears that access controls applied to sensitive information were not being correctly enforced by the kernel API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the Windows kernel API does not properly restrict access to sensitive information, which could lead to unauthorized data disclosure.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information that is not intended to be available to the user.
- **Potential Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability description indicates that the attacker could use the information gained to potentially elevate privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Exploitation:** An attacker needs to be locally authenticated on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a local account on the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to run an arbitrary application on the system.

**Additional details from exploit-db.com content:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered while loading corrupted registry hive files via `nt!RtlEqualSid` function.
- The vulnerability results in an out-of-bounds read and system crash.
- A program needs to call `RegLoadAppKey()` API to load the malicious registry file.
- The issue reproduces on Windows 7, but it is also possible to observe a crash on default Windows installations.

In summary, CVE-2016-7216 is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability caused by improper access control in the Windows Kernel API that can be exploited using a specially crafted application. The exploit allows for unauthorized information disclosure and potentially further privilege escalation.
