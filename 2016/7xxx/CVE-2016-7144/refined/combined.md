by **[Syzop](./memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=9&sid=95d9f9424689b2187037daed6f8cd5fc)** » Sat Sep 03, 2016 7:05 pm

A security issue was detected in a number of IRCd's, including UnrealIRCd, regarding the way SASL is implemented.

If you use services and have SASL enabled (you need to do this explicitly) then you should patch or upgrade as soon as possible.

While this only affects 2% of our userbase, for those networks which are affected this is a very serious issue. If you are affected you can upgrade to one of the new UnrealIRCd releases or you can upgrade their existing UnrealIRCd without a restart (see below)

UPDATE: You can use our [online security check](https://www.unrealircd.org/check_sasl.php) to see if your server is vulnerable or not!

Note that releases and this security announcement have been made in a hurry. Details on this issue are already available online at other websites.

Issue details

An attacker can send an SSL fingerprint of his choice to services when doing SASL authentication. An attacker can compromise a services account if the user has an SSL fingerprint stored in services.

How to check if you are affected (how do I know if I use SASL?)

You are only affected if ALL of the following 3 conditions are true:

* SASL is enabled in UnrealIRCd: check if set::sasl-server is set to a valid server
* Your services support SASL (eg: anope)
* Your services support SSL fingerprint authentication (eg: anope)

How to get the fix/patch?

Windows users should download and install UnrealIRCd 4.0.6 or 3.2.10.7.

Linux/BSD/.. users can also install 4.0.6 / 3.2.10.7 OR you can choose to patch UnrealIRCd on-the-fly without a restart.

Since the patch is usually the easiest and most user friendly solution, we recommend it.

Run the following on the IRC shell:

Code: Select all

```
wget http://www.unrealircd.org/patch/saslpatcher && sh saslpatcher
```

Q&A

**Have there been any reports of these bugs being abused by anyone?**

We don't know. It sounds likely, the issue is very easy to exploit.

**Should I upgrade?**

If you use SASL authentication then yes you should definitely upgrade. If you do not have SASL enabled then there is no need to upgrade at this time, this is true for most of our users (98%).

**Are there any workarounds so I don't have to upgrade?**

As a very quick workaround you could disable SASL entirely by removing the set::sasl-server setting and rehashing the IRCd.

You could also disable SASL at the services level. For anope you do this by unloading the m\_sasl module (in anope).

**Can I upgrade without restarting the IRC server?**

On Windows no, but on Linux/BSD/.. yes you can. Run the following on the shell:

Code: Select all

```
wget http://www.unrealircd.org/patch/saslpatcher && sh saslpatcher
```

**How serious are these bugs?**

See the Issue details above. If you are affected then all user accounts with an SSL fingerprint for authentication can be compromised.

**I don't trust the patch script. Where can I download a .patch or unidiff?**

[https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealirc ... 4a766.diff](https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd/commit/f473e355e1dc422c4f019dbf86bc50ba1a34a766.diff)

**When was this issue reported?**

We received an email regarding this issue, but by the time it was read (90 minutes later) details were already published online. This UnrealIRCd release, patch and security announcement were thus made in a hurry and were sent out 2 hours later.

Subject: CVE ID request: certificate spoofing through crafted SASL message in inspircd, charybdis

inspircd published 2.0.23 that fixes an issue with SASL
authentication. The details are here:

<http://www.inspircd.org/2016/09/03/v2023-released.html>

All versions are affected.

Upstream hasn't requested a CVE yet. I told them I would request one
from here on IRC.

It seems to also affect Charybdis, which fixed the issue in the
upcoming 3.5.3 release:

<https://github.com/charybdis-ircd/charybdis/commit/818a3fda944b26d4814132cee14cfda4ea4aa824>

Subject: Re: CVE ID request: certificate spoofing through crafted SASL message in inspircd, charybdis

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> inspircd published 2.0.23 that fixes an issue with SASL
> authentication. The details are here:
>
> <http://www.inspircd.org/2016/09/03/v2023-released.html>
>
> All versions are affected.

>> This release fixes a serious security vulnerability in m_sasl in
>> combination with any services that support SASL EXTERNAL. To be
>> vulnerable you must have m_sasl loaded, and have services which
>> support SASL EXTERNAL authentication.
>>
>> This vulnerability allows any attacker to spoof certificate
>> fingerprints via crafted SASL messages to the IRCd. This allows any
>> user to login as any other user that they know the certificate
>> fingerprint of, and that user has services configured to accept SASL
>> EXTERNAL login requests for.

>> <https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/74fafb7f11b06747f69f182ad5e3769b665eea7a>

>> <https://www.irc.wiki/InspIRCd>

>> InspIRCd is an IRC daemon written entirely from scratch, it is one
>> of the few IRC daemons to be written in C++

Use CVE-2016-7142 for this issue only in the InspIRCd codebase.

>> This bug appears more widespread than just InspIRCd, and seems to
>> affect most or all other implementations of SASL EXTERNAL, including
>> Charybdis and UnrealIRCd.

> It seems to also affect Charybdis, which fixed the issue in the
> upcoming 3.5.3 release:
>
> <https://github.com/charybdis-ircd/charybdis/commit/818a3fda944b26d4814132cee14cfda4ea4aa824>

Use CVE-2016-7143 for this issue only in the Charybdis codebase.

>> <https://forums.unrealircd.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8588>
>>
>> Security: SASL security issue (UnrealIRCd 4.0.6 & 3.2.10.7 released)
>>
>> A security issue was detected in a number of IRCd's, including
>> UnrealIRCd, regarding the way SASL is implemented.
>>
>> An attacker can send an SSL fingerprint of his choice to services when
>> doing SASL authentication. An attacker can compromise a services
>> account if the user has an SSL fingerprint stored in services.
>>
>> <https://github.com/unrealircd/unrealircd/commit/f473e355e1dc422c4f019dbf86bc50ba1a34a766>

Use CVE-2016-7144 for this issue only in the UnrealIRCd codebase.

(We realize that the file is m_sasl.c, the function is m_authenticate,
and the array is parv in both the Charybdis case and the UnrealIRCd
case, but we decided not to try to share a CVE ID between these two
products.)
