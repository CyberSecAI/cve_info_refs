Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7408:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `dbclient` could execute arbitrary code due to specific `-m` or `-c` arguments being provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper handling of arguments passed to the `dbclient` program, specifically with `-m` or `-c` flags. This allows the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `dbclient`. This means if `dbclient` is run with elevated privileges (e.g. by a script), the attacker may gain those privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the command line arguments passed to `dbclient`. This vulnerability can be exploited if `dbclient` is used in scripts or other automation processes where an attacker can influence the arguments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `-m` or `-c` arguments passed to the `dbclient` application. This might involve manipulating scripts that use the vulnerable `dbclient`, or passing arguments through a web page or other means.
*   The attacker needs to have some mechanism to execute the vulnerable `dbclient` with the crafted parameters.
*   Local access to run the `dbclient` program is required.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "Security" issue.
*   The fix is included in `dropbear` version 2016.74.
*   The `oss-security` mailing list and gentoo security advisory confirm that this is a command injection vulnerability in `dbclient` via the `-m` and `-c` options.
*   The issue has been assigned CVE-2016-7408.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and considered a high priority and severity issue.
