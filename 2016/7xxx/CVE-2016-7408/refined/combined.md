> CVEs?

We don't feel that it's a case of independent mistakes in the client
and server. The type of exposure is not, by itself, relevant to the
number of CVEs.

> - Security: Message printout was vulnerable to format string injection.
>
>   If specific usernames including "%" symbols can be created on a system
>   (validated by getpwnam()) then an attacker could run arbitrary code as root
>   when connecting to Dropbear server.
>
>   A dbclient user who can control username or host arguments could potentially
>   run arbitrary code as the dbclient user. This could be a problem if scripts
>   or webpages pass untrusted input to the dbclient program.
>   <https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/b66a483f3dcb>

Use CVE-2016-7406 for all of this.

> - Security: dropbearconvert import of OpenSSH keys could run arbitrary code as
>   the local dropbearconvert user when parsing malicious key files
>   <https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/34e6127ef02e>

Use CVE-2016-7407. (Admittedly, we do not completely understand
whether this is identical to a code problem previously found in
PuTTY.)

> - Security: dbclient could run arbitrary code as the local dbclient user if
>   particular -m or -c arguments are provided. This could be an issue where
>   dbclient is used in scripts.
>   <https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/eed9376a4ad6>

Use CVE-2016-7408.

> - Security: dbclient or dropbear server could expose process memory to the
>   running user if compiled with DEBUG_TRACE and running with -v
>   <https://secure.ucc.asn.au/hg/dropbear/rev/6a14b1f6dc04>

Use CVE-2016-7409.

# Dropbear: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-23**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Dropbear, the worst of
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/dropbear** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2016.74** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2016.74** |

### Background

Dropbear is an SSH server and client designed with a small memory
footprint.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dropbear. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with root
privileges if usernames containing special characters can be created on a
system. Also, a dbclient user who can control username or host arguments
could potentially run arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

In addition, a remote attacker could entice a user to process a
specially crafted SSH key using dropbearconvert, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dropbear users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dropbear-2016.74"

```
