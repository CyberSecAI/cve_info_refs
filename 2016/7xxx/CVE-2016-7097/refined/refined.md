{
  "CVE-2016-7097": {
    "description": "The filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel filesystem implementation does not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The setgid bit is preserved instead of being cleared when setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr, which allows bypassing the check in chmod(2)."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can gain group privileges by leveraging a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.",
    "attack_vector": "Local attacker using setxattr.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to use setxattr to modify file permissions."
