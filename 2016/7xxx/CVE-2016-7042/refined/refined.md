  "CVE-2016-7042": {
    "description": "It was found that when gcc stack protector is turned on, proc_keys_show() can cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to the stack corruption. This happens because xbuf[] is not big enough to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient buffer size to hold a 64-bit timeout value in proc_keys_show().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack corruption"

    "impact": "Local users can cause a kernel panic due to stack corruption. In some cases, this may lead to local privilege escalation.",

      "Local exploitation by reading the /proc/keys file."
