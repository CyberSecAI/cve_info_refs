Use CVE-2016-7798 for this issue in the openssl gem for Ruby. (Note
that <https://github.com/ruby/openssl/blob/master/History.md> describes
this as "openssl gem, formerly a standard library of Ruby,
ext/openssl.") The same CVE ID applies to the effects of this
vulnerability on the encryptor gem and the attr_encrypted gem.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Possible bug: order of setting key vs. IV affects encryption with AES GCM #49

## Description

[![@borama](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/462701?v=4&size=48)](/borama)[borama](https://github.com/borama)opened [on Mar 27, 2016](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/49#issue-143818021)

Hello, I think I may have found a possible bug in the ruby openssl code for encryption.

If initialization vector is set *before* setting the encryption key when using one of the `AES-*-GCM` algorithms, the encryption does not take the IV into account at all and two different IVs (with the same key) produce the same encrypted ciphertext. If IV is set *after* the key, everything behaves perfectly OK. This issue does not affect other algorithms, only the AES-GCM ones.

*For more context about how I came to this conclusion, please see [this stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36118231/1544012) and [this pull request](https://github.com/attr-encrypted/encryptor/pull/22) in the `encryptor` gem.*

Let me first show a simple test in ruby, to prove this issue:

```
# test_gcm.rb
require 'openssl'

def hex_enc(bytes)
  bytes.bytes.map { |b| sprintf("%02x", b) }.join(" ")
end

def test_aes_encr(n, cipher, data, key, iv, iv_before_key = true)
  cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new(cipher)
  cipher.encrypt

  if iv_before_key
    cipher.iv = iv
    cipher.key = key
  else
    cipher.key = key
    cipher.iv = iv
  end

  if cipher.name.downcase.end_with?("gcm")
    cipher.auth_data = ""
  end

  result = cipher.update(data)
  result << cipher.final

  puts "#{n} #{cipher.name}, iv #{iv_before_key ? "BEFORE" : "AFTER "} key: " +
           "iv=#{iv}, result=#{hex_enc(result)}"
end

data = "something private"
key = "This is a key that is 256 bits!!"

# control tests using AES-256-CBC
test_aes_encr(1, "aes-256-cbc", data, key, "aaaabbbbccccdddd", true)
test_aes_encr(2, "aes-256-cbc", data, key, "eeeeffffgggghhhh", true)
test_aes_encr(3, "aes-256-cbc", data, key, "aaaabbbbccccdddd", false)
test_aes_encr(4, "aes-256-cbc", data, key, "eeeeffffgggghhhh", false)

# failing tests using AES-256-GCM
test_aes_encr(5, "aes-256-gcm", data, key, "aaaabbbbcccc", true)
test_aes_encr(6, "aes-256-gcm", data, key, "eeeeffffgggg", true)
test_aes_encr(7, "aes-256-gcm", data, key, "aaaabbbbcccc", false)
test_aes_encr(8, "aes-256-gcm", data, key, "eeeeffffgggg", false)
```

When you run this test file, you'll get these results:

```
1 AES-256-CBC, iv BEFORE key: iv=aaaabbbbccccdddd, result=e0 80 06 71 ac d1 98 45 08 44 31 37 66 91 20 a1 2d 0d 9a 6d 7f fa 7a dd e5 54 f6 fd 76 9b d1 63

```

The critical lines are lines 5 and 6. They show that when the IV is set before the encryption key, the IV is not taken into account. Lines 1-4 show that it this behavior is not present in the CBC encryption mode.

I tried to do further tests and they suggest that this behavior is caused by the **pre-initialization of the encryption key** in [`ossl_cipher.c`](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/blob/master/ext/openssl/ossl_cipher.c#L130). In the following test, I tried to closely mimic the C calls that ruby-openssl makes when doing a very simple encryption task:

    aes_gcm_encrypt(true, false);
    aes_gcm_encrypt(false, true);
    aes_gcm_encrypt(false, false);
 }
```

The test tries to encrypt the same data as in the ruby test above, with IV set before / after the key and with or without the pre-initialization of the key. Compiling and running the test reveals the following:

```
init key, iv before key:
0000 - 4e 5f c7 7e 45 a9 c2 80-72 79 84 73 e8 cc f8 c8   N_.~E...ry.s....
0010 - 8a                                                .
no init key, iv before key:
0000 - fb 82 32 9f b4 52 0c a8-a6 4d 08 b4 4b 78 27 e7   ..2..R...M..Kx'.
0010 - c1                                                .
init key, iv after  key:
0000 - fb 82 32 9f b4 52 0c a8-a6 4d 08 b4 4b 78 27 e7   ..2..R...M..Kx'.
0010 - c1                                                .
no init key, iv after  key:
0000 - fb 82 32 9f b4 52 0c a8-a6 4d 08 b4 4b 78 27 e7   ..2..R...M..Kx'.
0010 - c1

```

The test shows that when the key pre-initialization (i.e. setting the key to all zeroes when configuring the cipher) is skipped, the IV, even if set before the encryption key, is correctly taken into account. On the other hand, when the pre-initialization takes place, the IV must be set after the key for the data to be encrypted correctly. I have not experienced any seg-faults when not preinitializing the key (a warning about this is present in the comment above the preinitialization code). I compiled and tested the code above against [master branch of openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) as well as `openssl-1.0.1f` with the same results.

Overall, this behavior seems to me like a bug. Nowhere in the ruby-openssl documentation I have found any mention about the **order of setting IV vs key being relevant for the encryption process**. I believe this should perhaps be more explicitly documented, because accidental setting IVs before keys with GCM algorithms would lead to **a severe weakening of the whole encryption**, without the user being warned in any way.

What do you think? Let me know if you need further info and thanks!

Subject: CVE Request - Ruby OpenSSL Library - IV Reuse in GCM Mode

Product: Ruby's OpenSSL Library
Version: Tested on 2.3.1 (latest)
Bug: IV Reuse
Impact: Depends on the usage of the library

Hello,

An IV reuse bug was discovered in Ruby's OpenSSL library when using
aes-gcm. When encrypting data with aes-*-gcm, if the IV is set before
setting the key, the cipher will default to using a static IV. This creates
a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known
cryptographic issues.

The documentation does not appear to specify the order of operations when
setting the key and IV [1]. As an example, see the following insecure code
snippet below:

Vulnerable Code:

def encrypt(plaintext)
    cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('aes-256-gcm')
    iv = cipher.random_iv # Notice here the IV is set before the key
    cipher.key = '11111111111111111111111111111111'
    cipher.auth_data = ""
    ciphertext = cipher.update(plaintext) + cipher.final
    tag = cipher.auth_tag

    puts "[+] Encrypting: #{plaintext}"
    puts "[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): #{bin2hex(iv)} |
#{bin2hex(tag)} | #{bin2hex(ciphertext)}"
end

A developer that uses the code above may incorrectly assume that their code
is secure from the pitfalls associated with IV reuse in aes-*-gcm, since
the ‘cipher.random_iv’ method is used. According to the documentation, this
should generate a random IV each time the encryption method is called.

When the code above is run with the same key and same plaintext message,
the following results are obtained:

Output:
# Run 1
./gcm_encrypt.rb 'This is some secret message.'
[+] Encrypting: This is some secret message.
[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): e32594080cca2b37f7d7e968 |
8c676db7551cf046266252ee776ecaa9 | 81092d16b62902d9985656253891dc
800a5bb48fb1c4ad0b7bdf6054

# Run 2
./gcm_encrypt.rb 'This is some secret message.'
[+] Encrypting: This is some secret message.
[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): 431d70714f5e5f876d1c7830 |
8c676db7551cf046266252ee776ecaa9 | 81092d16b62902d9985656253891dc
800a5bb48fb1c4ad0b7bdf6054

Notice that in the output above a unique IV is returned for both runs, but
with the same ciphertext. This proves that even though the random_iv method
is called, the code is defaulting to a static IV. If an attacker can
retrieve multiple ciphertext messages, it is possible to decrypt the
ciphertexts by applying the same attack one would use in a two-time pad
(XOR ciphertexts and crib drag).

Next review the following code snippet and output, which depicts a secure
implementation of the code:

Valid Code:

def encrypt(plaintext)
    cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('aes-256-gcm')
    cipher.key = '11111111111111111111111111111111'
    iv = cipher.random_iv # Notice here the IV is set after the key
    cipher.auth_data = ""
    ciphertext = cipher.update(plaintext) + cipher.final
    tag = cipher.auth_tag

    puts "[+] Encrypting: #{plaintext}"
    puts "[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): #{bin2hex(iv)} |
#{bin2hex(tag)} | #{bin2hex(ciphertext)}"
end

Output:
# Run 1
./gcm_encrypt.rb 'This is some secret message.'
[+] Encrypting: This is some secret message.
[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): 8beb4aa05533e90f4f4eddd3 |
ea1b015958a9b8bd2aafa61887309caf | 19574a9c9869b92140a57a5fd43a14
9a5eaa7e5beefdff5d56cc4136

# Run 2
./gcm_encrypt.rb 'This is some secret message.'
[+] Encrypting: This is some secret message.
[+] CipherMessage (IV | Tag | Ciphertext): 87361b3f1e32291602ac7b40 |
bce7093daa10cc9d2fad0f2b91e077f2 | 47f9a5ba55631204233ace70f169e6
65846e877dca11a6e13a659540

Notice that this time both the IV and ciphertexts are both different for
the same plaintext. This is the intended result a developer would expect to
happen when using this library.

It should be noted that when I went to Ruby's github page to report this
bug, I noticed a developer also independently encountered this weird
phenomenon [2]. Since it has already been brought up to the Ruby team, I
have not created a new ticket.

I'd like to to request a CVE ID for this issue.

    deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which
    processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification
    can lead to remote code execution.

CVE-2017-10784

    Yusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability in
    the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the WEBrick log and
    potentially execute control characters on the victim's terminal
    emulator when reading logs.

CVE-2017-14033

    asac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    extension. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to
    cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2017-14064

    Heap memory disclosure in the JSON library.

CVE-2017-17405

    A command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP might allow a
    malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary commands.

CVE-2017-17742

    Aaron Patterson reported that WEBrick bundled with Ruby was vulnerable
    to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. It was possible for an
    attacker to inject fake HTTP responses if a script accepted an
    external input and output it without modifications.

CVE-2017-17790

    A command injection vulnerability in lib/resolv.rb's lazy_initialze
    might allow a command injection attack. However untrusted input to
    this function is rather unlikely.

CVE-2018-6914

    ooooooo_q discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the
    Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library. It made it possible for
    attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a .. (dot dot)
    in the prefix argument.

CVE-2018-8777

    Eric Wong reported an out-of-memory DoS vulnerability related to a
    large request in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.

CVE-2018-8778

    aerodudrizzt found a buffer under-read vulnerability in the Ruby
    String#unpack method. If a big number was passed with the specifier @,
    the number was treated as a negative value, and an out-of-buffer read
    occurred. Attackers could read data on heaps if an script accepts an
    external input as the argument of String#unpack.

CVE-2018-8779

    ooooooo_q reported that the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open
    methods of the socket library bundled with Ruby did not check for NUL
    bytes in the path argument. The lack of check made the methods
    vulnerable to unintentional socket creation and unintentional socket
    access.

CVE-2018-8780

    ooooooo_q discovered an unintentional directory traversal in
    some methods in Dir, by the lack of checking for NUL bytes in their
    parameter.

CVE-2018-1000075

    A negative size vulnerability in ruby gem package tar header that could
    cause an infinite loop.

CVE-2018-1000076

    RubyGems package improperly verifies cryptographic signatures. A mis-signed
    gem could be installed if the tarball contains multiple gem signatures.

CVE-2018-1000077

    An improper input validation vulnerability in RubyGems specification
    homepage attribute could allow malicious gem to set an invalid homepage
    URL.

CVE-2018-1000078

    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage
    attribute.

CVE-2018-1000079

    Path Traversal vulnerability during gem installation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.5-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.1 packages.

cipher: don't set dummy encryption key in Cipher#initialize

```
Remove the encryption key initialization from Cipher#initialize. This
is effectively a revert of r32723 ("Avoid possible SEGV from AES
encryption/decryption", 2011-07-28).

r32723, which added the key initialization, was a workaround for
Ruby Bug #2768. For some certain ciphers, calling EVP_CipherUpdate()
before setting an encryption key caused segfault. It was not a problem
until OpenSSL implemented GCM mode - the encryption key could be
overridden by repeated calls of EVP_CipherInit_ex(). But, it is not the
case for AES-GCM ciphers. Setting a key, an IV, a key, in this order
causes the IV to be reset to an all-zero IV.

The problem of Bug #2768 persists on the current versions of OpenSSL.
So, make Cipher#update raise an exception if a key is not yet set by the
user. Since encrypting or decrypting without key does not make any
sense, this should not break existing applications.

Users can still call Cipher#key= and Cipher#iv= multiple times with
their own responsibility.

# Version 3.3.0

## Compatibility

* Ruby version: 2.7 or later
* OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, and LibreSSL 3.1 or later

## Notable changes

* `OpenSSL::SSL`
  + `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#set_params` no longer sets `#min_version=` to TLS
    1.0 except when OpenSSL 1.0.2 is used. This has been done to disable
    SSL 3.0, which is not supported by default in OpenSSL 1.1.0 or later, or in
    LibreSSL. This lets it respect the system default if the system-wide
    configuration file specifies a higher minimum protocol version.
    [[GitHub #710]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/710)
  + `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new` no longer enables the `OpenSSL::SSL::OP_ALL`
    SSL options by default and follows the system default.
    [[GitHub #767]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/767)
  + Add the following IO methods to `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket`, which will pass
    along to the underlying socket: `#local_address`, `#remote_address`,
    `#close_on_exec=`, `#close_on_exec?`, `#wait`, `#wait_readable`, and
    `#wait_writable`.
    [[GitHub #708]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/708)
  + Update `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#gets` to take the `chomp` keyword argument.
    [[GitHub #708]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/708)
  + Make `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket` respect the `IO#timeout` value of the
    underlying socket on Ruby 3.2 or later. `#timeout` and `#timeout=` methods
    are also added.
    [[GitHub #714]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/714)
  + Add `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#close_read` and `#close_write`.
    [[GitHub #743]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/743)
  + Add `OpenSSL::Digest.digests` to get a list of all available digest
    algorithms.
    [[GitHub #726]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/726)
  + Fix `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#read_nonblock` clearing the passed String
    buffer when nothing can be read from the connection.
    [[GitHub #739]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/739)
* Add `#to_text` methods to `OpenSSL::Timestamp::Response`,
  `OpenSSL::Timestamp::Request`, `OpenSSL::Timestamp::TokenInfo`, and
  `OpenSSL::PKCS7` to get a human-readable representation of the object.
  [[GitHub #756]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/756)
* Add `OpenSSL::X509::Certificate#tbs_bytes` to get the DER encoding of the
  TBSCertificate.
  [[GitHub #753]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/753)
* Allow passing `nil` as the digest algorithm to `#sign` methods on
  `OpenSSL::X509::Certificate`, `OpenSSL::X509::Request`, and

  [[GitHub #541]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/541)

# Version 3.0.0

## Compatibility notes

* OpenSSL 1.0.1 and Ruby 2.3-2.5 are no longer supported.
  [[GitHub #396]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/396)
  [[GitHub #466]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/466)
* OpenSSL 3.0 support is added. It is the first major version bump from OpenSSL
  1.1 and contains incompatible changes that affect Ruby/OpenSSL.
  Note that OpenSSL 3.0 support is preliminary and not all features are
  currently available:
  [[GitHub #369]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/369)

  + Deprecate the ability to modify `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey` instances. OpenSSL 3.0
    made EVP\_PKEY structure immutable, and hence the following methods are not
    available when Ruby/OpenSSL is linked against OpenSSL 3.0.
    [[GitHub #480]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/480)

    - `OpenSSL::PKey::RSA#set_key`, `#set_factors`, `#set_crt_params`
    - `OpenSSL::PKey::DSA#set_pqg`, `#set_key`
    - `OpenSSL::PKey::DH#set_pqg`, `#set_key`, `#generate_key!`
    - `OpenSSL::PKey::EC#private_key=`, `#public_key=`, `#group=`, `#generate_key!`
  + Deprecate `OpenSSL::Engine`. The ENGINE API has been deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0
    in favor of the new "provider" concept and will be removed in a future
    version.
    [[GitHub #481]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/481)
* `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#tmp_ecdh_callback` has been removed. It has been
  deprecated since v2.0.0 because it is incompatible with modern OpenSSL
  versions.
  [[GitHub #394]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/394)
* `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#read` and `#write` now raise `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError`
  if called before a TLS connection is established. Historically, they
  read/wrote unencrypted data to the underlying socket directly in that case.
  [[GitHub #9]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/9)
  [[GitHub #469]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/469)

## Notable changes

* Enhance OpenSSL::PKey's common interface.
  [[GitHub #370]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/370)

  + Key deserialization: Enhance `OpenSSL::PKey.read` to handle PEM encoding of
    DH parameters, which used to be only deserialized by `OpenSSL::PKey::DH.new`.
    [[GitHub #328]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/328)
  + Key generation: Add `OpenSSL::PKey.generate_parameters` and
    `OpenSSL::PKey.generate_key`.
    [[GitHub #329]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/329)
  + Public key signing: Enhance `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#sign` and `#verify` to use
    the new EVP\_DigestSign() family to enable PureEdDSA support on OpenSSL 1.1.1
    or later. They also now take optional algorithm-specific parameters for more
    control.
    [[GitHub #329]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/329)
  + Low-level public key signing and verification: Add
    `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#sign_raw`, `#verify_raw`, and `#verify_recover`.
    [[GitHub #382]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/382)
  + Public key encryption: Add `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#encrypt` and `#decrypt`.
    [[GitHub #382]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/382)
  + Key agreement: Add `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#derive`.
    [[GitHub #329]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/329)
  + Key comparison: Add `OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#compare?` to conveniently check
    that two keys have common parameters and a public key.
    [[GitHub #383]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/383)
* Add `OpenSSL::BN#set_flags` and `#get_flags`. This can be used in combination
  with `OpenSSL::BN::CONSTTIME` to force constant-time computation.
  [[GitHub #417]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/417)
* Add `OpenSSL::BN#abs` to get the absolute value of the BIGNUM.
  [[GitHub #430]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/430)
* Add `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#getbyte`.
  [[GitHub #438]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/438)
* Add `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#tmp_dh=`.
  [[GitHub #459]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/459)
* Add `OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.load` to load a PEM-encoded and concatenated
  list of X.509 certificates at once.
  [[GitHub #441]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/441)
* Change `OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new` to attempt to deserialize the given
  string first as DER encoding first and then as PEM encoding to ensure the
  round-trip consistency.
  [[GitHub #442]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/442)
* Update various part of the code base to use the modern API. No breaking
  changes are intended with this. This includes:

  + `OpenSSL::HMAC` uses the EVP API.
    [[GitHub #371]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/371)
  + `OpenSSL::Config` uses native OpenSSL API to parse config files.
    [[GitHub #342]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/issues/342)

# Version 2.0.0

This is the first release of openssl gem, formerly a standard library of Ruby,
ext/openssl. This is the successor of the version included in Ruby 2.3.

## Compatibility notes

* Support for OpenSSL version 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 is completely removed. openssl gem
  still works with OpenSSL 0.9.8, but users are strongly encouraged to upgrade
  to at least 1.0.1, as OpenSSL < 1.0.1 will not receive any security fixes from
  the OpenSSL development team.

## Supported platforms

* OpenSSL 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1.0
* OpenSSL < 0.9.8 is no longer supported.
* LibreSSL 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
* Ruby 2.3, 2.4

## Notable changes

* Add support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.
  [[Feature #12324]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12324)
* Add support for LibreSSL
* OpenSSL::Cipher

  + OpenSSL::Cipher#key= and #iv= reject too long inputs. They used to truncate
    silently. [[Bug #12561]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12561)
  + OpenSSL::Cipher#iv\_len= is added. It allows changing IV (nonce) length if
    using AEAD ciphers.
    [[Bug #8667]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8667),
    [[Bug #10420]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10420),
    [[GH ruby/ruby#569]](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/569),
    [[GH ruby/openssl#58]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/58)
  + OpenSSL::Cipher#auth\_tag\_len= is added. This sets the authentication tag
    length to be generated by an AEAD cipher.
* OpenSSL::OCSP

  + Accessor methods are added to OpenSSL::OCSP::CertificateId.
    [[Feature #7181]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7181)
  + OpenSSL::OCSP::Request and BasicResponse can be signed with non-SHA-1 hash
    algorithm. [[Feature #11552]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11552)
  + OpenSSL::OCSP::CertificateId and BasicResponse can be encoded into DER.
  + A new class OpenSSL::OCSP::SingleResponse is added for convenience.
  + OpenSSL::OCSP::BasicResponse#add\_status accepts absolute times. They used to
    accept only relative seconds from the current time.
* OpenSSL::PKey

  + OpenSSL::PKey::EC follows the general PKey interface.
    [[Bug #6567]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6567)
  + OpenSSL::PKey.read raises OpenSSL::PKey::PKeyError instead of ArgumentError
    for consistency with OpenSSL::PKey::{DH,DSA,RSA,EC}#new.
    [[Bug #11774]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11774),
    [[GH ruby/openssl#55]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/55)
  + OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Group retrieved by OpenSSL::PKey::EC#group is no longer
    linked with the EC key. Modifications to the EC::Group have no effect on the
    key. [[GH ruby/openssl#71]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/71)
  + OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point#to\_bn allows specifying the point conversion form
    by the optional argument.
* OpenSSL::SSL

  + OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket#tmp\_key is added. A client can call it after the
    connection is established to retrieve the ephemeral key.
    [[GH ruby/ruby#1318]](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/1318)
  + The automatic ephemeral ECDH curve selection is enabled by default when
    built with OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 or LibreSSL.
  + OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#security\_level= is added. You can set the "security
    level" of the SSL context. This is effective only when built with OpenSSL
    1.1.0.
  + A new option 'verify\_hostname' is added to OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext. When it
    is enabled, and the SNI hostname is also set, the hostname verification on
    the server certificate is automatically performed. It is now enabled by
    OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set\_params.
    [[GH ruby/openssl#60]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/60)

## Removals

* OpenSSL::Engine

  + OpenSSL::Engine.cleanup does nothing when built with OpenSSL 1.1.0.
* OpenSSL::SSL

  + OpenSSL::PKey::DH::DEFAULT\_512 is removed. Hence servers no longer use
    512-bit DH group by default. It is considered too weak nowadays.
    [[Bug #11968]](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11968),
    [[GH ruby/ruby#1196]](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/1196)
  + RC4 cipher suites are removed from OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext::DEFAULT\_PARAMS.
    RC4 is now considered to be weak.
    [[GH ruby/openssl#50]](https://github.com/ruby/openssl/pull/50)

## Deprecations

* OpenSSL::PKey

  + OpenSSL::PKey::RSA#n=, #e=, #d=, #p=, #q=, #dmp1=, #dmq1=, #iqmp=,
    OpenSSL::PKey::DSA#p=, #q=, #g=, #priv\_key=, #pub\_key=,
    OpenSSL::PKey::DH#p=, #g=, #priv\_key= and #pub\_key= are deprecated. They are
    disabled when built with OpenSSL 1.1.0, due to its API change. Instead,
    OpenSSL::PKey::RSA#set\_key, #set\_factors, #set\_crt\_params,
    OpenSSL::PKey::DSA#set\_pqg, #set\_key, OpenSSL::PKey::DH#set\_pqg and #set\_key
    are added.
* OpenSSL::Random

  + OpenSSL::Random.pseudo\_bytes is deprecated, and not defined when built with
    OpenSSL 1.1.0. Use OpenSSL::Random.random\_bytes instead.
* OpenSSL::SSL

  + OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#tmp\_ecdh\_callback is deprecated, as the underlying
    API SSL\_CTX\_set\_tmp\_ecdh\_callback() is removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0. It was
    first added in Ruby 2.3.0. To specify the curve to be used in ephemeral
    ECDH, use OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#ecdh\_curves=. The automatic curve
    selection is also now enabled by default when built with a capable OpenSSL.
