```
Security Advisory           @ Mediaservice.net Srl
(#05, 23/11/2016)           Data Security Division

         Title:	Red Hat JBoss EAP deserialization of untrusted data
   Application:	JBoss EAP 5.2.X and prior versions
   Description:	The application server deserializes untrusted data via the
                JMX Invoker Servlet. This can lead to a DoS via resource
                exhaustion and potentially remote code execution.
        Author: Federico Dotta <federico.dotta@mediaservice.net>
                Maurizio Agazzini <inode@mediaservice.net>
 Vendor Status: Will not fix
 CVE Candidate: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
                the name CVE-2016-7065 to this issue.
    References: http://lab.mediaservice.net/advisory/2016-05-jboss.txt
                http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/jboss_payload.zip
                https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1382534

1. Abstract.

JBoss EAP's JMX Invoker Servlet is exposed by default on port 8080/TCP. The
communication employs serialized Java objects, encapsulated in HTTP
requests and responses.

The server deserializes these objects without checking the object type. This
behavior can be exploited to cause a denial of service and potentially
execute arbitrary code.

The objects that can cause the DoS are based on known disclosed payloads
taken from:

- https://gist.github.com/coekie/a27cc406fc9f3dc7a70d

Currently there is no known chain that allows code execution on JBoss EAP,
however new chains are discovered every day.

2. Example Attack Session.

Submit an authenticated POST request to the JMX Invoker Servlet URL (for
example: http://localhost:8080/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet) with one of the
following objects in the body of the request:

    * 01_BigString_limited.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 02_SerialDOS_limited.ser: the application server will require
      about 2 minutes to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.
    * 03_BigString.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 04_SerialDOS.ser: the application server will require an
      unknown amount of time to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.

3. Affected Platforms.

This vulnerability affects versions 4 and 5 of JBoss EAP.

4. Fix.

Red Hat will not fix the issue because JBoss EAP 4 is out of maintenance
support and JBoss EAP 5 is close to the end of its maintenance period.

5. Proof Of Concept.

See jboss_payload.zip (40842.zip) and Example Attack Session above.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Red Hat JBoss EAP deserialization of untrusted data

---

*From*: Agazzini Maurizio <inode () mediaservice net>

*Date*: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 17:09:42 +0100

```
Security Advisory           @ Mediaservice.net Srl
(#05, 23/11/2016)           Data Security Division

         Title: Red Hat JBoss EAP deserialization of untrusted data
   Application: JBoss EAP 5.2.X and prior versions
   Description: The application server deserializes untrusted data via
                the JMX Invoker Servlet. This can lead to a DoS via
                resource exhaustion and potentially remote code
                execution.
        Author: Federico Dotta <federico.dotta () mediaservice net>
                Maurizio Agazzini <inode () mediaservice net>
 Vendor Status: Will not fix
 CVE Candidate: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has
assigned
                the name CVE-2016-7065 to this issue.
    References: <http://lab.mediaservice.net/advisory/2016-05-jboss.txt>
                <http://lab.mediaservice.net/code/jboss_payload.zip>
                <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1382534>

1. Abstract.

JBoss EAP's JMX Invoker Servlet is exposed by default on port 8080/TCP.
The communication employs serialized Java objects, encapsulated in HTTP
requests and responses.

The server deserializes these objects without checking the object type.
This behavior can be exploited to cause a denial of service and
potentially execute arbitrary code.

The objects that can cause the DoS are based on known disclosed payloads
taken from:

- <https://gist.github.com/coekie/a27cc406fc9f3dc7a70d>

Currently there is no known chain that allows code execution on JBoss
EAP, however new chains are discovered every day.

2. Example Attack Session.

Submit an authenticated POST request to the JMX Invoker Servlet URL (for
example: <http://localhost:8080/invoker/JMXInvokerServlet>) with one of
the following objects in the body of the request:

    * 01_BigString_limited.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 02_SerialDOS_limited.ser: the application server will require
      about 2 minutes to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.
    * 03_BigString.ser: it's a string object; the server will
      reply in a normal way (object size similar to the next one).
    * 04_SerialDOS.ser: the application server will require an
      unknown amount of time to execute the request with 100% CPU usage.

3. Affected Platforms.

This vulnerability affects versions 4 and 5 of JBoss EAP.

4. Fix.

Red Hat will not fix the issue because JBoss EAP 4 is out of maintenance
support and JBoss EAP 5 is close to the end of its maintenance period.

5. Proof Of Concept.

See jboss_payload.zip and Example Attack Session above.

6. Timeline

06/10/2016 - First communication sent to Red Hat Security Response Team
07/10/2016 - Red Hat Security Response Team response, Bug 1382534
23/11/2016 - Security Advisory released
