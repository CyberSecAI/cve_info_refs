- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installation script `studioexpressinstall` for Teradata Studio Express v15.12.00.00 creates multiple files and directories within the `/tmp` directory insecurely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a race condition caused by the insecure creation of temporary files and directories in `/tmp`. A malicious local user can create symbolic links in `/tmp` that point to other files, leading to potential file clobbering or privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to privilege escalation or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires a malicious user to create a symbolic link in `/tmp` prior to the execution of the vulnerable installation script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create files and symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory.
