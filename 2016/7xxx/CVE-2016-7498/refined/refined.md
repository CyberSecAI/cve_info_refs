Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7498:

**Root Cause:**
A regression in the `cleanup_incomplete_migrations` periodic task within OpenStack Nova. A previous fix for a similar issue (OSSA-2015-017 / CVE-2015-3280) was inadvertently reverted, reintroducing the vulnerability in Nova version 13.0.0 (Mitaka). The filtering logic was modified such that it caused instances in the 'resize' state to not be properly cleaned up.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of instance deletion during resize operations
- The `cleanup_incomplete_migrations` task failed to remove the original instance from the compute node when it was in a resize state and subsequently deleted.
- The root cause was a flawed filtering condition in the periodic cleanup task, which did not correctly identify instances that needed to be cleaned up during a resize operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could repeatedly trigger resize operations and then delete instances. This would lead to orphaned instances and associated resources being left behind on the compute nodes.
- Resource exhaustion:  Over time, the accumulation of these orphaned resources can lead to the compute nodes running out of space/resources potentially impacting the availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated users: An authenticated user with the ability to create, resize, and delete instances could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with the privileges to launch instances and perform resize operations within OpenStack Nova.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges beyond a normal user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reintroduced in Nova 13.0.0 (Mitaka), a regression of a prior fix.
- The fix was included in nova-13.1.0 and later versions.
- This issue is similar to OSSA-2015-017 (CVE-2015-3280).
