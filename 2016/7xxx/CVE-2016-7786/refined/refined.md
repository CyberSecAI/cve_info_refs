Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the Sophos Cyberoam UTM device. Specifically, it's a Direct Object Reference vulnerability. Low-privileged users can access administrative functionalities by directly requesting the corresponding URLs, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can access pages and functions intended for administrators, thus escalating their privileges.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The system fails to properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resources.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application directly uses URLs corresponding to administrative functionalities without proper authorization checks, allowing users to bypass access restrictions by directly requesting these URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** Attackers can access sensitive information meant for administrators, such as license details, system information, and logs.
*  **Integrity**: Attackers may be able to modify system configurations or other sensitive data.
*   **Availability:** System availability can be affected due to unauthorized actions, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack can be initiated remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Sophos Cyberoam UTM device by sending HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Admin URLs:** The attacker needs to discover administrative URLs, which can be achieved by observing network traffic when logged in as an admin user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Sophos Cyberoam UTM device.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects the `Licenseinformation.jsp` file, which is part of the Access Restriction component in Sophos Cyberoam UTM CR25iNG version 10.6.3 MR-5.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls).
*   The exploit involves logging in as a low-privileged user, accessing administrative URLs (such as `/corporate/webpages/dashboard/LicenseInformation.jsp`) and gaining access to restricted information or functionality.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity.
*   The fix is to upgrade to version 10.6.5 or later of the Sophos Cyberoam UTM firmware.
