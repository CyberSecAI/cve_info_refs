Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-7800:

**Root Cause:**

*   An unsigned integer underflow occurs within the `parse8BIM` function in `coders/meta.c` of GraphicsMagick. This function is responsible for parsing 8BIM metadata chunks, which are often attached to JPEG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsigned Integer Underflow:** The code calculates a size value using an unsigned integer. Due to a flaw in the logic, this calculation results in an underflow, leading to a huge (and incorrect) size value.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The incorrect, large size value is then used to allocate a memory buffer on the heap. The allocation leads to a heap overflow since the actual size is much smaller than the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The heap overflow leads to an application crash. This can prevent the affected software from processing images correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specifically crafted image file, likely a JPEG, containing a malicious 8BIM chunk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious image file to an application that uses the vulnerable GraphicsMagick library for image processing. This might happen through file uploads, or any other scenario where image processing is triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the 8BIM metadata parser, which is part of the GraphicsMagick library, and it affects the way that the application handles image metadata.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, and does not require local access to the system.
*   The provided source code patch link shows the fix implemented by the developers.
*   The provided information is consistent with the CVE description.
*   The severity is rated as "moderate" by SUSE, but "important" in other sources

The information from the different sources confirms that the vulnerability is due to an integer underflow when parsing 8BIM metadata in GraphicsMagick, leading to a heap overflow and ultimately a denial of service.
