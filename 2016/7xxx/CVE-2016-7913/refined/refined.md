Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7913:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content from `usn.ubuntu.com`, `access.redhat.com`, and `bugzilla.redhat.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2016-7913 and describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the `tuner-xc2028` media driver of the Linux kernel. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `xc2028_set_config` function within the `tuner-xc2028` media driver in the Linux kernel. This occurs when the firmware name is omitted from the `xc2028_config` structure, leading to memory being freed and then accessed later.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free due to incorrect management of memory associated with the firmware name. The `xc2028_set_config` function frees the firmware name, and then a subsequent access to that memory leads to the use-after-free condition. Additionally, there's a potential locking issue where the mutex is not always unlocked when a memory allocation error occurs, which is a fix in a later bug report.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A local attacker exploiting this can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. The provided bugzilla entries indicate that while privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out due to the nature of the flaw, it's considered unlikely.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local attackers with the ability to load the `tuner-xc2028` module can trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The specific trigger involves omitting the firmware name when configuring the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs local access to the system.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to interact with the kernel's media subsystem, specifically the `tuner-xc2028` module.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry ([Bug 1402885](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1402885)) provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including how it is triggered:
    > "The `xc2028_set_config` function in `drivers/media/tuners/tuner-xc2028.c` in the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via vectors involving omission of the firmware name from a certain data structure."
*   A patch for this vulnerability is available on the kernel git repository ( <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8dfbcc4351a0b6d2f2d77f367552f48ffefafe18>).
*   The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel since before version 4.6.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3798-1 and USN-3798-2) confirm this vulnerability affects Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and 12.04 ESM (Trusty HWE) respectively.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2018:1062 and RHSA-2019:1170) covers this CVE, listing the affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.

**4. Impact:**

*   The primary impact is a denial-of-service due to the system crash. However, potential for arbitrary code execution exists.
*   Local attackers with the ability to load the `tuner-xc2028` module, which is used for tv tuner cards equipped with the Xceive XC3028/XC3018/XC2028 chip, are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability exists since Linux kernel version 2.6.21-rc1 and up to version 4.13-rc3.
