- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of pointer casting in Microsoft SQL Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Elevation of privilege vulnerability due to incorrect pointer casting.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain elevated privileges, which could lead to the ability to view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have credentials that allow access to an affected SQL server database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have existing credentials that grant them access to the SQL Server database.
