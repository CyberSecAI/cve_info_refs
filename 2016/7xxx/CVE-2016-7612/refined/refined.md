Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7612:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of `externalMethod` overrides within the kernel's MIG (Mach Interface Generator) subsystem. Specifically, the `io_service_add_notification_ool_64` MIG method, used for adding notifications to I/O Kit services, calls another internal MIG handler. The outer handler can return success even when the inner handler fails and doesn't take ownership of mach ports passed as arguments, specifically the `wake_port`. This discrepancy violates the `ipc_kobject_server`'s ownership model, which assumes that a successful return implies ownership of all passed rights (including mach ports).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Reference Counting:** The core vulnerability is a reference count leak on `ipc_port_t` objects. Because the outer MIG method returns success even when the inner method fails to take ownership of a mach port, the reference count on the port is not decremented, leading to a leak.
*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** By repeatedly exploiting the reference count leak, an attacker can overflow the 32-bit `io_references` field to 0. The next use of the port will then cause the ref count to increment to 1, then decrement to 0 again, leading to the object being freed while a dangling pointer remains in the process's ports table. This is the UAF condition.
* **Type Confusion:** The outer MIG handler (`io_service_add_notification_ool_64`) is returning KERN_SUCCESS even when the inner handler (`internal_io_service_add_notification`) fails which leads to the port not being deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service:** The most immediate impact of the UAF is a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The UAF also provides the opportunity for more sophisticated attacks, including the potential for arbitrary code execution in the kernel. Specifically, with a dangling pointer in the process's ports table it may be possible to obtain send rights to other task's task ports.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MIG interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `io_service_add_notification_ool_64` MIG method by sending a crafted message.
*   **Crafted OOL Descriptor:** The attacker needs to provide a valid OOL (Out-of-Line) memory descriptor, but with data that will cause the inner `OSUnserializeXML` method to return an error. This will cause the inner handler to not take ownership of the mach port, and leak it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send mach messages to the vulnerable service. This can be achieved through local access on the system.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The exploit states that the code is reachable from all sandboxed environments meaning that even sandboxed applications can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB):**

*   The exploit code mentions it takes ~8 hours to cause a kernel panic on older dual core systems with two threads.
*   The exploit does not involve any resource leaks, which means it can be run even on constrained devices, although it would be slower.
*   The advisory recommends either to use a saturating reference counter (like OSObjects), or to fix the reference count issue in the handler.

In summary, CVE-2016-7612 is a kernel-level vulnerability caused by an inconsistency in mach port ownership leading to a reference count leak, and ultimately a use-after-free. This can be exploited by local attackers to cause a denial of service and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
