Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a global buffer over-read in the `profile.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the code attempts to read beyond the bounds of a global buffer during EXIF profile processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Global Buffer Over-read:** The code reads data from a memory location that is outside the allocated boundaries of a global buffer. This occurs while processing EXIF profiles. The vulnerable code is related to the processing of EXIF format tags.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The code lacks proper validation to ensure that the read operations remain within the allocated memory region.
- The vulnerability is located in `MagickCore/profile.c`, specifically within the `SyncExifProfile` function, when handling EXIF tags with invalid formats.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The over-read can cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The AddressSanitizer output clearly shows the program aborting due to the error.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, a buffer over-read can sometimes be a precursor to more serious vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution. While this specific case resulted in a crash, it is possible that under different conditions, a similar out-of-bounds read could lead to control of the programâ€™s execution flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image:** The attack vector involves processing a crafted image file, particularly one with a malformed EXIF profile. The `mogrify` utility of ImageMagick can trigger the vulnerability when processing such images.
- **ImageMagick Utilities:** The `mogrify` utility is specifically mentioned as being capable of triggering this vulnerability. Other image processing utilities could also potentially be attack vectors if they process EXIF data through the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image file to an ImageMagick utility that will parse the image and its metadata, specifically its EXIF profile.
- **Target Uses ImageMagick:** The target system must be using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick to be susceptible.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer, a memory error detector.
- The patch for this vulnerability includes an additional check to prevent reading an out-of-bounds format tag.
- The provided information includes the commit hash of the fix.
- The vulnerability was reported by Marco Grassi of Tencent's Keen Lab.

**Summary of extracted details:**
