Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in RESTEasy, a framework for building RESTful Web Services. Under specific conditions, RESTEasy could be forced to use `SerializableProvider` to parse requests. This leads to the deserialization of potentially untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the unsafe deserialization of data. When `SerializableProvider` is triggered, it attempts to deserialize incoming data without proper validation, making it susceptible to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious request that triggers the vulnerable deserialization process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** An unauthenticated attacker needs to send a specific crafted request to the server.
*   **Knowledge of RESTEasy:** The attacker would need some understanding of how RESTEasy works and how to trigger the use of `SerializableProvider`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Mikhail Egorov (Odin).
*   Red Hat rated this vulnerability as "Important."
*   The fix was included in `resteasy-base-3.0.6-4.el7` package which addressed the deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2016-7050)
*   Red Hat has issued RHSA-2016:2604 to address this issue for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.
*   The bug report mentions that JBoss Fuse 6 was initially thought to be affected, but further analysis showed it is not directly vulnerable but its `Fabic8` support webapp might use a vulnerable REST client and thus should not be considered exploitable in that context.

The provided content gives good detail on the vulnerability, including the affected products, how it can be exploited, and how to remediate it with the released security advisory.
