Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The PowerDNS Authoritative Server's web server is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The web server doesn't properly manage incoming TCP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of connection management:** The web server does not effectively handle a large number of incoming TCP connections.
- **File descriptor exhaustion:**  The vulnerability is triggered when the web server runs out of available file descriptors due to the large number of connections.
- **Process termination:** When the server runs out of file descriptors, it raises an exception, leading to the termination of the entire PowerDNS process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can cause the PowerDNS server to become unavailable, preventing it from responding to legitimate DNS queries. This can lead to service disruption.
- **Degraded service:**  The excessive CPU load can cause a degradation of performance, affecting the serverâ€™s capacity to function normally.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker without requiring prior authentication.
- **TCP connection flood:** The attacker floods the web server with a large number of TCP connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable PowerDNS server.
- **Ability to send TCP connections:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a large number of TCP connections to the web server.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and including 3.4.10 and 4.0.1 are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:**  The issue is fixed in PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions 3.4.11 and 4.0.2.
- **Workaround:**  Disabling the web server or restricting access to it through a firewall can prevent the attack.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mongo.
- A patch is available for those unable to upgrade immediately.
