Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) driver improperly handling user access to certain files. Specifically, the driver calls `ZwDeleteFile` without specifying the `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` flag. This omission allows an attacker to bypass access checks and delete arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The core weakness is that the VHD driver allows deletion of files the user wouldn't normally have access to, due to missing access checks on file deletion operations.
*   **Missing Access Checks:** The `ZwDeleteFile` function is called without `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK`, which means standard access control mechanisms are bypassed, allowing the deletion of any file or directory regardless of user privileges.
*   **Symbolic Link Abuse:** The vulnerability can be exploited using symbolic links to redirect the delete operation to an arbitrary location.
*   **Mount Point Redirection:**  The vulnerability also can be triggered through mount points, due to `ZwDeleteFile` opening the target file without specifying `FILE_DIRECTORY_FILE` or `FILE_NON_DIRECTORY_FILE` flags, allowing redirection to files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):**  An attacker can gain elevated privileges by deleting files that are typically protected (e.g. files in `ProgramData` or `Windows\Temp`).
*   **File Manipulation:** By deleting protected files, an attacker can potentially replace them with crafted ones, leading to further exploitation.
*   **System Instability:** Deleting critical system files can lead to system instability or crashes.
*   **Data Loss:** Users can lose important data if they are targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker requires access to the local system.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application on the vulnerable system.
*   **VHD Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered during VHD creation, specifically when the driver attempts to delete `.rct` or `.mrt` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user. This vulnerability does not require admin rights for the exploitation phase.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

**Additional details from Exploit-DB:**
*   The exploit uses the VHD creation process to trigger the vulnerable `ZwDeleteFile` call.
*   The exploit uses a symbolic link to redirect the deletion of a `.rct` file to the target arbitrary file.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code shows how an attacker can delete an arbitrary file on Windows 10.
*   The PoC creates a VHD, which internally leads to deletion of RCT files. By manipulating that process via mount points, the deletion of the desired arbitrary file can be achieved.
*   The exploit doesn't need admin rights, but the code execution will be restricted by the user's security context.
*   Opening a VHD file goes through access checks and therefore cannot be exploited from a sandbox.
