## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple VHD Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when the Windows Virtual Hard Disk Driver fails to properly handle user access to certain files. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could manipulate files in locations not intended to be available to the user.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would need access to the local system and the ability to execute a specially crafted application on the system.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the kernel API restricts access to these files.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |

Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=915

Windows: VHDMP ZwDeleteFile Arbitrary File Deletion EoP
Platform: Windows 10 10586 and 14393. No idea about 7 or 8.1 versions.
Class: Elevation of Privilege

Summary:
The VHDMP driver doesn’t safely delete files leading to arbitrary file deletion which could result in EoP.

Description:

The VHDMP driver is used to mount VHD and ISO files so that they can be accessed as a normal mounted volume. There are numerous places where the driver calls ZwDeleteFile without specifying OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK. This can be abused to delete any arbitrary file or directory on the filesystem by abusing symbolic links to redirect the delete file name to an arbitrary location. Also due to the behaviour of ZwDeleteFile we also don’t need to play games with the DosDevices directory or anything like that, the system call opens the target file without specifying FILE_DIRECTORY_FILE or FILE_NON_DIRECTORY_FILE flags, this means it’s possible to use a mount point even to redirect to a file due to the way reparsing works in the kernel.

Some places where ZwDeleteFile is called (based on 10586 x64 vhdmp.sys) are:

VhdmpiDeleteRctFiles
VhdmpiCleanupFileWrapper
VhdmpiInitializeVhdSetExtract
VhdmpiCtCreateEnableTrackingRequest
VhdmpiMultiStageSwitchLogFile
VhdmpiApplySnapshot
And much much more.

You get the idea, as far as I can tell none of these calls actually pass OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK flag so all would be vulnerable (assuming you can specify the filename suitably). Note this doesn’t need admin rights as we never mount the VHD. However you can’t use it in a sandbox as opening the drive goes through multiple access checks.

While deleting files/directories might not seem to be too important you can use it to delete files in ProgramData or Windows\Temp which normally are OWNER RIGHTS locked to the creator. This could then be recreated by the user due to default DACLs and abuse functionality of other services/applications.

Proof of Concept:

I’ve provided a PoC as a C# source code file. You need to compile with .NET 4 or higher. It will delete an arbitrary file specified on the command line. It abuses the fact that during VHD creation the kernel will delete the .rct/.mrt files (this limits the poc to Win10 only). So we drop a test.vhd.rct mount point pointing at the target into the same directory and call create.

1) Compile the C# source code file.
2) Execute the poc on Win 10 passing the path to the file to delete. It will check that the file is present and can’t be deleted.
3) It should print that it successfully deleted the file

Expected Result:
The target file isn’t deleted, the VHD creation fails.

Observed Result:
The target file is deleted.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
