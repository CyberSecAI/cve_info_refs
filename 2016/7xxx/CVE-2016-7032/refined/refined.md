{
  "CVE-2016-7032": {
    "Description": "A flaw exists in sudoâ€™s *noexec* functionality that may allow a user with sudo privileges to run additional commands even when the `NOEXEC` tag has been applied to a command that uses either the `system()` or `popen()` functions.",
    "Root cause": "The `sudo_noexec.so` library, which is intended to prevent command execution by replacing exec() family functions, doesn't properly intercept internal calls within the C library, such as those made by `system()` and `popen()` which in turn invoke the shell.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete interception of command execution functions.",
      "Reliance on replacing globally visible exec() functions while some systems use internal symbols for calls within the C library."
    ],
    "Impact": "A user with sudo privileges and a `NOEXEC` tag applied to their commands, or when the noexec Defaults setting is enabled, can bypass these restrictions to execute shell built-in commands and modify system files using I/O redirection. This could include modifying the sudoers file itself leading to further privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "Exploiting the `system()` and `popen()` functions, invoked by commands with sudo privileges that have `NOEXEC` set."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
          "A user with sudo privileges on the system.",
        "Configuration where `NOEXEC` is used either as a Defaults setting or as a tag applied to commands the attacker is permitted to run."
