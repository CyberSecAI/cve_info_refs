Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7520:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `www.openwall.com`, `bugzilla.redhat.com`, `bugs.debian.org` and `github.com`  explicitly mentions CVE-2016-7520 and links it to a heap-buffer-overflow read in `coders/hdr.c`, confirming its relevance. The description in the openwall.com content is consistent with CVE descriptions.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow read in the `HDRWriteRunlengthPixels` function within `coders/hdr.c`. Specifically, it occurs when processing HDR image files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A buffer is allocated with insufficient size, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the program tries to access memory outside the allocated region.
    *   **Out-of-bounds Read:**  The program attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Crash/Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Maliciously crafted HDR Image:** An attacker can create a specially crafted HDR image file to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes a malicious HDR image file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an image file to ImageMagick. This could be through a web application, email, or other methods where ImageMagick is used to process images.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The `launchpad.net` content provides a detailed AddressSanitizer (ASan) output showing the exact location of the heap-buffer-overflow:
    *   `READ of size 1 at 0xb3302f40 thread T0`
    *   `#0 0x85250f6 in HDRWriteRunlengthPixels /home/user/Desktop/ImageMagick/coders/hdr.c:622`
    *   This points to line 622 of `coders/hdr.c` inside `HDRWriteRunlengthPixels`.
*   The fix is referenced in the `github.com` commit `14e606db148d6ebcaae20f1e1d6d71903ca4a556`, and the fix expands the memory allocation, specifically:
    *   `pixels=(unsigned char *) AcquireQuantumMemory(image->columns+128,4*sizeof(*pixels));`
    *  This change indicates the memory is now allocated with an additional 128 elements which addresses the vulnerability.
*   The `bugs.debian.org` content shows that the bug was fixed in versions `8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u4` and `8:6.9.5.9+dfsg-1`.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry confirms the issue with the vulnerability and mentions that it's been resolved in ImageMagick version `7.0.1`.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The `openwall.com` message provides a comprehensive overview of multiple ImageMagick vulnerabilities, with CVE-2016-7520 specifically assigned to the HDR file handling issue.
*   The `launchpad.net` content includes a sample input file (`not_kitty.hdr`) that triggers the vulnerability and shows its use during fuzzing.
*   The `bugs.debian.org` report shows that this was part of a large number of security fixes to ImageMagick.

In summary, the provided content indicates that CVE-2016-7520 is a heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability in ImageMagick's HDR image handling code. It can be exploited by a malicious HDR image file, potentially leading to application crashes. The vulnerability was addressed by allocating a slightly larger buffer during HDR image processing.
