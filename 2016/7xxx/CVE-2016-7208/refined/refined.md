  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine when handling objects in memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to visit the site.",
      "ActiveX control: Embedding a malicious ActiveX control marked 'safe for initialization' in an application or Office document hosting the Edge rendering engine.",
       "Compromised websites: Leveraging compromised or user-content hosting websites to deliver malicious code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or embed the malicious code and convince the user to interact with it, typically by visiting a website or opening a document. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system prior to exploitation. The attacker gains the same privileges as the user after exploitation."
