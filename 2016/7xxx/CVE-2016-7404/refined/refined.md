It makes the following changes:\n\n* Permissions for /etc/sysconfig/heat-params inside Magnum\n  created instances are tightened to 0600 (used to be 0755).\n* Certificate retrieval is modified to work without the need\n  for a Keystone trust.\n* The cluster's Keystone trust id is only passed into\n  instances for clusters where that is actually needed. This\n  prevents the trustee user from consuming the trust in cases\n  where it is not needed.\n* The configuration setting trust/cluster_user_trust (False by\n  default) is introduced. It needs to be explicitely enabled\n  by the cloud operator to allow clusters that need the\n  trust_id to be passed into instances to work. Without this\n  setting, attempts to create such clusters will fail.\n\nPlease note, that none of these changes apply to existing\nclusters. They will have to be deleted and rebuilt to benefit\nfrom these changes.\n\n(cherry picked from commit e93d82e8b3bc19211efd54edc17aebdca50670c1)\n\nChanges for backport:\n\n* Moved cluster_user_trust setting to magnum/common/keystone.py\n* Resolved merge conflicts.\n* Fixed unit tests with configuration overrides."

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability was due to several issues:\n\n1.  Incorrect file permissions for `/etc/sysconfig/heat-params` inside Magnum-created instances. The file had overly permissive permissions (0755), which allowed any user within the instance to read and potentially modify it.\n2.  Unnecessary requirement for a Keystone trust for certificate retrieval. This could potentially expose sensitive information through the trust.\n3.  The cluster's Keystone trust ID being passed into instances even when not required. This allowed the trustee user to potentially consume the trust unnecessarily.\n",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file permissions",
        "Unnecessary exposure of Keystone trust",
         "Unnecessary passing of cluster's Keystone trust ID"
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of these vulnerabilities was that Magnum-created instances had potentially full API access to creating the user's OpenStack account. This could allow an attacker to:\n\n1.  Gain unauthorized access to the OpenStack environment via the Magnum instance.\n2.  Modify the configuration of heat-params to escalate privileges or cause a denial of service.\n3.  Consume the Keystone trust associated with the cluster when not needed, potentially disrupting the functionality of the cluster.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:\n\n1.  Compromising a Magnum-created instance and exploiting the insecure file permissions to access or modify `/etc/sysconfig/heat-params`.\n2.  Leveraging the unnecessary Keystone trust to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access.\n3.  Utilizing the cluster's Keystone trust ID, which was unnecessarily exposed in the instance environment.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the following capabilities/position:\n\n1.  Ability to compromise a Magnum-created instance.\n2.  Knowledge of the location and format of the `/etc/sysconfig/heat-params` file.\n3. Ability to leverage the exposed Keystone trust ID.\n4.  Understanding of the OpenStack API and how to interact with it using the provided credentials."
