```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `$this->location_data` variable in `framework/core/models/expConfig.php` is directly controlled by user input via the `src` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL code through the `src` parameter. Since it's a blind SQL injection, the attacker would not receive direct output from the query but can infer information by observing the time it takes for the database to respond.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can inject SQL code through the `src` GET parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the web interface, without requiring specific privileges, which makes it a remote attack."
