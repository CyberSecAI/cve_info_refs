{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when the 'properties' hash table of a serialized object is resized during unserialization in PHP. The var_hash struct, which maintains references to unserialized values, is not updated when the hash table is resized, resulting in dangling pointers to freed memory. Additionally, accessing a DateInterval objectâ€™s properties during unserialization also triggers the vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Dangling pointers",
      "Insecure deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By controlling the freed memory region, an attacker can gain full control of the server and execute arbitrary code, which can lead to malware distribution, website defacement, or data theft.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By creating a new object property dynamically during unserialization through methods like __wakeup.",
      "By triggering the 'get_properties' method of 'DateInterval' during unserialization.",
      "By exploiting the ability to call __toString methods on objects during unserialization."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted serialized string to the vulnerable unserialize() function in PHP."
