Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `valider_xml.php` file of SPIP. Specifically, the `var_url` parameter, intended to specify a URL for XML validation, is not properly validated when used to traverse directories and list files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Enumeration / Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to list files and directories on the server by manipulating the `var_url` parameter, exploiting a path traversal issue. This can be achieved through direct path manipulation (`/etc`) and using PHP wrappers (`file:///etc`).
*   **CWE-538** indicates exposure of information through a listing of files, directories, and/or shared resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can enumerate files and directories on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files (e.g., `.ini` files in `/etc`).
*   This information disclosure can aid further attacks or reveal sensitive system details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `valider_xml.php` script, specifically manipulating the `var_url`, `ext`, and `recur` parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SPIP instance.
*   **No Authentication:** The provided text indicates that access control for the `valider_xml.php` script is present, but does not properly prevent this vulnerability from occurring, and that the check was later tightened to only allow webmasters access to the function. This suggests that no specific authentication or authorization level was required to exploit the file enumeration vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `valider_xml.php` file.
*   The `var_url` parameter is used in conjunction with the `preg_files` function to list files.
*   The initial fixes were circumvented by using PHP wrappers, such as `file://`, to bypass checks.

**Vulnerable Code:**

The vulnerable code is located within the `valider_xml.php` file. Specifically, the logic around the `$url` variable, used with `preg_files`, leads to the vulnerability when $url can be controlled using `var_url`.

```php
if (is_dir($url)) {
    $dir = (substr($url, -1, 1) === '/') ? $url : "$url/";
    $ext = !preg_match('/^[.*\w]+$/', $req_ext) ? 'php' : $req_ext;
    $files = preg_files($dir, "$ext$", $limit, $rec);
    if (!$files and $ext !== 'html') {
      $files = preg_files($dir, 'html$', $limit, $rec);
      if ($files) {
        $ext = 'html';
      }
    }
    if ($files) {
      $res = valider_dir($files, $ext, $url);
      list($err, $res) = valider_resultats($res, $ext === 'html');
```

**Proof of Concept:**

*   Enumerating `.ini` files inside `/etc` (SPIP 3.1.1):
    ```
    <http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=/etc&ext=ini&recur=2>
    ```
*   Bypassing SPIP 3.1.2 protection using PHP Wrappers:
    ```
    <http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=file:///etc&ext=ini&recur=2>
    ```

**Fix:**
The fix involved several commits that addressed the path traversal issue, including hardening the access check for `valider_xml.php` and preventing `var_url` from containing directory traversal strings such as "../".
