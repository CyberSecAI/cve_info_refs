Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7545:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `sandbox` tool within the `policycoreutils` package. The tool was susceptible to a `TIOCSTI` ioctl attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **TIOCSTI ioctl Vulnerability:** The `sandbox` tool didn't properly isolate the sandboxed process from the parent shell's terminal. The `TIOCSTI` ioctl allows a process to push characters into the terminal input buffer of another process, which can be the parent shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Sandbox Escape:** A malicious program, when executed through the `sandbox` command, could use the `TIOCSTI` vulnerability to inject arbitrary commands into the parent shell's terminal input buffer. This results in arbitrary command execution within the parent shell's context, effectively bypassing the SELinux sandbox restrictions.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** This escape allows the attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the user who invoked the `sandbox` command, even if the sandboxed process itself has restricted privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Execution:** An attacker needs to execute a specially crafted program by using the `sandbox` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute a program by using the `sandbox` command.
-   The attacker would need to create an exploit binary designed to use `TIOCSTI` to inject commands into the parent shell.

**Technical Details:**

- The `sandbox` tool spawns a new process, but it does not create a new session, inheriting the terminal of the parent process. A fix was created by forking, creating a new session id, and exec'ing the sandboxed command.
- The vulnerable code is in the `policycoreutils/sandbox/sandbox` file.
