```
Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple out-of-bounds read and integer overflow vulnerabilities were found in tcpdump affecting the decoding of various protocols.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Out-of-bounds read and integer overflow vulnerabilities.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker could create a crafted pcap file or send specially crafted packets to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode which could cause it to display incorrect data, crash or enter an infinite loop, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

Attack vectors: Crafted pcap file or specially crafted network packets sent to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode (without -w).

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a network segment where tcpdump is running or provide a malicious pcap file.
