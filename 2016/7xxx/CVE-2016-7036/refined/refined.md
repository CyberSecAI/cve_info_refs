Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2016-7036:

**CVE Description:** The provided CVE description is a placeholder, but the content from the github links indicates that this CVE is related to a timing attack vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of standard string comparison (`sig == self.sign(msg)`) in the `verify` function within the `HMACKey` class. Standard string comparisons can leak timing information, potentially allowing an attacker to deduce the correct signature by observing the time taken for comparisons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Leakage:** The original implementation used a standard equality check, which short-circuits as soon as a difference is found. This timing difference, though small, could be measured by an attacker to determine if the comparison has been successful for several initial characters.
- **Non-constant time comparison**: Using the == operator for comparison of the signature provides different times, depending on the position in the signature where the mismatch occurs

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Signature Forgery:** An attacker could potentially forge signatures or tokens without knowing the secret HMAC key by observing subtle timing differences in the verification process. The more characters of the signature the attacker guesses correctly, the longer the comparison will take, providing an information leak.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Timing Analysis:** The attacker would need the ability to send verification requests and analyze the response times. This can typically be done remotely if the vulnerable software exposes such verification functionality in its API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to send verification requests:** The attacker must be able to send requests that involve HMAC signature verification.
- **Ability to measure timing differences:** The attacker must be able to measure the time it takes for the server to respond. Precise time measurement might be required.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was addressed by replacing the standard string comparison with a constant time comparison using the `constant_time_string_compare` function. This function uses `hmac.compare_digest` if available, otherwise implements a constant time comparison by using a bitwise comparison over each character that does not short-circuit. This change was made in commit `89b46353b9f611e9da38de3d2fedf52331167b93` and included in release 1.3.2.
