## Security Update for Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers (3199135)

Published: November 8, 2016 | Updated: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 2.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3199135](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3199135).

## Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings

## Vulnerability Information

## Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-7214

An Information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to a [Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) bypass. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7214](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7214) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

Multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7215](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7215) | No | No |
| Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7246](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7246) | No | No |
| Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7255](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7255) | Yes | Yes\* |

\*Note for CVE-2016-7255: Microsoft implemented new exploit mitigations in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update version of the win32k kernel component. These Windows 10 Anniversary Update mitigations, which were developed based on proactive internal research, stop all observed in-the-wild instances of this exploit.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for the vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for the vulnerabilities.

## Windows Bowser.sys Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-7218

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Windows when the Windows bowser.sys kernel-mode driver fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could potentially disclose contents of system memory to which they should not have access.

To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker would run a specially crafted application in user mode. The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7218](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7218) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.
