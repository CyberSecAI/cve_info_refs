Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver's failure to properly handle objects in memory. Specifically, the issue is within the handling of the `NtUserMagSetContextInformation` system call. By providing specific arguments to this system call, an attacker can cause corruption of kernel state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Kernel State Corruption:** Improper handling of objects in memory during the `NtUserMagSetContextInformation` system call leads to kernel state corruption.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The memory corruption allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, thus escalating privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges, allowing them to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code in kernel mode due to the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. This can be achieved by obtaining local access, implying the attack is local in nature.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to construct a malicious application that exploits the `NtUserMagSetContextInformation` system call with specific arguments.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
*   Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors or workarounds for the vulnerability.
*  The advisory from Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned the identifier ZDI-16-594/ZDI-CAN-4020 to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS score of 6.9, with an attack vector of Local, medium attack complexity, no authentication required, and impact of complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
