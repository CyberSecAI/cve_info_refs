{
  "CVE-2016-7056": {
    "description": "A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL 1.0.1u and before that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the failure to set the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for ECDSA signing nonces in OpenSSL's ecdsa_sign_setup function. This oversight prevents the use of a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse function, leading to a timing attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Timing attack vulnerability",
        "Inconsistent use of constant-time flags",
        "Cache timing attack possible through vulnerable modular inversion implementation."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys by exploiting the timing vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access is required to perform the cache-timing attack.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access, the ability to monitor the timing of operations, and the capability to analyze the collected data.",
    },
     "affected_software": {
        "openssl": [
