[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1801)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 for RHEL 6 and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector (mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was possible, under some circumstances, for that application to retain references to the request or response objects and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. (CVE-2017-5648)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2017-01-11 13:09:48 UTC  ``` From <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/52>  Attack Vector: Local  Vendor: OpenSSL, LibreSSL, BoringSSL  Versions Affected: OpenSSL 1.0.1u and previous versions LibreSSL (pre 6.0 errata 16, pre 5.9 errata 33) BoringSSL pre November 2015  Description: The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. [...] Credit: This issue was reported by Cesar Pereida García and Billy Brumley (Tampere University of Technology).

This CVE (and paper) only relate to a defect in the ECDSA implementation in 1.0.1 or later, a deficiency in a previous implementation, where due to the lack of a BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag in a particular code path the BEEA implementation is used.  Setting VUL-1 to be included with the next triggered OpenSSL release. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c4)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2017-01-23 11:01:19 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1019334) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/451912> Factory / libressl ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2017-01-23 13:01:09 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1019334) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/451915> 42.2 / libressl ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c6)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2017-01-23 15:00:49 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1019334) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/451946> 42.1 / libressl ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c7)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2017-01-27 13:04:47 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1019334) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/452919> Factory / openssl ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-02-06 16:25:36 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

The paper authors went through the openssl code to identify parts where BN_mod_inverse is used like this. They identified such a place, in ecdsa_sign_setup, where the inverse of k is computed using BN_mod_inverse without the flag. This issue was assigned CVE-2016-7056.  However it affected only 1.0.1 and below. OpenSSL 1.0.2 and newer include changes mentioned in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c1). Since that commit, openssl doesn't use BN_mod_inverse co compute the inverse anymore, it uses BN_mod_exp_mont_consttime instead, a function that ensures constant time of the computation. So 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 aren't vulnerable to the timing attack. ``` [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c31)  Marcus Meissner   2017-06-14 09:36:52 UTC  ``` okay, thanks! ``` [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1019334#c35)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-01-16 17:09:46 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:0112-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has 10 fixes is now available.

RHSA-2017:1802 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2017-07-25
# RHSA-2017:1802 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Web Server Service Pack 1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of components for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector (mod\_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod\_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat Native library.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.1, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that when using remote logging with log4j socket server the log4j server would deserialize any log event received via TCP or UDP. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially crafted log event that, during deserialization, would execute arbitrary code in the context of the logger application. (CVE-2017-5645)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat's handling of pipelined requests when "Sendfile" was used. If sendfile processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to be added to the processor cache twice. This could lead to invalid responses or information disclosure. (CVE-2017-5647)
* A vulnerability was discovered in the error page mechanism in Tomcat's DefaultServlet implementation. A crafted HTTP request could cause undesired side effects, possibly including the removal or replacement of the custom error page. (CVE-2017-5664)
* A vulnerability was discovered in tomcat. When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager it was possible, under some circumstances, for that application to retain references to the request or response objects and thereby access and/or modify information associated with another web application. (CVE-2017-5648)

## Solution

Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration files).

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-21 15:01:58 UTC  ``` Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25, accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.   These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.  Affects versions since 2.2.0 up to 2.4.23  External Reference:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#2.4.25>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-21 15:04:26 UTC  ```  Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1406823](show_bug.cgi?id=1406823 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-0736 CVE-2016-2161 CVE-2016-8743 httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1406822#c6)  Brian Hinz    2017-01-31 13:26:23 UTC  ``` I realize that backporting the upstream fix is non-trivial, but is there any kind of status update that you can provide regarding a potential errata release date?  The status is still marked as "NEW", which implies that it's not even being worked on...

Abstract

Side-channel attacks are a serious threat to security-
critical software. To mitigate remote timing and cache-
timing attacks, many ubiquitous cryptography software
libraries feature constant-time implementations of cryp-
tographic primitives. In this work, we disclose a vulner-
ability in OpenSSL 1.0.1u that recovers ECDSA private
keys for the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite the
library featuring both constant-time curve operations and
modular inversion with microarchitecture attack mitiga-
tions. Exploiting this defect, we target the errant mod-
ular inversion code path with a cache-timing and im-
proved performance degradation attack, recovering the
inversion state sequence. We propose a new approach
of extracting a variable number of nonce bits from these
sequences, and improve upon the best theoretical result
to recover private keys in a lattice attack with as few as
50 signatures and corresponding traces. As far as we are
aware, this is the ﬁrst timing attack against OpenSSL EC-
DSA that does not target scalar multiplication, the ﬁrst
side-channel attack on cryptosystems leveraging P-256
constant-time scalar multiplication and furthermore, we
extend our attack to TLS and SSH protocols, both linked
to OpenSSL for P-256 ECDSA signing.

Introduction

Being a widely-deployed open-source cryptographic li-
brary, OpenSSL is a popular target for different cryptan-
alytic attacks, including side-channel attacks that target
cryptosystem implementation weaknesses that can leak

critical algorithm state. As a software library, Open-
SSL provides not only TLS functionality but also cryp-
tographic functionality for applications such as SSH,
IPSec, and VPNs.

Due to its ubiquitous usage, OpenSSL contains ar-
guably one of the most popular software implemen-
tations of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algo-
rithm (ECDSA). OpenSSL’s scalar multiplication algo-
rithm was shown vulnerable to cache-timing attacks in
2009 [6], and attacks continue on the same code path to
this date [2, 4, 10, 27]. Recognizing and responding to
the threat cache-timing attacks pose to cryptosystem im-
plementations, OpenSSL mainlined constant-time scalar
multiplication for several popular standardized curves al-
ready in 2011 [16].

In this work, we disclose a software defect in the
OpenSSL (1.0.1 branch) ECDSA implementation that al-
lows us to design and implement a side-channel cache-
timing attack to recover private keys. Different from
previous work, our attack focuses on the modular inver-
sion operation instead of the typical scalar multiplication,
thus allowing us to target the standardized elliptic curve
P-256, circumventing its constant-time scalar multiplica-
tion implementation. The root cause of the defect is fail-
ure to set a ﬂag in ECDSA signing nonces that indicates
only constant-time code paths should be followed.

the

We

leverage

state-of-the-art

FLUSH+RE-
technique to perform our cache-timing
LOAD [28]
attack. We adapt the technique to OpenSSL’s implemen-
tation of ECDSA and the Binary Extended Euclidean
Algorithm (BEEA). Our spy program probes relevant
memory addresses to create a timing signal trace, then
the signal is processed and converted into a sequence of
right-shift and subtraction (LS) operations correspond-
ing to the BEEA execution state from which we extract
bits of information to create a lattice problem. The
solution to the lattice problem yields the ECDSA secret
key.

We discover that observing as few as 5 operations

from the LS sequence allows us to use every single cap-
tured trace for our attack. This signiﬁcantly reduces both
the required amount of signatures and side-channel data
compared to previous work [8], and maintains a good
signature to lattice dimension ratio.

We build upon the performance degradation technique
of Allan et al. [2] to efﬁciently ﬁnd the memory addresses
with the highest impact to the cache during the degrading
attack. This new approach allows us to accurately ﬁnd
the best candidate memory addresses to slow the mod-
ular inversion by an average factor of 18, giving a high
resolution trace and allowing us to extract the needed bits
of information from all of the traces.

Unlike previous works targeting the wNAF scalar
multiplication code path (for curves such as BitCoin’s
secp256k1) or performing theoretical side-channel anal-
ysis of the BEEA, we are the ﬁrst to demonstrate a practi-
cal cache-timing attack against the BEEA modular inver-
sion, and furthermore OpenSSL’s ECDSA signing im-
plementation with constant-time P-256 scalar multipli-
cation.

Our contributions in this work include the following:

• We identify a bug in OpenSSL that allows a
cache-timing attack on ECDSA signatures, despite
constant-time P-256 scalar multiplication.
(Sec-
tion 3)

• We describe a new quantitative approach that ac-
curately identiﬁes the most accessed victim mem-
ory addresses w.r.t. data caching, then we use them
for an improved performance degradation attack in
combination with the FLUSH+RELOAD technique.
(Section 4.3)

• We describe how to combine the FLUSH+RELOAD
technique with the improved performance degrada-
tion attack to recover side-channel traces and algo-
rithm state from the BEEA execution. (Section 4)
• We present an alternate approach to recovering
nonce bits from the LS sequences, focused on min-
imizing required side-channel information. Using
this approach, we recover bits of information from
every trace, allowing us to use every signature query
to construct and solve a lattice problem, revealing
the secret key with as few as 50 signatures and cor-
responding traces. (Section 4.4)

• We perform a key-recovery cache-timing attack on
the TLS and SSH protocols utilizing OpenSSL for
ECDSA functionality. (Section 5)

2 Background

2.1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography

ECC. Developed in the mid 1980’s, elliptic curves were
introduced to cryptography by Miller [20] and Koblitz

[17] independently. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
became popular mainly for two important reasons: no
sub-exponential time algorithm to solve the elliptic curve
discrete logarithm problem is known for well-chosen pa-
rameters and it operates in the group of points on an el-
liptic curve, compared to the classic multiplicative group
of a ﬁnite ﬁeld, thus allowing the use of smaller param-
eters to achieve the same security levels—consequently
smaller keys and signatures.

Although there are more general forms of elliptic
curves, for the purposes of this paper we restrict to short
Weierstrass curves over prime ﬁelds. With prime p > 3,
all of the x, y ∈ GF(p) solutions to the equation

E : y2 = x3 + ax + b

along with an identity element form an abelian group.
Due to their performance characteristics, the parameters
of interest are the NIST standard curves that set a = −3
and p a Mersenne-like prime.
ECDSA. Throughout this paper, we use the following
notation for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algo-
rithm (ECDSA).
Parameters: A generator G ∈ E of an elliptic curve group
of prime order n and an approved hash function h (e.g.
SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512).
Private-Public key pairs: The private key α is an integer
uniformly chosen from {1 . . n−1} and the corresponding
public key D = [α]G where [i]G denotes scalar-by-point
multiplication using additive group notation. Calculat-
ing the private key given the public key requires solving
the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and for cor-
rectly chosen parameters, this is an intractable problem.
Signing: A given party, Alice, wants to send a signed
message m to Bob. Using her private-public key pair
(αA, DA), Alice performs the following steps:

1. Select uniformly at random a secret nonce k such

that 0 < k < n.

2. Compute r = ([k]G)x mod n.
3. Compute s = k−1(h(m) + αAr) mod n.
4. Alice sends (m, r, s) to Bob.

Verifying: Bob wants to be sure the message he re-
ceived comes from Alice—a valid ECDSA signature
gives strong evidence of authenticity. Bob performs the
following steps to verify the signature:

1. Reject the signature if it does not satisfy 0 < r < n

and 0 < s < n.

2. Compute w = s−1 mod n and h(m).
3. Compute u1 = h(m)w mod n and u2 = rw mod n.
4. Compute (x, y) = [u1]G + [u2]DA.
5. Accept the signature if and only if x = r mod n

holds.

2.2 Side-Channel Attacks

Thanks to the adoption of ECC and the increasing use of
digital signatures, ECDSA has become a popular algo-
rithm choice for digital signatures. ECDSA’s popularity
makes it a good target for side-channel attacks.

At a high level, an established methodology for EC-
DSA is to query multiple signatures, then partially re-
cover nonces ki from the side-channel, leading to a bound
on the value αti − ui that is shorter than the interval
{1 . . n − 1} for some known integers ti and ui. This leads
to a version of the Hidden Number Problem (HNP) [5]:
recover α given many (ti, ui) pairs. The HNP instances
are then reduced to Closest Vector Problem (CVP) in-
stances, solved with lattice methods.

Over the past decade, several authors have described
practical side-channel attacks on ECDSA that exploit
partial nonce disclosure by different microprocessor fea-
tures to recover long-term private keys.

Brumley and Hakala [6] describe the ﬁrst practical
side-channel attack against OpenSSL’s ECDSA imple-
mentation. They use the EVICT+RELOAD strategy and
an L1 data cache-timing attack to recover the LSBs of
ECDSA nonces from the library’s wNAF (a popular low-
weight signed-digit representation) scalar multiplication
implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.8k. After collecting
2,600 signatures (8K with noise) from the dgst com-
mand line tool and using the Howgrave-Graham and
Smart [15] lattice attack, the authors recover a 160-bit
ECDSA private key from standardized curve secp160r1.
Brumley and Tuveri [7] attack ECDSA with binary
curves in OpenSSL 0.9.8o. Mounting a remote timing at-
tack, the authors show the library’s Montgomery Ladder
scalar multiplication implementation leaks timing infor-
mation on the MSBs of the nonce used and after collect-
ing that information over 8,000 TLS handshakes a 162-
bit NIST B-163 private key can be recovered with lattice
methods.

Benger et al. [4] target OpenSSL’s wNAF implemen-
tation and 256-bit private keys for the standardized GLV
curve [11] secp256k1 used in the BitCoin protocol. Us-
ing as few as 200 ECDSA signatures and the FLUSH+
RELOAD technique [28], the authors ﬁnd some LSBs of
the nonces and extend the lattice technique of [21, 22] to
use a varying amount of leaked bits rather than limiting
to a ﬁxed number.

van de Pol et al. [27] attack OpenSSL’s 1.0.1e wNAF
implementation for the curve secp256k1. Leveraging the
structure of the modulus n, the authors use more infor-
mation leaked in consecutive sequences of bits anywhere
in the top half of the nonces, allowing them to recover
the secret key after observing as few as 25 ECDSA sig-
natures.

Allan et al. [2] improve on previous results by using

a performance-degradation attack to amplify the side-
channel. This ampliﬁcation allows them to additionally
observe the sign bit of digits in the wNAF representa-
tion used in OpenSSL 1.0.2a and to recover secp256k1
private keys after observing only 6 signatures.

Fan et al. [10] increase the information extracted from
each signature by analyzing the wNAF implementation
in OpenSSL. Using the curve secp256k1 as a target, they
perform a successful attack after observing as few as 4
signatures.

Our work differs from previous ECDSA side-channel
attacks in two important ways. (1) We focus on NIST
standard curve P-256, featured in ubiquitous security
standards such as TLS and SSH. Later in Section 2.5,
we explain the reason previous works were unable to tar-
get this extremely relevant curve. (2) We do not target
the scalar-by-point multiplication operation (i.e. the bot-
tleneck of the signing algorithm), but instead Step 3 of
the signing algorithm, the modular inversion operation.

2.3 The FLUSH+RELOAD Attack

The FLUSH+RELOAD technique is a cache-based side-
channel attack technique targeting the Last-Level Cache
(LLC) and used during our attack. FLUSH+RELOAD is
a high resolution, high accuracy and high signal-to-noise
ratio technique that positively identiﬁes accesses to spe-
ciﬁc memory lines. It relies on cache sharing between
processes, typically achieved through the use of shared
libraries or page de-duplication.

Input: Memory Address addr.
Result: True if the victim accessed the address.

begin

flush(addr)
Wait for the victim.
time ← current time()
tmp ← read(addr)
readTime ← current time() - time
return readTime < threshold

Figure 1: FLUSH+RELOAD Attack

A round of attack, depicted in Figure 1, consists of
three phases: (1) The attacker evicts the target memory
line from the cache. (2) The attacker waits some time
so the victim has an opportunity to access the memory
line. (3) The attacker measures the time it takes to reload
the memory line. The latency measured in the last step
tells whether or not the memory line was accessed by the
victim during the second step of the attack, i.e. identiﬁes
cache-hits and cache-misses.

The FLUSH+RELOAD attack technique tries
to
achieve the best resolution possible while keeping the

error rate low. Typically, an attacker encounters multi-
ple challenges due to several processor optimizations and
different architectures. See [2, 24, 28] for discussions of
these challenges.

2.4 Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm

The modular inversion operation is one of the most ba-
sic and essential operations required in public key cryp-
tography. Its correct implementation and constant-time
execution has been a recurrent topic of research [1, 3, 8].
A well known algorithm used for modular inversion
is the Euclidean Extended Algorithm and in practice
is often substituted by a variant called the Binary Ex-
tended Euclidean Algorithm (BEEA) [18, Chap. 14.4.3].
This variant replaces costly division operations by simple
right-shift operations, thus, achieving performance ben-
eﬁts over the regular version of the algorithm. BEEA is
particularly efﬁcient for very long integers—e.g. RSA,
DSA, and ECDSA operands.

Input: Integers k and p such that gcd(k, p) = 1.
Output: k−1 mod p.
v ← p, u ← k, X ← 1, Y ← 0
while u (cid:54)= 0 do

while even(u) do
u ← u/2
if odd(X) then X ← X + p
X ← X/2

while even(v) do
v ← v/2
if odd(Y ) then Y ← Y + p
Y ← Y /2

/* u loop */

/* v loop */

if u ≥ v then
u ← u − v
X ← X −Y

else

v ← v − u
Y ← Y − X

return Y mod p

Figure 2: Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Figure 2 shows the BEEA. Note that in each iteration
only one u or v while-loop is executed, but not both. Ad-
ditionally, in the very ﬁrst iteration only the u while-loop
can be executed since v is a copy of p which is a large
prime integer n for ECDSA.

In 2007, independent research done by Aciic¸mez et al.
[1], Aravamuthan and Thumparthy [3] demonstrated
side-channel attacks against the BEEA. Aravamuthan
and Thumparthy [3] attacked BEEA using Power Anal-
ysis attacks, whereas Aciic¸mez et al. [1] attacked BEEA

through Simple Branch Prediction Analysis (SBPA),
demonstrating the fragility of this algorithm against side-
channel attacks.

Both previous works reach the conclusion that in order
to reveal the value of the nonce k, it is necessary to iden-
tify four critical input-dependent branches leaking infor-
mation, namely:

1. Number of right-shift operations performed on v.
2. Number of right-shift operations performed on u.
3. Number and order of subtractions u := u − v.
4. Number and order of subtractions v := v − u.

Moreover, both works present a BEEA reconstruction
algorithm that allows them to fully recover the nonce
k—and therefore the secret signing key—given a per-
fect side-channel trace that distinguish the four critical
branches.

Aravamuthan and Thumparthy [3] argue that a coun-
termeasure to secure BEEA against side-channel attacks
is to render u and v subtraction branches indistinguish-
able, thus the attack is computationally expensive to
carry out. As a response, Cabrera Aldaya et al. [8]
demonstrated a Simple Power Analysis (SPA) attack
against a custom implementation of the BEEA. The au-
thors’ main contribution consists of demonstrating it is
possible to partially determine the order of subtractions
on branches u and v only by knowing the number of
right-shift operations performed in every while-loop it-
eration. Under a perfect SPA trace, the authors use an
algebraic algorithm to determine a short execution se-
quence of u and v subtraction branches.

They manage to recover various bits of information
for several ECDSA key sizes. The authors are able to
recover information only from some but not all of their
SPA traces by using their algorithm and the partial infor-
mation about right-shift and subtraction operations. Fi-
nally, using a lattice attack they recover the secret signing
key.

As can be seen from the previous works, depending on
the identiﬁable branches in the trace and quality of the
trace it is possible to recover full or partial information
about the nonce k. Unfortunately, the information leaked
by most of the real world side-channels does not allow
us to differentiate between subtraction branches u and v,
therefore limiting the leaked information to three input-
dependent branches:

1. Number of right-shift operations performed on v.
2. Number of right-shift operations performed on u.
3. Number of subtractions.

2.5 OpenSSL History

OpenSSL has a rich and storied history as a prime se-
curity attack target [19], a distinction ascribed to the li-

brary’s ubiquitous real world application. One of the
main contributions of our work is identifying a new
OpenSSL vulnerability described later in Section 3. To
understand the nature of this vulnerability and facili-
tate root cause analysis, in this section we give a brief
overview of side-channel defenses in the OpenSSL li-
brary, along with some context and insight into what
prompted these code changes. Table 1 summarizes the
discussion.
0.9.7. Side-channel considerations started to induce code
changes in OpenSSL starting with the 0.9.7 branch. The
RSA cache-timing attack by Percival [23] recovered se-
cret exponent bits used as lookup table indices in slid-
ing window exponentiation using an EVICT+RELOAD
strategy on HyperThreading architectures. His work
prompted introduction of the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag,
with the intention of allowing special security treatment
of BIGNUMs having said ﬂag set. At the time—and ar-
guably still—the most important use case of the ﬂag is
modular exponentiation. Introduced alongside the ﬂag,
the BN mod exp mont consttime function is a ﬁxed-
window modular exponentiation algorithm featuring data
cache-timing countermeasures. Recent research brings
the security of this solution into question [29].
0.9.8. The work by Aciic¸mez et al. [1] targeting BEEA
prompted the introduction of the BN mod inverse no -
branch function, an implementation with more favor-
able side-channel properties than that of BEEA. The
implementation computes modular inversions in a way
that resembles the classical extended Euclidean algo-
rithm, calculating quotients and remainders in each step
by calling BN div updated to respect the BN FLG CON-
STTIME ﬂag. Tracking callers to BN mod inverse, the
commit1 enables the BN FLG CONSTTIME across several
cryptosystems where the modular inversion inputs were
deemed security critical, notably the published attack tar-
geting RSA.
1.0.1. Based on the work by K¨asper [16], the 1.0.1
branch introduced constant-time scalar multiplication
implementations for several popular elliptic curves. This
code change was arguably motivated by the data cache-
timing attack of Brumley and Hakala [6] against Open-
SSL that recovered digits of many ECDSA nonces dur-
ing scalar multiplication on HyperThreading architec-
tures using the EVICT+RELOAD strategy. This informa-
tion was then used to construct a lattice problem and cal-
culate ECDSA private keys. The commit2 included sev-
eral new EC METHOD implementations, of which arguably
EC GFp nistp256 method has the most real world ap-
plication to date. This new scalar multiplication imple-

sions. Although BN mod exp mont consttime was in-
troduced in the 0.9.7 branch, here we are referring to its
use for modular inversion via FLT.

mentation uses ﬁxed-window combing combined with
secure table lookups via software multiplexing (mask-
ing), and is enabled with the ec nistp 64 gcc 128 op-
tion at build time. For example, Debian 8.0 “Jessie” (cur-
rent LTS, not EOL) and 7.0 “Wheezy” (previous LTS,
not EOL) and Ubuntu 14.04 “Trusty” (previous LTS, not
EOL) enable said option when possible for their Open-
SSL 1.0.1 package builds. From the side-channel attack
perspective, we note that this change is the reason aca-
demic research (see Section 2.2) shifted to the secp256k1
curve—NIST P-256 no longer takes the generic wNAF
scalar multiplication code path like secp256k1.
1.0.2. Motivated by performance and the potential to
utilize Intel AVX extensions, a contribution by Gueron
and Krasnov [14] included fast and secure curve P-
256 operations with their custom EC GFp nistz256 -
method. Here we focus on a cherry picked commit3
that affected the ECDSA sign code path for all elliptic
curves. While speed motivated the contribution, M¨oller
observes4: “It seems that the BN MONT CTX-related code
(used in crypto/ecdsa for constant-time signing) is en-
tirely independent of the remainder of the patch, and
should be considered separately.” Gueron conﬁrms:
“The optimization made for the computation of the mod-
ular inverse in the ECDSA sign, is using const-time mod-
exp. Indeed, this is independent of the rest of the patch,
and it can be used independently (for other usages of
the library). We included this addition in the patch for
the particular usage in ECDSA.” Hence following this
code change, ECDSA signing for all curves now com-
pute modular inversion via BN mod exp mont const-
time and Fermat’s Little Theorem (FLT).

3 A New Vulnerability

From Table 1, starting with 1.0.1 the reasonable expec-
tation is that cryptosystems utilizing P-256 resist timing
attacks, whether they be remote, data cache, instruction

cache, or branch predictor timings. We focus here on
the combination of ECDSA and P-256 within the library.
The reason this is a reasonable expectation is that ec -
nistp 64 gcc 128 provides constant-time scalar multi-
plication to protect secret scalar nonces, and BN mod in-
verse no branch provides microarchitecture attack de-
fenses when inverting these nonces. For ECDSA, these
are the two most critical locations where the secret nonce
is an operand—to produce r and s, respectively.

Paired with this code change,

The vulnerability we now disclose stems from the
changes introduced in the 0.9.8 branch. The BN mod -
inverse function was modiﬁed to ﬁrst check the BN -
FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag of the BIGNUM operands—if set,
the function then early exits to BN mod inverse no -
branch to protect the security-sensitive inputs.
If the
ﬂag is not set, i.e. inputs are not secret, the control ﬂow
continues to the stock BEEA implementation.
the next

task was
to identify callers to BN mod inverse within the li-
brary, and enable the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag for
BIGNUMs in cryptosystem implementations that are
security-sensitive. Our analysis suggests this was done
by searching the code base for uses of the BN FLG EXP -
CONSTTIME ﬂag that was replaced with BN FLG CONST-
TIME as part of the changeset, given the evolution of
constant-time as concept within OpenSSL and no longer
limited to modular exponentiation. As a result, the code
changes permeated RSA, DSA, and Difﬁe-Hellman im-
plementations, but not ECC-based cryptosystems such as
ECDH and ECDSA.

This leaves a gap for 1.0.1 with respect

to EC-
DSA. While ec nistp 64 gcc 128 provides constant-
time scalar multiplication to compute the r component
of P-256 ECDSA signatures, the s component will com-
pute modular inverses of security-critical nonces with
the stock BN mod inverse function, not taking the BN -
mod inverse no branch code path. In the end, the root
cause is that the ECDSA signing implementation does
not set the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag for nonces. Scalar
multiplication with ec nistp 64 gcc 128 is oblivious
to this ﬂag and always treats single scalar inputs as
security-sensitive, yet BN mod inverse requires said
ﬂag to take the new secure code path.

Figure 3 illustrates this vulnerability running in Open-
SSL 1.0.1u. The caller function ecdsa sign setup
contains the bulk of the ECDSA signing cryptosystem—
generating a nonce, computing the scalar multiple, in-
verting the nonce, computing r, and so on. When control
ﬂow reaches callee BN mod inverse, inputs a and n are
the nonce and generator order, respectively. Stepping by
instruction, it shows that the call to BN mod inverse -
no branch never takes place, since the BN FLG CONST-
TIME ﬂag is not set for either of these operands. Failing
this security critical branch, the control ﬂow continues to

3.1 Forks

OpenSSL is not the only software library affected by this
vulnerability. Following HeartBleed, OpenBSD forked
OpenSSL to LibreSSL in July 2014, and Google forked
OpenSSL to BoringSSL in June 2014. We now discuss
this vulnerability within the context of these two forks.
LibreSSL. An 04 Nov 2016 commit5 cherry picked the
EC GFp nistz256 method for LibreSSL. Interestingly,
LibreSSL is the library most severely affected by this
vulnerability. The reason is they did not cherry pick
the BN mod exp mont consttime ECDSA nonce in-
version. That is, as of this writing (ﬁxed during dis-
closure) the current LibreSSL master branch can fea-
ture constant-time P-256 scalar multiplication with ei-
ther EC GFp nistz256 method or EC GFp nistp256 -
method callees depending on compile-time options and
minor code changes, but inverts all ECDSA nonces with

the BN mod inverse callee that fails the same security
critical branch as OpenSSL, due to the caller ecdsa -
sign setup not setting the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag for
ECDSA signing nonces. We conﬁrmed the vulnerability
using a LibreSSL build with debug symbols, checking
the inversion code path with a debugger.
BoringSSL. An 03 Nov 2015 commit6 picked up
the EC GFp nistz256 method implementation for Bor-
ingSSL. That commit also included the BN mod exp -
mont consttime ECDSA nonce inversion callee, which
OpenSSL cherry picked. The parent tree7 is slightly
older on the same day. Said tree features constant-
time P-256 scalar multiplication with callee EC GFp -
nistp256 method, but inverts ECDSA signing nonces
with callee BN mod inverse that fails the same security
critical branch, again due to the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag
not being set by the caller—i.e. it follows essentially the
same code path as OpenSSL. We veriﬁed the vulnerabil-
ity affects said tree using a debugger.

4 Exploiting the Vulnerability

Exploiting the vulnerability and performing our cache-
timing attack is a long and complex process, therefore
the analysis details are decomposed in several subsec-
tions. Section 4.1 discusses the hardware and software
setup used during our experimentation phase. Section 4.2
analyzes and describes the sources of leakage in Open-
SSL and the exploitation techniques. Section 4.3 and
Section 4.4 describe in detail our improvements on the
performance degradation technique and key recovery, re-
spectively. Figure 4 gives an overview of the attack sce-
nario followed during our experiments.

4.1 Attack Setup

Our attack setup consists of an Intel Core i5-2400 Sandy
Bridge 3.10GHz (32 nm) with 8GB of memory running
64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 LTS “Xenial”. Each CPU core has
an 8-way 32KB L1 data cache, an 8-way 32KB L1 in-
struction cache, an 8-way 256KB L2 uniﬁed cache, and
all the cores share a 12-way 6MB uniﬁed LLC (all with
64B cache lines). It does not feature HyperThreading.

We built OpenSSL 1.0.1u with debugging symbols
on the executable. Debugging symbols facilitate map-
ping source code to memory addresses, serving a dou-
ble purpose to us: (1) Improving our degrading attack
(see Section 4.3); (2) Probing the sequence of opera-
tions accurately. Note that debugging symbols are not

loaded during run time, thus not affecting victim’s per-
formance. Attackers can map source code to memory
addresses by using reverse engineering techniques [9] if
debugging symbols are not available. We set enable-
ec nistp 64 gcc 128 and shared as conﬁguration op-
tions at build time to ensure faster execution, constant-
time scalar multiplication and compile OpenSSL as a
shared object.

4.2 Source of Leakage

As seen in the Figure 3 backtrace, when performing an
ECDSA digital signature, OpenSSL calls ecdsa sign -
setup to prepare the required parameters and compute
most of the actual signature. The random nonce k is cre-
ated and to avoid possible timing attacks [7] an equiva-
lent ﬁxed bit-length nonce is computed. The length of
the equivalent nonce ˆk is ﬁxed to one bit more than that
of the group’s prime order n, thus the equivalent nonce
satisﬁes ˆk = k + γ · n where γ ∈ {1, 2}.

Additionally, ecdsa sign setup computes the sig-
nature’s r using a scalar multiplication function pointer
wrapper (i.e. for P-256, traversing the constant-time code
path instead of generic wNAF) followed by the modular
inverse k−1, needed for the s component of the signa-
ture. To compute the inversion, it calls BN mod inverse,
where the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag is checked but due
to the vulnerability discussed in Section 3 the condition
fails, therefore proceeding to compute k−1 using the clas-
sical BEEA.

Note that before executing the BEEA, the equivalent
nonce ˆk is unpadded through a modular reduction oper-
ation, resulting in the original nonce k and voiding the
ﬁxed bit-length countermeasure applied shortly before
by ecdsa sign setup.

The goal of our attack is to accurately trace and re-

cover side-channel information leaked from the BEEA
execution, allowing us to construct the sequence of right-
shift and subtraction operations. To that end, we identify
the routines used in the BN mod inverse method leak-
ing side-channel information.

The BN mod inverse method operates with very
large integers, therefore it uses several speciﬁc routines
to perform basic operations with BIGNUMs. Addition
operations call the routine BN uadd, which is a wrapper
for bn add words—assembly code performing the ac-
tual addition. Two different routines are called to per-
form right-shift operations. The BN rshift1 routine
performs a single right-shift by one bit position, used on
X and Y in their respective loops. The BN rshift rou-
tine receives the number of bit positions to shift right as
an argument, used on u and v at the end of their respec-
tive loops. OpenSSL keeps a counter for the shift count,
and the loop conditions test u and v bit values at this off-
set. This is an optimization allowing u and v to be right-
shifted all at once in a single call instead of iteratively.
Additionally, subtraction is achieved through the use of
the BN usub routine, which is a pure C implementation.
Similar in spirit to previous works [4, 24, 27] that
instead target other functionality within OpenSSL, we
use the FLUSH+RELOAD technique to attack OpenSSL’s
BEEA implementation. As mentioned before in Sec-
tion 2.4, unfortunately the side-channel and the algo-
rithm implementation do not allow us to efﬁciently
probe and distinguish the four critical input-dependent
branches, therefore we are limited to knowing only the
execution of addition, right-shift and subtraction opera-
tions.

After identifying the input-dependent branches in
OpenSSL’s implementation of the BEEA, using the FLU-
SH+RELOAD technique we place probes in code routines
BN rshift1 and BN usub. These two routines provide
the best resolution and combination of probes, allowing
us to identify the critical input-dependent branches.

The modular inversion is an extremely fast operation
and only a small fraction of the entire digital signa-
ture. It is challenging to get good resolution and enough
granularity with the FLUSH+RELOAD technique due to
the speed of the technique itself, therefore, we apply a
variation of the performance degradation attack to slow
down the modular inversion operation by a factor of ~18.
(See Section 4.3.)

Maximizing performance degradation by identifying
the best candidate memory lines gives us the granularity
required for the attack. Combining the FLUSH+RELOAD
technique with a performance degradation attack allows
us to determine the number of right-shift operations exe-
cuted between subtraction calls by the BEEA. From the
trace, we reconstruct the sequence of right-shift and sub-
traction operations (LS sequence) executed by the BEEA.

Figure 5: Raw traces for the beginning of two BEEA ex-
ecutions. The L probe tracks right-shift latencies and the
S probe tracks subtraction. Latency is in CPU clock cy-
cles. For visualization, focus on the amplitude valleys,
i.e. low latency. Top: LS sequence starting SLLLL cor-
responds to j = 5, (cid:96)i = 4, ai = 1. Bottom: LS sequence
starting LSLLSLS corresponds to j = 7, (cid:96)i = 5, ai = 10.
See Section 4.4 for notation.

As Figure 4 illustrates, our attack scenario exploits
three CPU cores by running a malicious process in every
core and the victim process in the fourth core. The at-
tack consists of a spy process probing the right-shift and
subtraction operations running in parallel with the vic-
tim application. Additionally, two degrading processes
slow down victim’s execution, allowing us to capture the
LS sequence almost perfectly. Unfortunately there is not
always a reliable indicator in the signal for transitions
from one right-shift operation to the next, therefore we
estimate the number of adjacent right-shift operations by
taking into account the latency and the horizontal dis-
tance between subtractions. Figure 5 contains sample
raw traces captured in our test environment.

Our spy process accurately captures all the subtrac-
tion operations but duplicates some right-shift opera-
tions, therefore we focus on the ﬁrst part of the sequence
to recover a variable amount of bits of information from
every trace. (See Section 4.4.)

4.3

Improving Performance Degradation

Performance degradation attacks amplify side-channel
signals, improving the quality and the amount of in-
formation leaked. Our performance degradation attack
improves upon the work of Allan et al. [2].
In their
work, the authors ﬁrst need to identify “hot” memory
addresses, i.e. memory addresses frequently accessed.
They suggest two approaches to ﬁnd suitable memory
lines to degrade. The ﬁrst approach is to read and under-

 100 200 10 20 30 40 50LatencyTimeL probeS probe 100 200 10 20 30 40 50 60LatencyTimeL probeS probestand the victim code in order to identify frequently ac-
cessed code sections such as tight loops. This approach
requires understanding the code, a task that might not al-
ways be possible, takes time and it is prone to errors [26],
therefore the authors propose another option.

The second and novel approach they propose is to au-
tomate code analysis by collecting code coverage infor-
mation using the gcov tool. The code coverage tool out-
puts accessed code lines and then using this information
it is possible for an attacker to locate the memory lines
corresponding to the code lines. Some caveats of this
approach are that source lines can be replicated due to
compiler optimizations, thus the gcov tool might misre-
port the number of memory accesses. Moreover, code
lines containing function calls can be twice as effective
compared to the gcov output. In addition to the caveats
mentioned previously, we note that the gcov proﬁling
tool adds instrumentation to the code. The instrumenta-
tion skews the performance of the program, therefore this
approach is suboptimal since it requires building the tar-
get code twice, one with instrumentation to identify code
lines and other only with debugging symbols to measure
the real performance.

Once the “hot” memory addresses are identiﬁed, the
next step is to evict them from the cache in a tight loop,
thus increasing the execution time of the process access-
ing those addresses. This technique allows to stealthily
degrade a process without alerting the victim, since the
increased execution time is not noticeable by a typical
user. Performance degradation attacks have been used
previously in conjunction with other side-channel attacks
(see e.g. [24]).

We note that it can be difﬁcult and time consuming
to identify the “hot” memory addresses to degrade that
result in the best information leak. To that end, we fol-
low a similar but faster and more quantitative approach,
potentially more accurate since it leverages additional
metrics. Similar to [2] we test the efﬁciency of the at-
tack for several candidate memory lines. We compare
cache-misses between a regular modular inversion and
a degraded modular inversion execution, resulting in a
list of the “hottest” memory lines, building the code only
once with debugging symbols and using hardware regis-
ter counters.

The perf command in Linux offers access to per-
formance counters—CPU hardware registers counting
hardware events (e.g. CPU cycles, instructions executed,
cache-misses and branch mispredictions). We execute
calls to OpenSSL’s modular inverse operation, counting
the number of cache-misses during a regular execution of
the operation. Next, we degrade—by ﬂushing in a loop
from the cache—one memory line at a time from the
caller BN mod inverse and callees BN rshift1, BN -
rshift, BN uadd, bn add words, BN usub.

The perf command output gives us the real count
of cache-misses during the regular execution of BN -
mod inverse, then under degradation of each candidate
memory line. This effectively identiﬁes the “hottest” ad-
dresses during a modular inverse operation with respect
to both the cache and the actual malicious processes we
will use during the attack.

Table 2 summarizes the results over 1, 000 iterations of
a regular modular inversion execution versus the degra-
dation of different candidate memory lines identiﬁed us-
ing our technique. The table shows cache-miss rates
ranging from ~35% (BN rshift and BN usub) to ~172%
(BN rshift1) for one degrading address. Degrading the
overall 6 “hottest” addresses accessed by the BN mod -
inverse function results in an impressive cache-miss
rate of ~1,146%.

Interestingly, the last column of Table 2 reveals the
real impact of cache-misses in the execution time of
the modular inversion operation. Despite the impres-
sive cache-miss rates, the clock cycle slow down is more
modest with a maximum slow down of ~18. These re-
sults suggest that in order to get a quality trace, the goal is
to achieve an increased rate of cache-misses rather than a
CPU clock cycle slow down because whereas the cache-
misses suggest a CPU clock cycle slow down, it is not
the case for the opposite direction.

The effectiveness of the attack varies for each use case
and for each routine called. Some of the routines iter-
ate over internal loops several times (e.g. BN rshift1)
whereas in some other routines, iteration over internal
loops happens few times (e.g. BN usub) or none at all.
Take for example previous “hot” addresses from Ta-
ble 2—degrading the most used address from each rou-
tine does not necessarily give the best result. Overall
“hottest” addresses in Table 2 shows the result of choos-
ing the best strategy for our use case, where the addresses
degraded in every routine varies from multiple addresses
per routine to no addresses at all.

For our use case, we observe the best results with 6
degrading addresses across two degrading processes ex-
ecuting in different CPU cores. Additional addresses do
not provide any additional slow down, instead they im-
pact negatively the FLUSH+RELOAD technique.

4.4

Improving Key Recovery

Arguably the most signiﬁcant contribution of [8] is they
show the LS sequence is sufﬁcient to extract a certain
number of LSBs from nonces, even when it is not known
whether branch u or v gets taken. They give an algebraic
method to recover these LSBs, and utilize these partial
nonce bits in a lattice attack, using the formalization in
[21, 22]. The disadvantage of that approach is that it ﬁxes
the number of known LSBs (denoted (cid:96)) per equation [8,

Sec. 5]: “when a set of signatures are collected such that,
for each of them, [(cid:96)] bits of the nonce are known, a set
of equations . . . can be obtained and the problem of ﬁnd-
ing the private key can be reduced to an instance of the
[HNP].” Fixing (cid:96) impacts their results in two important
ways. First, since their lattice utilizes a ﬁxed (cid:96), they fo-
cus on the ability to algebraically recover only a ﬁxed
number of bits from the LS sequence. From [8, Tbl. 1],
our target implementation is similar to their “Standard-
M0” target, and they focus on (cid:96) ∈ {8, 12, 16, 20}. For
example, to extract (cid:96) = 8 LSBs they need to query on
average 4 signatures, discarding all remaining signatures
that do not satisfy (cid:96) ≥ 8. Second, this directly inﬂuences
the number of signatures needed in the lattice phase.
From [8, Tbl. 2-3], for 256-bit n and (cid:96) = 8, they re-
quire 168 signatures. This is because they are discard-
ing three out of four signatures on average where (cid:96) < 8,
then go on to construct a d + 1-dimension lattice where
d = 168/4 = 42 from the signatures that meet the (cid:96) ≥ 8
restriction. The metric of interest from the attacker per-
spective is the number of required signatures.

In this section, we improve with respect

to both
points—extracting a varying number of bits from every
nonce, subsequently allowing our lattice problem to uti-
lize every signature queried, resulting in a signiﬁcantly
reduced number of required signatures.
Extracting nonce bits. Rather than focusing on the aver-
age number of required signatures as a function of a num-
ber of target LSBs, our approach is to examine the aver-
age number of bits extracted as a function of LS sequence
length. We empirically measured this quantity by gener-
ating βi uniformly at random from {1 . . n − 1} for P-256
n, running the BEEA on βi and n to obtain the ground
truth LS sequence, and taking the ﬁrst j operations from
this sequence. We then grouped the βi by these length- j
subsequence values, and ﬁnally determined the maximal
shared LSBs value of each group. Intuitively, this maps
any length- j subsequence to a known LSBs value. For
example, a sequence beginning LLS has j = 3, (cid:96) = 3,

a = 4 interpreted as a length-3 subsequence that leaks 3
LSBs with a value of 4.

We performed 226 trials (i.e. 1 ≤ i ≤ 226) for each
length 1 ≤ j ≤ 16 independently and Figure 6 contains
the results (see Table 6 in the appendix for the raw data).
Naturally as the length of the sequence grows, we are
able to extract more bits. But at the same time, in real-
ity for practical side-channels longer sequences are more
likely to contain trace errors (i.e. incorrectly inferred
LS sequences), ultimately leading to nonsensical lattice
problems for key recovery. So we are looking for the
right balance between these two factors. Figure 6 allows
us to draw several conclusions, including but not limited
to: (1) Sequences of length 5 or more allow us to ex-
tract a minimum of 3 nonce bits per signature; (2) Sim-
ilarly length 7 or more for a minimum of 4 nonce bits;
(3) The average number of bits extracted grows rapidly
at ﬁrst, then the growth slows as the sequence length in-
creases. This observation pairs nicely with the nature
of side-channels: attempting to target longer sequences
(risking trace errors) only marginally increases the aver-
age number of bits extracted. From the lattice perspec-
tive, (cid:96) ≥ 3 is a practical requirement [21, Sec. 4.2] so
in that respect sequences of length 5 is the minimum to
guarantee that every signature can be used as an equation
for the lattice problem.

To summarize, the data used to produce Figure 6 al-
lows us to essentially build a dictionary that maps LS
sequences of a given length to an ((cid:96)i, ai) pair, which we
now deﬁne and utilize.
Recovering private keys. We follow the formalization
of [21, 22] with the use of per-equation (cid:96)i due to [4,
Sec. 4]. Extracted from our side-channel, we are left with
equations ki = 2(cid:96)ibi + ai where (cid:96)i and ai are known, and
since 0 < ki < n it follows that 0 ≤ bi ≤ n/2(cid:96)i. Denote
(cid:98)x(cid:99)n modular reduction of x to the interval {0 . . n − 1}
and |x|n to the interval {−(n − 1)/2 . . (n − 1)/2}. Deﬁne
the following (attacker-known) values.

ti = (cid:98)ri/(2(cid:96)isi)(cid:99)n
ˆui = (cid:98)(ai − hi/si)/2(cid:96)i(cid:99)n

It now follows that 0 ≤ (cid:98)αti − ˆui(cid:99)n < n/2(cid:96)i. Setting

ui = ˆui + n/2(cid:96)i+1, we obtain
vi = |αti − ui|n ≤ n/2(cid:96)i+1,

i.e. integers λi exist such that |αti − ui − λin| ≤ n/2(cid:96)i+1
holds. The ui approximate αti since they are closer than
a uniformly random value from {1 . . n − 1}, leading to
an instance of the HNP [5]: recover α given many (ti, ui)
pairs.

Consider the rational d + 1-dimension lattice gener-

revealing α. To extend the search space, we use the ran-
domization technique inspired by Gama et al. [12, Sec.
5], shufﬂing the order of ti and ui and multiplying by a
random sparse unimodular matrix between lattice reduc-
tions.
Empirical results. Table 3 contains our empirical re-
sults for various lattice parameters targeting P-256. As
part of our experiments, we were able to successfully
reproduce and verify the (cid:96) ∈ {8, 12}, lg n ≈ 256 lattice
results of Cabrera Aldaya et al. [8] in our environment
for comparison. While the goal is to minimize the num-
ber of required signatures, this should be weighed with
observed HNP success probability, affecting search dura-
tion. From Figure 6 we focus on LS subsequence lengths
j ∈ {5, 7} that yield (cid:96)i nonce LSBs from ranges {3 . . 5}
and {4 . . 7}, respectively. Again this is in contrast to [8]
that ﬁxes (cid:96) and discards signatures—this is the reason
their signature count is much higher than the d + 2 lattice
dimension in their case, but equal in ours.

A relevant metric affecting success probability is the
total number of known nonce bits for each HNP instance.
Naturally as this sum approaches lg n one expects correct
solutions to start emerging. On the other hand, increas-
ing this sum demands querying more signatures, at the
same time increasing d and lattice methods become less
precise. For a given HNP instance, denote l = ∑d
i=1 (cid:96)i, i.e.
the total number of known nonce bits over all the equa-
tions for the particular HNP instance. Table 3 denotes µl
the mean value of l over all successful HNP instances—
intuitively tracking how many known nonce bits needed
in total to reasonably expect success.

We ran 200 independent trials for each set of param-
eters on a computing cluster with Intel Xeon X5650
nodes. We allowed each trial to execute at most four
hours, and we say successful trials are those HNP in-
stances recovering the private key within this allotted
time. Our lattice implementation uses Sage software
with BKZ [25] reduction, block size 30.

To summarize, utilizing every signature in our HNP
instances leads to a signiﬁcant improvement over previ-
ous work with respect to both the number of required
signatures and amount of side-channel data required.

5 Attacking Applications

OpenSSL is a shared library and therefore any vulnera-
bility present in it can potentially be exploited from any
application linked against it. This is the case for the
present work and to demonstrate the feasibility of our
attack in a concrete real-life scenario, we focus on two
applications implementing two ubiquitous security pro-
tocols: TLS within stunnel and SSH within OpenSSH.

OpenSSL provides ECDSA functionality for both ap-
plications and therefore we mount our attack against

ous sequence lengths. Each sequence length consisted of
226 trials, over which we calculated the mean (with de-
viation), maximum, and minimum number of recovered
LSBs. Error bars are one standard deviation on each side.

OpenSSL’s ECDSA running within them. More pre-
cisely, this section describes the tools and the setup fol-
lowed to successfully exploit the vulnerability within
these applications. In addition, we explain the relevant
messages collected for each application, later used for
private key recovery together with the trace data and the
signatures.

5.1 TLS

Stunnel8 is a popular portable open source software ap-
plication that forwards network connections from one
port to another and provides a TLS wrapper. Network ap-
plications that do not natively support TLS communica-
tion beneﬁt from the use of stunnel. More precisely, stun-
nel can be used to provide a TLS connection between a
public port exposing a TLS-enabled network service and
a localhost port providing a non-TLS network service. It
links against OpenSSL to provide TLS functionality.

For our experiments, we used stunnel 5.39 compiled
from stock source and linked against OpenSSL 1.0.1u.
We generated a P-256 ECDSA certiﬁcate for the stunnel
service and chose the ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA TLS
1.2 cipher suite.

In order to collect digital signature and digest tuples,
we wrote a custom TLS client that connects to the stun-
nel service. Our TLS client initiates TLS connections,
collects the protocol messages and continues the hand-
shake until it receives the ServerHelloDone message,
then it drops the connection. The protocol messages
contain relevant information for the attack. The Clien-
tHello and ServeHello messages contain each a 32-
byte random ﬁeld, in practice these bytes represent a
4-byte UNIX timestamp concatenated with a 28-byte
nonce. The Certificate message contains the P-256

ECDSA certiﬁcate generated for the stunnel service. The
ServerKeyExchange message contains ECDH key ex-
change parameters including the curve type (named -
curve), the curve name (secp256r1) and the Signa-
tureHashAlgorithm. Finally, the digital signature it-
self is sent as part of the ServerKeyExchange message.
The ECDSA signature is over the concatenated string

ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random +
ServerKeyExchange.params

and the hash function is SHA-512, proposed by the client
in the ClientHello message and accepted by the server
in the SignatureHashAlgorithm ﬁeld (explicit values
0x06, 0x03). Our TLS client saves the hash of the con-
catenated string and the DER-encoded ECDSA signature
sent by the server.

In order to achieve synchronization between the spy
and the victim processes, our spy process is launched
prior to the TLS handshakes, therefore it collects the
trace for each ECDSA signature performed during the
handshakes, then it stops when the ServerHelloDone
message is received. The process is repeated as needed
to build up a set of distinct trace, digital signature, and
digest tuples. Section 5.3 contains accuracy results for
several LS subsequence patterns for an stunnel victim.

5.2 SSH

OpenSSH9 is a widely used open source software suite to
provide secure communication over an insecure channel.
OpenSSH is a set of tools implementing the SSH net-
work protocol and it is typically linked against OpenSSL
to perform several cryptographic operations, including
digital signatures (excluding ed25519 signatures) and
key exchange.

For our experiments, we used OpenSSH 7.4p1 com-
piled from stock source and linked against OpenSSL
1.0.1u. The ECDSA key pair used by the server and tar-
geted by our attack is the default P-256 key pair gener-
ated during installation of OpenSSH.

Following a similar approach to Section 5.1, we wrote
a custom SSH client that connects to the OpenSSH server
to collect digital signatures and digest tuples. At the
same time, our spy process running on the server side
collects the timing signals leaked by the server during
the handshake.

Relevant to this work, the OpenSSH server was con-
ﬁgured with the ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 host key al-
gorithm and the default P-256 key pair. After the ini-
tial ClientVersion and ServerVersion messages, the
protocol deﬁnes the Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange pa-
rameters, the signature algorithm and the hash function

the trace for each ECDSA signature performed during
the handshakes. All the protocol messages starting from
SSH MSG NEWKEYS and any client responses are not re-
quired by our attack, therefore the client drops the con-
nection and repeats the process as needed to build up a
set of distinct trace, digital signature, and digest tuples.
Section 5.3 contains accuracy results for several LS sub-
sequence patterns for an SSH server victim.

5.3 Attack Results

Procurement accuracy. Table 4 and Table 5 show the
empirical accuracy results for patterns of length j = 5
and j = 7, respectively. These patterns represent the
beginning of the LS sequence in the context of Open-
SSL ECDSA executing in real world applications (TLS
via stunnel, SSH via OpenSSH). From our empirical
(1) Similar to previous
results we note three trends:
works [4, 24, 27], the accuracy of the subsequence de-
creases as (cid:96) increases due to the deviation in the right-
shift operation width. (2) The accuracy also decreases for
subsequences containing several contiguous right-shift
operations, e.g. ﬁrst and last rows, due to the variable
width of right-shift operations within a single trace. (3)
SSH traces are slightly noisier than TLS traces; we spec-
ulate this is due to the computation of the ECDH shared
secret prior to the ECDSA signature itself. Using our
improved degradation technique (Section 4.3) we can re-
cover a with very high probability, despite the speed of
the modular inversion operation and the imperfect traces.
Key recovery. We close with a few data points
for our end-to-end attack, here focusing on TLS. In
this context, end-to-end means all steps from the at-
tacker perspective—i.e. launching the degrade processes,

launching the spy process, and launching our custom
TLS client. Finally, repeating these steps to gather mul-
tiple trace and signature pairs, then running the lattice
attack for key recovery. That is, no steps in the attack
chain are abstracted away.

The experiments for Table 3 assume perfect traces.
However, as seen in Table 4 and Table 5, while we ob-
serve quite high accuracy, in our environment we are un-
able to realize absolutely perfect traces. Trace errors will
occur, and lattice methods have no recourse to compen-
sate for them. We resort to oversampling and randomized
brute force search to achieve key recovery in practice.

For the j = 5 case, we procured 150 signatures with

(potentially imperfect) trace data. Consulting Table 3,
we took 400 random subsets of size 80 from this set
and ran lattice attack instances on a computing cluster.
The ﬁrst instance to succeed in recovering the private
key did so in roughly 8 minutes. Checking the ground
truth afterwards, 142 of these original 150 traces were
correct, i.e. ~0.18% of all possible subsets are error-free.
This successful attack is consistent with the probability
1 − (1 − 0.0018)400 ≈ 51.4%.

Similarly for the j = 7 case, we procured 150 signa-
tures with (potentially imperfect) trace data. Consulting
Table 3, we took 400 random subsets of size 55 from this
set and ran lattice attack instances on a computing clus-
ter. The ﬁrst instance to succeed in recovering the private
key did so in under a minute. Checking the ground truth
afterwards, 137 of these original 150 traces were correct,
i.e. ~0.19% of all possible subsets are error-free. This
successful attack is also consistent with the probability
1 − (1 − 0.0019)400 ≈ 53.3%.

It is worth noting that with this na¨ıve strategy,
it
is always possible to trade signatures for more ofﬂine
search effort. Moreover, it is possible to traverse the
search space by weighting trace data subsets according
to known pattern accuracy, e.g. explore patterns with ac-
curacy ≥ 95% sooner.

6 Conclusion

In this work, we disclose a new vulnerability in widely-
deployed software libraries that causes ECDSA nonce
inversions to be computed with the BEEA instead of a
code path with microarchitecture attack mitigations. We
design and demonstrate a practical cache-timing attack
against this insecure code path, leveraging our new per-
formance degradation metric. Combined with our im-
proved nonce bits recovery approach and lattice parame-
terization, this enable us to recover P-256 ECDSA pri-
vate keys from OpenSSL despite constant-time scalar
multiplication. As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst
cache-timing attack targeting nonce inversion in Open-
SSL, and furthermore the ﬁrst side-channel attack against
cryptosystems leveraging its constant-time P-256 scalar
multiplication methods. Our contributions traverse both
practice and theory, recovering keys with as few as 50
signatures and corresponding traces.

Stepping back from the concrete side-channel attack
we realized here, our improved nonce bit recovery ap-
proach coupled with tuned lattice parameters demon-
strates that even small leaks of BEEA execution can have
disastrous consequences. Observing as few as the ﬁrst 5
operations in the LS sequence allows every signature to
be used as an equation for the lattice problem. Moreover,
our work highlights the fact that constant-time consider-
ations are ultimately about the software stack, and not

necessarily a single component in isolation.

The rapid development of cache-timing attacks paired
with the need for fast solutions and mitigations led to
the inclusion of the BN FLG CONSTTIME ﬂag in Open-
SSL. Over the years, the ﬂag proved to be useful when
introducing new constant-time implementations, but un-
fortunately its usage is now beyond OpenSSL’s original
design. As new cache-timing attacks emerged, the us-
age of the ﬂag increased throughout the library. At the
same time the programming error probability increased,
and many of those errors permeated to forks such as
LibreSSL and BoringSSL. The recent exploitation sur-
rounding the ﬂag’s usage, this work included, highlights
it as a prime example of why failing securely is a fun-
damental concept in security by design. For example,
P-256 takes the constant-time scalar multiplication code
path by default, oblivious to the ﬂag, while in stark con-
trast modular inversion relies critically on this ﬂag being
set to follow the code path with microarchitecture attack
mitigations.

Following responsible disclosure procedures, we re-
ported the issue to the developers of the affected products
after our ﬁndings. We lifted the embargo in December
2016. Despite OpenSSL’s 1.0.1 branch being a standard
package shipped with popular Linux distributions such
as Ubuntu (12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS), Debian (7.0 and
8.0), and SUSE, it reached EOL in January 2017. Back-
porting security ﬁxes to EOL packages is a necessary and
challenging task, and to contribute we provide a patch to
mitigate our attack. OpenSSL assigned CVE-2016-7056
based on our work. See the appendix for the patch.

# CVE-2016-7056 ECDSA P-256 timing attack key recovery (OpenSSL, LibreSSL, BoringSSL)

---

*From*: Cesar Pereida Garcia <cesar.pereidagarcia () tut fi>

*Date*: Tue, 10 Jan 2017 15:50:28 +0000

```
Attack Vector: Local

Vendor: OpenSSL, LibreSSL, BoringSSL

Versions Affected:
OpenSSL 1.0.1u and previous versions
LibreSSL (pre 6.0 errata 16, pre 5.9 errata 33)
BoringSSL pre November 2015

Description:
The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks
is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic
curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion.
A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing
to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting
in a cache-timing attack vulnerability.
A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.

Mitigation:
Users of OpenSSL with the affected versions should apply
the patch available in the manuscript at [1].

Users of LibreSSL should apply the official patch from OpenBSD [2,3].

Users of BoringSSL should upgrade to a more recent version.

## Details

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when

performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as other

releases were fixed in a previous security update. ([CVE-2016-2177](/security/CVE-2016-2177))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle Montgomery

multiplication, resulting in incorrect results leading to transient

failures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10.

([CVE-2016-7055](/security/CVE-2016-7055))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time

operations when performing ECDSA P-256 signing. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover private

ECDSA keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. ([CVE-2016-7056](/security/CVE-2016-7056))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain warning alerts.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to stop

responding, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-8610](/security/CVE-2016-8610))

Robert Święcki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain

truncated packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-3731](/security/CVE-2017-3731))

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86\_64 Montgomery

squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to recover private keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04

LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2017-3732](/security/CVE-2017-3732))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 10:09:24 UTC  ``` The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.

Sidhpurwala    2017-01-12 08:41:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to be have local (shell) access to the machine where the message is being signed using the ECDSA algorithm with a P-256 elliptic curve key. Then using cache timing attacks (which needs precise timing), on multiple signature runs, the private key could be obtained. Based on the factor that exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security Team has rated this flaw as having Moderate impact. A further security release may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:46:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Via RHSA-2017:1415 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1415](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1415)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 17:57:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2017:1414 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1414](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1414)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-06-07 18:00:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2017:1413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1413)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c16)  Huzaifa S.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](#c0)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-01-11 21:51:23 UTC  ``` The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.   References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/52> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1195> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2018-01-21 02:36:53 UTC  ``` All dependent bugs closed. ``` |  |

RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

Issued:

Updated:
2017-06-07
# RHSA-2017:1415 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

#### Paper 2016/1195

### Constant-Time Callees with Variable-Time Callers

Cesar Pereida Garcïa and Billy Bob Brumley

##### Abstract

Side-channel attacks are a serious threat to security-critical software. To mitigate remote timing and cache-timing attacks, many ubiquitous cryptography software libraries feature constant-time implementations of cryptographic primitives. In this work, we disclose a vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.0.1u that recovers ECDSA private keys for the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite the library featuring both constant-time curve operations and modular inversion with microarchitecture attack mitigations. Exploiting this defect, we target
the errant modular inversion code path with a cache-timing and improved
performance degradation attack, recovering the inversion state sequence. We propose a new approach of extracting a variable number of nonce bits from these sequences, and improve upon the best theoretical result to recover private keys in a lattice attack with as few as 50 signatures and corresponding traces. As far as we are aware, this is the first timing attack against OpenSSL ECDSA that does not target scalar multiplication, the first side-channel attack on cryptosystems
leveraging P-256 constant-time scalar multiplication and furthermore, we extend our attack to TLS and SSH protocols, both linked to OpenSSL for P-256 ECDSA signing.

**Note:** As appears in USENIX Security 17

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-7056 CVE-2016-8610 CVE-2017-3731

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL:

CVE-2016-7056

    A local timing attack was discovered against ECDSA P-256.

CVE-2016-8610

    It was discovered that no limit was imposed on alert packets during
    an SSL handshake.

CVE-2017-3731

    Robert Swiecki discovered that the RC4-MD5 cipher when running on
    32 bit systems could be forced into an out-of-bounds read, resulting
    in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1t-1+deb8u6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0d-1 of the openssl source package and in version 1.0.2k-1
of the openssl1.0 source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1413)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Core Services is a set of supplementary software for Red Hat JBoss middleware products. This software, such as Apache HTTP Server, is common to multiple JBoss middleware products, and is packaged under Red Hat JBoss Core Services to allow for faster distribution of updates, and for a more consistent update experience.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23 Service Pack 1 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.23, and includes bug fixes, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS status request extension data during session renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling support. (CVE-2016-6304)
* It was discovered that the mod\_session\_crypto module of httpd did not use any mechanisms to verify integrity of the encrypted session data stored in the user's browser. A remote attacker could use this flaw to decrypt and modify session data using a padding oracle attack. (CVE-2016-0736)
* It was discovered that the mod\_auth\_digest module of httpd did not properly check for memory allocation failures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause httpd child processes to repeatedly crash if the server used HTTP digest authentication. (CVE-2016-2161)
* A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys. (CVE-2016-7056)
* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients. (CVE-2016-8610)
* It was discovered that the HTTP parser in httpd incorrectly allowed certain characters not permitted by the HTTP protocol specification to appear unencoded in HTTP request headers. If httpd was used in conjunction with a proxy or backend server that interpreted those characters differently, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to inject data into HTTP responses, resulting in proxy cache poisoning. (CVE-2016-8743)
* A vulnerability was found in httpd's handling of the LimitRequestFields directive in mod\_http2, affecting servers with HTTP/2 enabled. An attacker could send crafted requests with headers larger than the server's available memory, causing httpd to crash. (CVE-2016-8740)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting CVE-2016-6304 and Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) for reporting CVE-2016-8610. Upstream acknowledges Shi Lei (Gear Team of Qihoo 360 Inc.) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-6304.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

For the update to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system rebooted. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1412120#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 10:09:24 UTC  ``` The signing function in crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa_ossl.c in certain OpenSSL versions and forks is vulnerable to timing attacks when signing with the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite featuring constant-time curve operations and modular inversion. A software defect omits setting the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME flag for nonces, failing to take a secure code path in the BN_mod_inverse method and therefore resulting in a cache-timing attack vulnerability. A malicious user with local access can recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.

Sidhpurwala    2017-01-12 08:41:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to be have local (shell) access to the machine where the message is being signed using the ECDSA algorithm with a P-256 elliptic curve key. Then using cache timing attacks (which needs precise timing), on multiple signature runs, the private key could be obtained. Based on the factor that exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security Team has rated this flaw as having Moderate impact.

#### Paper 2016/1195

### Constant-Time Callees with Variable-Time Callers

Cesar Pereida Garcïa and Billy Bob Brumley

##### Abstract

Side-channel attacks are a serious threat to security-critical software. To mitigate remote timing and cache-timing attacks, many ubiquitous cryptography software libraries feature constant-time implementations of cryptographic primitives. In this work, we disclose a vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.0.1u that recovers ECDSA private keys for the standardized elliptic curve P-256 despite the library featuring both constant-time curve operations and modular inversion with microarchitecture attack mitigations. Exploiting this defect, we target
the errant modular inversion code path with a cache-timing and improved
performance degradation attack, recovering the inversion state sequence. We propose a new approach of extracting a variable number of nonce bits from these sequences, and improve upon the best theoretical result to recover private keys in a lattice attack with as few as 50 signatures and corresponding traces. As far as we are aware, this is the first timing attack against OpenSSL ECDSA that does not target scalar multiplication, the first side-channel attack on cryptosystems
leveraging P-256 constant-time scalar multiplication and furthermore, we extend our attack to TLS and SSH protocols, both linked to OpenSSL for P-256 ECDSA signing.
