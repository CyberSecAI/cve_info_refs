Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in tcpdump, a command-line
network traffic analyzer. These vulnerabilities might result in denial
of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.0-1~deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1871)

## Topic

An update for tcpdump is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The tcpdump packages contain the tcpdump utility for monitoring network traffic. The tcpdump utility can capture and display the packet headers on a particular network interface or on all interfaces.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: tcpdump (4.9.0). (BZ#1422473)

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple out of bounds read and integer overflow vulnerabilities were found in tcpdump affecting the decoding of various protocols. An attacker could create a crafted pcap file or send specially crafted packets to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode (without -w) which could cause it to display incorrect data, crash or enter an infinite loop. (CVE-2015-0261, CVE-2015-2153, CVE-2015-2154, CVE-2015-2155, CVE-2016-7922, CVE-2016-7923, CVE-2016-7924, CVE-2016-7925, CVE-2016-7926, CVE-2016-7927, CVE-2016-7928, CVE-2016-7929, CVE-2016-7930, CVE-2016-7931, CVE-2016-7932, CVE-2016-7933, CVE-2016-7934, CVE-2016-7935, CVE-2016-7936, CVE-2016-7937, CVE-2016-7938, CVE-2016-7939, CVE-2016-7940, CVE-2016-7973, CVE-2016-7974, CVE-2016-7975, CVE-2016-7983, CVE-2016-7984, CVE-2016-7985, CVE-2016-7986, CVE-2016-7992, CVE-2016-7993, CVE-2016-8574, CVE-2016-8575, CVE-2017-5202, CVE-2017-5203, CVE-2017-5204, CVE-2017-5205, CVE-2017-5341, CVE-2017-5342, CVE-2017-5482, CVE-2017-5483, CVE-2017-5484, CVE-2017-5485, CVE-2017-5486)

```
Package: release.debian.org
Severity: normal
User: release.debian....@packages.debian.org
Usertags: unblock
```
```

tcpdump 4.9.0 is a security upstream release which fixes 41 distinct
vulnerabilities, most of which are remotely exploitable. I would
appreciate if you could grant 4.9.0-1 an exemption from the current
mandatory 10-day migration delay rule. The debdiff is too large to
include, but the corresponding changelog entry is below. Thanks!
