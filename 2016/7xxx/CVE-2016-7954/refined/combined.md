| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1381951#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-05 12:19:13 UTC  ```  A vulnerability was found in Bundler. Bundler allows the user to specify sources from which Ruby gems are installed. If a secondary source is specified, even if scoped to a specific gem, that source is silently applied to all declared gems. This allows an attacker to introduce arbitrary code into an application via gem name collision on the secondary source, which will unexpectedly (and without warning) take priority over the primary source.  CVE request:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/18>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/20>  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/25>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1381951#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-05 12:20:15 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-bundler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1381952](show_bug.cgi?id=1381952 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-7954 rubygem-bundler: Code execution via gem name collision in bundler [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1381953](show_bug.cgi?id=1381953 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2016-7954 rubygem-bundler: Code execution via gem name collision in bundler [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1381951#c2)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-08-25 13:46:55 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/10/06/bundlers-multiple-source-security-vulnerability> <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/5051> <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/5274>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1381951#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2017-08-25 14:30:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact.

As demonstrated by [this blog post](http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/10/06/bundlers-multiple-source-security-vulnerability/), there is still a lot of end-user confusion about how to deal with the source issues originally revealed in [our original CVE announcement](http://bundler.io/blog/2014/08/14/bundler-may-install-gems-from-a-different-source-than-expected-cve-2013-0334.html).

A lot of that confusion is likely our fault as a team—we often weren't sure what was and wasn't possible even as we were trying to fix the problem. As the above-linked blog post mentions, the only way to be 100% safe in Bundler 1.x is to have no global sources.

The cross-source confusion is eliminated in the (as yet unreleased) Bundler 2.x series by a series of backwards-compatibility breaking changes to the format of the `Gemfile.lock` file and the way that Bundler handles gem sources internally. Once Bundler 2 is out, you'll be able to use one global source and additional non-global sources without worrying about any name conflicts.

As a result of these problems, let's try to make it clearer for users what they need to do:

* Update [the CVE warning post](http://bundler.io/blog/2014/08/14/bundler-may-install-gems-from-a-different-source-than-expected-cve-2013-0334.html) with clearer instructions around the possible problem and ways to avoid it
* Update the discussion of multiple sources in the Bundler docs to point out that this opens the possibility of name conflicts, and suggest using no global sources in Bundler 1.x Gemfiles.
* Update the existing warnings as needed to reflect the problems discussed in [the new blog post](http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/10/06/bundlers-multiple-source-security-vulnerability/)

This is a good chance for anyone to contribute, even if they aren't familiar with the Bundler code, since the explanations and warnings have all already been written down at least once. 👍

Subject: Re: Re: CVE request for code execution via gem name
 collission in bundler (was Re: CVE Request)

I asked the Bundler team about this issue since this seemed to be lacking
details. They said that they attempted to fix this generic issue in Bundler
1.7 (see
<http://bundler.io/blog/2014/08/14/bundler-may-install-gems-from-a-different-source-than-expected-cve-2013-0334.html>),
and they were able to fix most of the issues.

However, there are some edge cases, which I think Steve is referring to.
Specifically, see <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/3671>.
Additionally, see also <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/3696>
(failing spec that shows the issue) and
<https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/4714> (PR where the issue was fixed,
but only on Bundler 2.x branch).

The team was never able to remove all possibilities of namespace collisions
while keeping the existing lockfile format, which is why the fix was only
on Bundler 2.x.

# Bundler’s Multiple Source Security Vulnerability

## How Bundler is broken and what you can do about it

by
[Steve Richert](/blog/author/steve)

October 6, 2016

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) has a major security vulnerability that affects **all** stable versions. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into your application via any secondary gem source declared in your gemfile, *whether or not that source is scoped to specific gems*.

## CVE ID

[CVE-2016-7954](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7954) is assigned to this vulnerability.

Over two years ago, a similar vulnerability ([CVE-2013-0334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-0334)) was discovered and is described in [a post on Bundler’s blog](http://bundler.io/blog/2014/08/14/bundler-may-install-gems-from-a-different-source-than-expected-cve-2013-0334.html). The proposed resolution was to upgrade to Bundler 1.7+. This no longer resolves the issue and in fact, never did. All of the broken behaviors described below also apply to Bundler 1.7.

## Example

Bundler allows you to specify multiple sources for your gem dependencies. In some cases, which source to use for a given gem is unclear. To maximize that ambiguity for our examples, let’s consider a gemfile with two sources and three gems, all three of which are available from *both* sources.

```
source "http://public.org"
source "http://private.com"

gem "foo"
gem "bar"
gem "baz"
```
## Source Ambiguity Warnings

Ever since version 1.7.0, Bundler displays helpful warning messages whenever a gem could have been installed from any one of the multiple sources available. Bundler’s default behavior is to honor the last source. The output of `bundle install` for the gemfile above (using Bundler 1.13.2) is as follows:

```
Fetching source index from http://private.com/
Fetching source index from http://public.org/
Resolving dependencies...
Installing foo 1.0.0
Installing bar 1.0.0
Installing baz 1.0.0
Using bundler 1.13.2
Bundle complete! 3 Gemfile dependencies, 4 gems now installed.
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
Warning: the gem 'foo' was found in multiple sources.
Installed from: http://private.com/
Also found in:
  * http://public.org/
You should add a source requirement to restrict this gem to your preferred source.
For example:
    gem 'foo', :source => 'http://private.com/'
Then uninstall the gem 'foo' (or delete all bundled gems) and then install again.
Warning: the gem 'bar' was found in multiple sources.
Installed from: http://private.com/
Also found in:
  * http://public.org/
You should add a source requirement to restrict this gem to your preferred source.
For example:
    gem 'bar', :source => 'http://private.com/'
Then uninstall the gem 'bar' (or delete all bundled gems) and then install again.
Warning: the gem 'baz' was found in multiple sources.
Installed from: http://private.com/
Also found in:
  * http://public.org/
You should add a source requirement to restrict this gem to your preferred source.
For example:
    gem 'baz', :source => 'http://private.com/'
Then uninstall the gem 'baz' (or delete all bundled gems) and then install again.
```

These warning messages point out two ways to resolve the source ambiguity:

* a `source` block
* the `:source` option
  For demonstration purposes, let’s assume we only want to install the `bar` gem from the secondary (`private.com`) source. The `foo` and `baz` gems should be installed from our primary (`public.org`) source.

## The `:source` Option

Let’s start with trying to use the `:source` option since the warning messages give precise examples of how to do so. The updated gemfile is as follows:

```
source "http://public.org"

gem "foo"
gem "bar", source: "http://private.com"
gem "baz"
```

When I run `bundle install` with this new gemfile (after uninstalling all gems), here’s the output I get:

```
Fetching source index from http://private.com/
Fetching source index from http://public.org/
Resolving dependencies...
Installing foo 1.0.0
Installing bar 1.0.0
Installing baz 1.0.0
Using bundler 1.13.2
Bundle complete! 3 Gemfile dependencies, 4 gems now installed.
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```

I didn’t receive any warnings, so my assumption is that `foo` and `baz` installed from my primary source (`public.org`) while `bar` installed from my secondary source (`private.com`). Unfortunately, that is **not** the case.
**All three gems are installed from the secondary source.**
I was able to test this behavior by starting two gem servers on separate ports, each with all three gems available. Then I ran `bundle` from a clean slate and watched the gem server logs to determine which gems were requested of each server.

![](/assets/bundler_source_option.gif)

As you can see from the server logs of the two gem servers, all three gems were installed from the secondary gem server. This is **not** the expected behavior.

## `source` Blocks

Another potential solution is to wrap gem declarations within a `source` block for the secondary source. Here’s the updated gemfile:

```
source "http://public.org"

gem "newcomb"

source "http://private.com" do
  gem "fair_dice_roll"
end

gem "insecure_random"
```

**Same problem.**

![](/assets/bundler_source_block.gif)
## So what?

Bundler’s unexpected behavior means that the addition of a secondary source opens *all* of your gems up to being installed from an unknown or unexpected location. At its worst, an attacker can introduce arbitrary code to phone home with your sensitive configuration values or data.
Consider the following gemfile:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "rails"

group :development, :test, :console do
  gem "handy_dev_helpers", source: "https://helpfuldeveloper.org"
end
```

You may already be wary of secondary gem sources, so perhaps you `bundle open` the `“handy_dev_helpers”` gem to inspect its contents and determine that it’s safe to use.
However, if the `helpfuldeveloper.org` gem server also makes a `“rails”` gem available, that `“rails”` gem will be used instead of the gem from `rubygems.org`. The imposter gem may behave exactly like Rails, but it may also have additional code meant to compromise your information.
With the gemfile above, Bundler would have given no warning or indication that the source for `“rails”` is ambiguous.

## How To Protect Yourself

**Use multiple source blocks.**
The only way I was able to properly map each gem to its proper source was to put every gem declaration within its own source block rather than having any concept of a primary source.

```
source "http://public.org" do
  gem "foo"
  gem "baz"
end

source "http://private.com" do
  gem "bar"
end
```
![](/assets/bundler_source_blocks.gif)

This is currently the only way (besides having a single source) to ensure that all of your gems install from their expected sources.

## Fixing Bundler

I discovered this vulnerability in March, 2016. After running and documenting my intitial tests, I wrote a report (much like this blog post) and sent it to the Bundler team on April 1.
It seems as though this vulnerability has been patched in the development of Bundler 2. *However*, I’m told that there is no plan to backport the fix to Bundler 1 since that requires backwards incompatible changes. As of this writing, I have received no response to my suggestions to update warning message recommendations and/or to add warning messages for the silent problematic cases.
Fifteen versions of Bundler have been released since my initial report in April, four since my latest email with the team.
**Bundle safely!** Steer clear of global sources!

In my point of view thats only a minor issue. If you trust <http://public.org> to deliver gem ‘foo’, then you have to expand your trust that <http://public.org> wont offer you other gems.

In my point of view it’s more likely that an attacker replaces gem ‘foo’ with malicous code or intercepts your http-connection then that someone offers you another gem ‘bar’. That gem ‘foo’ exists an attacker knows. That you use gem ‘bar’ an attacker does only know when your software is opensource.

All this boils down to if you trust an external source you realy have to trust it. As long as gems are not signed.

@slowjack, Maybe I’m misunderstanding things, but I believe the problem is pretty real. If I have a private gem named ‘mycompany-x’ on Gemfury and an attacker figures that out and publishes `mycompany-x` to RubyGems since it isn’t taken yet. In this case depending on how I setup my Gemfile I could be installing the attackers source code.

In that scenario this has nothing to do with whether or not I trust RubyGems. Anyone can publish an unpublished gem name to RubyGems.

The scenario may be unlikely but not impossible. To be honest though we’ve been looking at using private gems and modularizing our code more and we’ve found Bundler and Rubygems infuriating. We’re actually seriously considering using NPM for this instead.

Subject: CVE Request

Hello,

I'd like to request a CVE to track a security vulnerability found in Bundler (bundler.io <<http://bundler.io/>>). Bundler allows the user to specify sources from which Ruby gems are installed. If a secondary source is specified, even if scoped to a specific gem, that source is silently applied to all declared gems. This allows an attacker to introduce arbitrary code into an application via gem name collision on the secondary source, which will unexpectedly (and without warning) take priority over the primary source.

The issue seems to exist in all 1.x versions of Bundler. Bundler 2 is still in development and seems to resolve the issue. The Bundler team does not currently plan on releasing a patch for 1.x versions.

No CVE has been requested previously that I'm aware of.

Thank you!
