    "CVE-2016-7031": {
      "description": "A flaw was found in Ceph RGW code which allows an anonymous user to list contents of RGW bucket by bypassing ACL which should only allow authenticated users to list contents of bucket.",
      "root_cause": "The public user ID in Rados Gateway (RGW), defined by `RGW_USER_ANON_ID`, was not being correctly compared during public read requests. Instead, the user's ID was being checked against the public user group's URI, causing anonymous users to be incorrectly identified as authenticated users.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect access control check for anonymous users.",
        "Incorrect creation of bucket_acl objects, not considering the request dialect (S3 or Swift)."
      ],
      "impact": "An anonymous user can list the contents of a bucket that should only be accessible to authenticated users, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing a bucket using a publicly generated URL with 'authenticated-read' ACL set."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires no authentication and can exploit the vulnerability using a public URL."
