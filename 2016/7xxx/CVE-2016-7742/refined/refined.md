- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The use of an uninitialized variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized variable usage in `xar` tool.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Opening a maliciously crafted archive using `xar` may lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted archive files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a crafted archive file that exploits the uninitialized variable vulnerability in `xar`. A local user can open this malicious file to trigger the exploit.
