The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Exponent CMS 2.3.9, which aligns with the nature of a CVE request. Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability:

**1. Arbitrary Code Execution via Configuration File Modification**

*   **Root Cause:** The `expSettings::change()` function modifies the `config.php` file based on user-controlled input (`$_REQUEST['sc']`) without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into the configuration file.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided example shows how `phpinfo()` can be executed.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `install/index.php` script with the `sc` parameter containing malicious PHP code, such as `?sc[SMTP_PORT]=25\');phpinfo();//`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**2. Remote Code Execution via Profile Loading**

*   **Root Cause:** The `expSettings::activateProfile()` function copies a user-provided file to `config.php` without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses:** Path traversal vulnerability and lack of file type validation allow an attacker to copy a malicious PHP file to `config.php`.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1. Upload a malicious PHP file to the server via `uploader_paste.php`.
    2. Send a crafted HTTP request to `install/index.php` with a `profile` parameter pointing to the uploaded malicious PHP file (e.g., `?profile=../../../files/test`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to upload files to the server, in this case by using `uploader_paste.php`.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**3. File Upload/Extraction Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `install_sample` parameter is used to specify a `.tar.gz` file, which is then extracted to the server without validation.
*   **Weaknesses:** Path traversal vulnerability in the `install_sample` parameter and lack of validation of the extracted content lead to arbitrary file creation on the server.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload/creation via malicious archive extraction.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1. Upload a malicious `.tar.gz` archive to the server via `uploader_paste.php`.
    2. Send a crafted HTTP request to `install/index.php` with `install_sample` pointing to the uploaded archive(e.g., `?install_sample=../../files/10`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to upload files to the server using `uploader_paste.php`.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   Ability to create a malicious archive file.
