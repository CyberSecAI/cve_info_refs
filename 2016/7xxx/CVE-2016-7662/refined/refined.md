The provided content includes information about CVE-2016-7662 in multiple Apple products: iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.3, and macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Security Update 2016-003 El Capitan, and Security Update 2016-007 Yosemite.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A certificate evaluation issue existed in certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper evaluation of certificates during the validation process. Specifically, the system may unexpectedly evaluate certificates as trusted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Certificates that should not be trusted may be evaluated as trusted, potentially leading to security compromises.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the certificate validation process. The specific method is not described beyond a "certificate evaluation issue".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be in a position to provide a maliciously crafted or compromised certificate that would normally be rejected through proper validation. The specific position required by the attacker will vary.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**
This issue was addressed through additional validation of certificates. The scope and impact are consistent across iOS, watchOS, and macOS.
