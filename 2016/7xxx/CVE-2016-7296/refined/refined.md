- **Root Cause:** Memory corruption in the scripting engine when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of objects in memory within the scripting engine.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Hosting a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
  - Embedding an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" within an application or Microsoft Office document.
  - Utilizing compromised websites or those that host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to view a malicious website or open a malicious document. They cannot force the user to do so.
