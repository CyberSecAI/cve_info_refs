Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-7791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the `install/index.php` script handles the `install_sample` parameter. Specifically, the script constructs a file path based on user-supplied input without sufficient validation, allowing an attacker to control the path of the archive to be extracted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `$files` variable, used to identify the archive to be extracted, is built using user-controlled input (`$_REQUEST['install_sample']`). This allows an attacker to provide path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory, specifically the /files directory where the attacker previously uploaded a malicious archive file.
- **Arbitrary File Extraction:** The `Archive_Tar` class extracts the user-controlled archive to the webroot. This enables the attacker to extract an archive containing arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server, which can include php files.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and then extracting a malicious archive containing PHP files, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** In the worst case, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the server by placing a web shell on the server

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `install/index.php` script, providing a malicious path in the `install_sample` parameter. The malicious archive is placed on the webserver using another vulnerability in the same CMS.
  -  `http://www.exponentcms.org/install/index.php?install_sample=../../files/10`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to make HTTP requests to the target server.
- **File Upload:** The attacker needs to have already uploaded a malicious `.tar.gz` archive to a web accessible directory. This can be accomplished using the vulnerable 'uploader_paste.php' script.
