      "Cve Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Github Commit": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the profile handling, specifically within the WriteTo8BimProfile function. This occurs when processing profile data, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer Overflow, Out-of-bounds read",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is a crash (SEGV) due to memory corruption, which can lead to denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted image with a malformed profile.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that ImageMagick attempts to process."
    },

      "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is a segmentation fault (SEGV) leading to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image file designed to trigger the vulnerability in the profile handling.",
