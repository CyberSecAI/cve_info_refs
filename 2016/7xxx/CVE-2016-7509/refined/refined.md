Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7509:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data when handling HTML file attachments in GLPI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the application not properly handling HTML file attachments. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the context of the GLPI application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser when they access the ticket with the crafted attachment. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
   - Stealing session cookies, leading to account compromise.
   - Phishing attacks.
   - Defacement of the GLPI interface.
   - Other malicious actions within the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the GLPI application.
- The attacker attaches a crafted HTML file to a ticket.
- When a user views this ticket and its attachment, the malicious script embedded in the HTML file is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the GLPI application.
- The attacker must have the ability to create or modify tickets to attach the crafted HTML file.
