- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue existed in the handling of the idle timer when the Touch ID prompt is shown.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device may not lock the screen after the idle timeout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The device may remain unlocked after the user expects the device to lock due to idle timeout. This could potentially expose the device's data to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** A user is required to have physical access to the iOS device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to trigger the Touch ID prompt and then wait for the idle timeout to expire.
