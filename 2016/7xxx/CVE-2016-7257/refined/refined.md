  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the Windows GDI component's improper handling of objects in memory, leading to an information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of objects in memory",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve information that may enable further compromise of the user's system. Specifically, it could enable an Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted document",
       "Convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage",
       "Convincing a use to run a specially crafted application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious document or visit a malicious website, or run a crafted application."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2016-7257",
  "additional_information": "This vulnerability is associated with an information disclosure, which means it does not directly enable arbitrary code execution. However, an ASLR bypass can be a component of a more complex attack that includes a remote code execution vulnerability."
