Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate web service tokens when a user's password is changed or forced to be changed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Web service tokens remain active even after a user's password change.
- Lack of proper session invalidation upon password modification

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially maintain access to a user's account through a previously obtained web service token, even after the user has changed their password. This could allow the attacker to continue accessing the Moodle mobile app and potentially other areas of the system via web services.
- Data breach/unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could obtain a web service token through various methods, potentially by compromising the user’s device, intercepting network traffic or if the user's device or system is compromised.
- The attacker would then wait for the victim to change the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have previously obtained a valid web service token for the target user.
- The attacker doesn’t need a position inside the system to carry out this attack.
- The attacker has to wait for a password change from the victim.

**Affected Versions:**
- Moodle versions 3.1 to 3.1.1, 3.0 to 3.0.5, 2.9 to 2.9.7, 2.8 to 2.8.12, 2.7 to 2.7.15 and earlier unsupported versions.
