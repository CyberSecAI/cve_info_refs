      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a missing type check in the unserialization process of `SplArray` objects within the `ext/spl/spl_array.c` file.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of invalid objects during unserialization leading to a missing type check.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly achieve unspecified other impact through crafted serialized data.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by providing specially crafted serialized data.",

  "CVE-2016-7124": {
    "match": true,
    "relevant_content": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of certain invalid objects during the unserialization process in `ext/standard/var_unserializer.c`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code mishandles invalid objects, leading to missing validations, potentially triggering \_\_destruct or other magic method calls with unexpected consequences.",

    "match": true,
    "relevant_content": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is rooted in the way PHP skips invalid session names, which leads to incorrect parsing of session data.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code skips invalid session names during parsing, resulting in incorrect handling that could allow arbitrary session data injection. Specifically, it is susceptible to object injection.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary-type session data, potentially leading to object injection and other unspecified impacts.",

    "match": true,
    "relevant_content": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `php_wddx_push_element` function within the `ext/wddx/wddx.c` file, specifically in how it handles boolean elements within a WDDX packet.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The function does not properly validate boolean elements, leading to an invalid pointer access and an out-of-bounds read.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or have other unspecified impact.",

      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the locale length provided to the Locale class in the ICU library, causing an incorrect parsing.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by making an application crash or other unspecified impacts.",
      "Attack vectors": "This is done by leveraging a long locale string in a `MessageFormatter::formatMessage` call.",

      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The mysqlnd driver is susceptible to a heap overflow when it encounters BIT fields without the UNSIGNED flag. This occurs due to mishandling of data size.",
