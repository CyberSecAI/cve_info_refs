Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `cron/find_help.php` file where the `$_GET['version']` parameter is used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `$_GET['version']` parameter allows for SQL injection. Specifically, a time-based blind SQL injection is possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify data within the database, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
- **Denial of Service:** Depending on the injection, attackers might be able to slow down the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `version` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic knowledge of SQL to craft effective SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The `seclists.org` content explicitly states that this is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- The provided GitHub commit `a8efd9ca71fc9b8b843ad0910d435d237482ee31` shows that the fix involves sanitizing the `$_GET['version']` parameter using `expString::escape()`.
