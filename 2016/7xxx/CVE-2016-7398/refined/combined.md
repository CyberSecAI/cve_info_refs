Affected is the `merge_param()` function in php_http_params.c that is called from `php_http_querystring_parse()`:    Code fragment from `merge_param()` in php_http_params.c:491:      static void merge_param(HashTable *params, zval *zdata, ...)     {     [...]         while (Z_TYPE_P(zdata_ptr) == IS_ARRAY && (test_ptr = zend_hash_get_current_data(Z_ARRVAL_P(zdata_ptr)))) {             if (Z_TYPE_P(test_ptr) == IS_ARRAY) {                 zval *tmp_ptr = ptr;          [...]                            } else {                     if ((ptr = zend_hash_index_find(Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr), hkey.h))) {                         zdata_ptr = test_ptr;                     } else if (hkey.h) {                         ptr = tmp_ptr;                         Z_TRY_ADDREF_P(test_ptr);     [511]               ptr = zend_hash_index_update(Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr), hkey.h, test_ptr);     [...]  In line 511 `zend_hash_index_update()` is called with ptr used as an array (`Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr)`) without actually checking its type. Thus it was possible to call `zend_hash_index_update()` on a zend_string instead which obviously leads to memory corruption issues.  The sample request provided in this report uses this type confusion vulnerability to trigger an arbitrary heap overwrite. The actual overwrite occurs in `_zend_hash_index_add_or_update_i()`:       static zend_always_inline zval *_zend_hash_index_add_or_update_i(HashTable *ht, zend_ulong h, zval *pData, uint32_t flag ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC)     {     [...]     add_to_hash:     [...]         p = ht->arData + idx;         p->h = h;						// <- heap overflow         p->key = NULL;					// <- heap overflow     [...]     }  Because of the invalid pointer provided as HashTable `ht->arData` points to an unexpected memory location on the heap and not to the list of Buckets of an ordinary HashTable. So the two following assignments allow to write arbitrary values (`hkey.h` and NULL) on the heap. As it turned out `hkey.h` can be controlled with request data received from the network.   The attached proof of concept demonstrates that this flaw very likely allows for remote code execution.

Affected is the `merge_param()` function in php_http_params.c that is called from `php_http_querystring_parse()`:    Code fragment from `merge_param()` in php_http_params.c:491:      static void merge_param(HashTable *params, zval *zdata, ...)     {     [...]         while (Z_TYPE_P(zdata_ptr) == IS_ARRAY && (test_ptr = zend_hash_get_current_data(Z_ARRVAL_P(zdata_ptr)))) {             if (Z_TYPE_P(test_ptr) == IS_ARRAY) {                 zval *tmp_ptr = ptr;          [...]                            } else {                     if ((ptr = zend_hash_index_find(Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr), hkey.h))) {                         zdata_ptr = test_ptr;                     } else if (hkey.h) {                         ptr = tmp_ptr;                         Z_TRY_ADDREF_P(test_ptr);     [511]               ptr = zend_hash_index_update(Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr), hkey.h, test_ptr);     [...]  In line 511 `zend_hash_index_update()` is called with ptr used as an array (`Z_ARRVAL_P(ptr)`) without actually checking its type. Thus it was possible to call `zend_hash_index_update()` on a zend_string instead which obviously leads to memory corruption issues.  The sample request provided in this report uses this type confusion vulnerability to trigger an arbitrary heap overwrite. The actual overwrite occurs in `_zend_hash_index_add_or_update_i()`:       static zend_always_inline zval *_zend_hash_index_add_or_update_i(HashTable *ht, zend_ulong h, zval *pData, uint32_t flag ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC)     {     [...]     add_to_hash:     [...]         p = ht->arData + idx;         p->h = h;						// <- heap overflow         p->key = NULL;					// <- heap overflow     [...]     }  Because of the invalid pointer provided as HashTable `ht->arData` points to an unexpected memory location on the heap and not to the list of Buckets of an ordinary HashTable. So the two following assignments allow to write arbitrary values (`hkey.h` and NULL) on the heap. As it turned out `hkey.h` can be controlled with request data received from the network.   The attached proof of concept demonstrates that this flaw very likely allows for remote code execution.

Package        : php-pecl-http
Version        : 2.0.4-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-7398

A vulnerability has been discovered in php-pecl-http, the pecl_http
module for PHP 5 Extended HTTP Support.  A type confusion vulnerability
in the merge_param() function allows attackers to crash PHP and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP requests.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.4-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-pecl-http packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
