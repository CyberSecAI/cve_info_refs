Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `merge_param()` function within `php_http_params.c` of the `pecl_http` PHP extension. This function is used to merge parameters during the parsing of HTTP query strings.
- The core issue is a type confusion. The `zend_hash_index_update()` function is called on a variable (`ptr`) that is assumed to be a HashTable (array), but can be a `zend_string` under specific conditions. This leads to memory corruption because `zend_hash_index_update` attempts to access the underlying bucket structure of a HashTable, which is not present in a `zend_string`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The code does not properly validate the type of `ptr` before using it as a HashTable, leading to the type confusion vulnerability.
- **Heap Overflow:** When `zend_hash_index_update` is called with a `zend_string`, it attempts to write to memory locations based on the structure of a HashTable. This can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. The specific overflow occurs within `_zend_hash_index_add_or_update_i()` where `p->h` and `p->key` are written to memory pointed to by `ht->arData`, which is an invalid pointer in this case.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The type confusion and resulting heap overflow leads to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary Heap Overwrite:** By controlling input parameters, an attacker can control the value written to the heap during the overflow (`hkey.h`).
- **Crash:** The memory corruption can lead to a crash of the PHP process due to an invalid pointer being freed.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to overwrite heap metadata, indicating the high likelihood of achieving remote code execution by carefully crafting input to overwrite function pointers etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Query String:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing HTTP query strings using `php_http_querystring_parse()`.
- **Malicious HTTP Request:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request containing a specially crafted query string that triggers the type confusion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a PHP application that uses the vulnerable `pecl_http` extension.
- **Understanding of HTTP Query String Syntax:** The attacker needs a good understanding of the HTTP query string syntax in order to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding an additional type check in the `merge_param()` function. Specifically, ensuring `Z_TYPE_P(ptr)` is of type array along with `Z_TYPE_P(test_ptr)`.
- The vulnerability was discovered using fuzzing techniques.
- This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-7398

In summary, CVE-2016-7398 describes a type confusion vulnerability in the `merge_param()` function of the `pecl_http` PHP extension. By sending a malicious HTTP query string, an attacker can cause a heap overflow, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided information provides significant details regarding the vulnerability that could be useful when developing mitigations or exploit analysis.
