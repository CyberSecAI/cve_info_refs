{
  "CVE-2016-7637": {
    "Description": "A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved input validation.",
    "Root cause": "A memory corruption issue.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user may be able to gain root privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Local user"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The exploit utilizes a mach port name uref handling vulnerability to achieve privileged port name replacement. This can lead to a user-after-deallocate condition in a userspace process, by sending a large number of out-of-line (OOL) port rights which saturates the user reference (uref) count, ultimately freeing a mach port name while the process still believes it is valid, after which the name can be reallocated."
