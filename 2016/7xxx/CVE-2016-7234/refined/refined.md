Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7234:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in Microsoft Office software. Specifically, the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability, leading to potential remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with limited user rights could also be impacted, though to a lesser extent compared to users with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- **Email Attack:** An attacker could send a malicious file via email and persuade the recipient to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a website, or compromise an existing one, hosting a specially crafted file that exploits the vulnerability and then persuade users to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- The attacker requires a way to deliver the crafted file to the victim, either via email or through a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes**
- The "Preview Pane" is explicitly stated as *not* being an attack vector for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Important" in terms of severity.
- Multiple Microsoft Office products and versions are affected.
