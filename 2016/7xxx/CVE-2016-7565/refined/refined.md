Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7565:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `install/index.php` file of Exponent CMS, specifically within the `expSettings::change()` function. This function modifies the `framework/conf/config.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution via Config File Manipulation:**
    *   The `expSettings::change()` function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the configuration file by manipulating the `$_REQUEST['sc']` parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted request to the `install/index.php` script, allowing the attacker to overwrite settings in the configuration file.
2.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Profile Loading:**
    *   The `expSettings::activateProfile()` function allows loading a configuration profile specified via the `$_REQUEST['profile']` parameter. This function copies the profile file to `framework/conf/config.php`.
    *   An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file and then use the `profile` parameter to copy this file to the configuration location, which will lead to RCE when the code is executed by the webserver.
3.  **Arbitrary File Extraction:**
    *   The `install/index.php` script extracts a `.tar.gz` archive based on the value of the `install_sample` parameter, which is not properly sanitized.
    *   An attacker can upload a malicious .tar.gz file and then use the `install_sample` parameter to extract this file to an arbitrary location on the server. This can overwrite critical files or place malicious code on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** By exploiting the arbitrary code execution vulnerability, the attacker could gain complete control over the webserver. This allows the attacker to modify, delete, or exfiltrate data, install malicious software, or conduct further attacks.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could compromise the CMS application and access sensitive information within the database.
*   **Website Defacement or Manipulation:** An attacker can modify the website content, redirect users, or use the compromised site as a platform to spread malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker would use specially crafted HTTP requests targeting the `install/index.php` script.
*   **File Upload:** The RCE via profile loading and arbitrary file extraction exploits require the ability to upload files to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where Exponent CMS is hosted.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities does not require authentication by an attacker.
*  **Ability to upload files**: RCE via profile loading and arbitrary file extraction requires an initial file upload using a separate vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) for each vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in a commit, which included moving security checks earlier in the install code and sanitizing user inputs.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Peng Hua of silence.com.cn Inc. (PKAV Team).
*   The commit fixing the issue is 4ae457ff1bf80e8b61286cd125ca794b25564e86.
