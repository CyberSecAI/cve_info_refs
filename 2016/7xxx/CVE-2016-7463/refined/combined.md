##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi updates address a cross-site scripting issue

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. Host Client stored cross-site scripting issue**

The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for stored cross-site scripting (XSS). The issue can be introduced by an attacker that has permission to manage virtual machines through ESXi Host Client or by tricking the vSphere administrator to import a specially crafted VM. The issue may be triggered on the system from where ESXi Host Client is used to manage the specially crafted VM.

VMware advises not to import VMs from untrusted sources.

VMware would like to thank Caleb Watt (@calebwatt15) for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7463 to this issue.
