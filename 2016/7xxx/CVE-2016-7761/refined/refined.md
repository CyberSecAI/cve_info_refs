- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Network configuration was unexpectedly global.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive network configuration was not properly isolated to per-user settings, making it accessible to other users on the same system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious local user may be able to view sensitive network configuration information.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with access to the system could view sensitive network configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
