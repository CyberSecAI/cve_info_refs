Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7839:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw caused by improper processing of the `search` parameter in Olive Blog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (CWE-79). The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `search` parameter before rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `search` parameter and lure a victim to visit that URL.
- The attack complexity is medium (AC:M) under CVSSv2, indicating the attack requires some level of specific conditions or is not easily repeatable. Under CVSSv3 the attack complexity is low (AC:L), indicating that the exploit is easily repeatable.
- User interaction is required (UI:R) because a user needs to click a malicious link for the attack to occur.
- The scope is changed (S:C) because the injected script executes in the context of the targeted domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `search` parameter, and convince the victim to open the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected software, Olive Blog, is no longer being developed or maintained, and the recommended solution is to discontinue its use.
- This vulnerability was reported by Ueki Shuya.
- JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer under the Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
