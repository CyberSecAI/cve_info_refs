## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

```
Hello,

I'd found a CSRF issue in Monit(<https://mmonit.com/monit/>) in the Service
Manager application that affects versions 5.19.0 and earlier. Red Hat has
assigned CVE-2016-7067 to this issue. Monit has fixed this issue in version
5.20.0

Description:
The forms in Monit's Service Manager are vulnerable to a cross site request
forgery attack.
Successful exploitation will enable an attacker to disable/enable all
monitoring for a particular host, disable/enable monitoring for a specific
service.

### Monit Distributions

Most Unix distributions include Monit. Please consult with your package manager. Also check that they have a recent
Monit version

![](img/freebsd.png)
###### BSD

Both FreeBSD and OpenBSD include Monit packages.

![](img/linux.png)
###### Linux

Many Linux distributions include Monit. From *.deb* to *.rpm* packages

![](img/osx.png)
###### Other Platforms

Packages for both macOS and Solaris *.pkg* exist.

### What Monit can do

![](img/radar@2x.png)
###### Proactive

Monit can act if an error situation should occur, e.g.; if sendmail is not running, Monit can start
sendmail again automatically or if apache is using too much resources (e.g. if a DoS attack is in
progress) Monit can stop or restart apache and send you an alert message. Monit can also monitor process
characteristics, such as; how much memory or cpu cycles a process is using.

![](img/Gear@2x.png)
###### Processes

You can use Monit to monitor daemon processes or similar programs running on localhost. Monit is
particularly useful for monitoring daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time from
/etc/init/ For instance sendmail, sshd, apache and mysql.

![](img/ffile@2x.png)
###### Files, Dirs and Filesystems

You can also use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems on localhost. Monit can monitor
these items for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes. This is also
useful for security reasons - you can monitor the md5 or sha1 checksum of files that should not change
and get an alert or perform an action if they should change.

![](img/cloud@2x.png)
###### Cloud and Hosts

Monitor network connections to various servers, either on localhost or on remote hosts. TCP, UDP and Unix Domain
Sockets are supported. Network tests can be performed on a protocol level; Monit has built-in tests for the main
Internet protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP etc. Even if a protocol is not supported you can still test the server as
you can configure Monit to send any data and test the response from the server.

![](img/program@2x.png)
###### Programs and scripts

Monit can be used to test programs or scripts at certain times, much like cron, but in addition, you can
test the exit value of a program and perform an action or send an alert if the exit value indicates an
error. This means that you can use Monit to perform any type of check you can write a script for.

![](img/system@2x.png)
###### System

Finally, Monit can be used to monitor general system resources on localhost such as overall CPU usage,
Memory, Load Average and Network Interfaces.

### Design philosophy

It is important for a system monitoring tool to just work - all the time, and you should be able to trust it to do
so. A system monitoring tool needs to be non-intrusive and you should be able to forget about it once it's
installed. That is, until sshd dies on your hosted server. When this happens, it is good to know that you have
installed this extra layer of security and protection, just wait a few seconds and Monit will restart the sshd
daemon. It is also helpful to get an email alert before the server disks are full or if your http server suddenly
is under a DDoS attack.

Monit is designed as an autonomous system and does not depend on plugins nor any special libraries to run.
Instead it works right out of the box and can utilize existing infrastructure already on your system. For
instance, Monit will easily integrate with init, upstart or systemd and can use existing run-level scripts to
manage services.

Monit compiles and run on most flavors of Unix. It is a small program and weights in at around 500kB (stripped). There is
support for compiling with glibc replacements such as uClibc if you need it to be even smaller.

###### FAQ and HOWTO

The FAQ and a list of HOWTOs can be found in the Monit [Wiki](../wiki/)

### Monit Screenshots

Monit has built-in a lightweight HTTP(S) interface you can use to browse the Monit server and check the
status of all monitored services. From the web-interface you can start, stop and restart processes and
disable or enable monitoring of services.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
