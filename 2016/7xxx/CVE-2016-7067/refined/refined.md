Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7067:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in the forms within Monit's Service Manager.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to trick a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to the Monit server.
- Lack of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF mechanisms in the forms used by the Service Manager component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack can lead to the following actions being performed by the targeted Monit server:
   - Disabling/enabling all monitoring for a particular host.
   - Disabling/enabling monitoring for a specific service.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is a crafted malicious web page or link that, when opened by a logged-in Monit user, triggers a forged request to the Monit server through the user's browser.
   - The attacker leverages the user's authenticated session with the Monit web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in Monit user to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link, or inject the malicious code in a page the user is visiting
- The attacker does not need direct access to the Monit server but needs the Monit user to interact with the malicious content in a browser.
- The attacker needs to know the basic form structure used by the Monit Service Manager to control service monitoring.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Monit versions 5.19.0 and earlier.
- It was fixed in version 5.20.0.
- The fix was introduced with commit c6ec3820e627f85417053e6336de2987f2d863e3 on the Monit project's repository.
- This vulnerability allows an attacker to enable or disable monitoring of services remotely.
