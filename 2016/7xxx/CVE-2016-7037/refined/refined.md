The provided content relates to **CVE-2016-7037**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the usage of a non-timing-safe string comparison in the `verify()` function of the `Symmetric.php` file. Specifically, the code uses `==` for comparing HMAC hashes, which is vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Timing Attack:** The use of `==` for comparing the computed and provided hash allows an attacker to infer information about the correct hash by observing the time taken for comparison. This is because the comparison will exit early if the compared characters differ.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Signature Forgery:** An attacker can exploit the timing attack to craft a valid signature for arbitrary content. By iteratively guessing parts of the hash, they can observe timing differences and gradually determine the correct signature. This enables them to manipulate the JWT tokens by creating false claims.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can mount this attack remotely. This is because the token verification happens on the server side where attacker can send a series of tokens with crafted signatures and observe the timing of server responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to submit requests with a manipulated JWT and measure response time. They would not need any prior knowledge of the secret key used for creating the signature.
