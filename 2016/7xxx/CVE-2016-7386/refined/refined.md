  "cveId": "CVE-2016-7386",
  "description": "NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x70000D4 which may lead to leaking of kernel memory contents to user space through an uninitialized buffer.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler for escape code `0x70000D4`. The driver allocates a buffer using `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` with a size provided by the user. However, this buffer is never initialized before being copied to a user-provided buffer using `memcpy`. This allows a user-mode program to leak uninitialized kernel memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows a user-mode program to read uninitialized kernel memory, potentially exposing sensitive information. While the impact is only information disclosure, and not code execution or privilege escalation, the leaked information could be used to further compromise the system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local exploitation"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "A local user can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted `DxgkDdiEscape` request with the specific escape code `0x70000D4` and a user-controlled size, leveraging the lack of memory initialization within the driver's handler."
