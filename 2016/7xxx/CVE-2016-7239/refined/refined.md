**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of regular expressions in the browser's XSS filter
- Information disclosure vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from web pages.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to:
1. Log on to an affected system.
2. Run a specially crafted application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the affected system is required.
- The attacker needs the ability to run a custom crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.
- The fix involves modifying how the XSS filter handles RegEx.
- This is an information disclosure vulnerability, not a remote code execution vulnerability.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds are identified.
