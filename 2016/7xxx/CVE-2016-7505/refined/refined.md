The provided content is related to CVE-2016-7505.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow exists in the `divby` function within `jsdtoa.c` of the MuJS library due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing corrupted JavaScript input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `divby` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A segmentation fault occurs, leading to program termination.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is crafted for that purpose.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted JavaScript input.
- The input is processed by `js_strtod` which calls `divascii` and eventually `divby` where the overflow occurs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious JavaScript input that triggers the vulnerability in the `divby` function. This input must be crafted to overflow the buffer in the `divby` function.
