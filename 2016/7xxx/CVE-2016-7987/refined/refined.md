- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is caused by specially crafted packets sent to TCP port 2404, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, potentially requiring a cold start to recover the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious packets to TCP port 2404.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device on port 2404/TCP. Low skill is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
