  "CVE-2016-7907": {
    "Description": "The imx_fec_do_tx function in hw/net/imx_fec.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) does not properly limit the buffer descriptor count when transmitting packets, which allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving a buffer descriptor with a length of 0 and crafted values in bd.flags.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improperly limiting the buffer descriptor count when transmitting packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop due to unbounded buffer descriptor processing.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "A local guest OS administrator can exploit the vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local guest OS administrator with the ability to manipulate buffer descriptors."
