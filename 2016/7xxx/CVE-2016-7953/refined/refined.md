Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-7953:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation of server responses in the `libXvMC` library when processing data from an X server. Specifically, the library doesn't properly check the length of strings received from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Underrun:** The vulnerability manifests as a one-byte buffer read underrun. This occurs when processing the `nameLen` or `busIDLen` fields in a server response, where if either is 0, the code will try to access `rep.nameLen - 1` which results in accessing memory out of bounds, specifically at index -1.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a buffer underrun, which could potentially lead to crashes, denial of service, or possibly further exploitation, depending on how memory is laid out and accessed after the underrun.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised X server sending crafted, invalid responses to a vulnerable `libXvMC` client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the X server that the vulnerable `libXvMC` client connects to. This could be a scenario where a less privileged user is able to modify a virtual X server (like Xvfb or Xephyr) and then connect a privileged client (like a screen lock program) to it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `XvMCGetDRInfo` function within `src/XvMC.c`
*   The fix involves adding a check to prevent accessing `rep.nameLen - 1` if `rep.nameLen` is zero. The same fix was applied to `rep.busIDLen`.
*   The vulnerability was present in `libXvMC` versions 1.0.9 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in `libXvMC` version 1.0.10 and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tobias Stoeckmann.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in `libXvMC` (CVE-2016-7953) stems from inadequate input validation when processing data from an X server, specifically regarding string lengths, which can lead to a buffer underrun. An attacker controlling the X server can exploit this to potentially cause a crash, denial of service, or further compromise a client.
