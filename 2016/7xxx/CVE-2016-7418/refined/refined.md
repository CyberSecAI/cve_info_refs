Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-7418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `php_wddx_push_element` function within the `wddx.c` file of PHP. Specifically, the function's logic contains an out-of-bounds read when processing XML attributes during WDDX deserialization. The function iterates through attributes and, under certain conditions, increments the loop counter `i` and attempts to access `atts[i]` without ensuring it is within the bounds of the `atts` array. If a "name" attribute is encountered, the code increments the loop counter and checks `atts[++i]` without checking if `i` is still within the bounds of the atts array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `php_wddx_push_element` function. Specifically, after checking for an attribute named "Name", the code increments the loop counter `i` and proceeds to check the next attribute in the `atts` array without verifying if `i` is still within the array's valid range. This can lead to reading arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Type Confusion** : The AddressSanitizer output shows an issue with strcmp, which is likely caused by the out-of-bounds read returning an invalid pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can craft a specially formed WDDX XML document that, when deserialized by PHP, triggers the out-of-bounds read. This can cause the PHP process to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potentially Other Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description and some of the provided content hint at the possibility of more severe impact due to the ability to read invalid memory. Although not explicitly detailed, the vulnerability could potentially be exploited for more malicious actions, such as code execution, if the attacker can control the memory accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unserialize Function:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `wddx_deserialize()` function, which takes an XML string as input and unserializes it.
*   **Malicious WDDX XML:** An attacker can craft a malicious WDDX XML document with specific attribute structures to trigger the out-of-bounds read in `php_wddx_push_element` during deserialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to cause the target PHP application to call `wddx_deserialize()` with the malicious WDDX XML. This might involve:
    *   Submitting a POST request containing the malicious XML.
    *   Interacting with a service that processes user-supplied data using `wddx_deserialize()`.
    *   Somehow manipulating existing data that will be processed by `wddx_deserialize()`.
*  No authentication or special privileges are required on the target server to trigger this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in PHP versions prior to 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11.
* The fix involves adding proper bounds checks to the code to avoid out-of-bounds reads.
* The provided content includes additional context from bug reports, source code patches, and security advisories. These resources can provide a deeper understanding of the issue and how it was resolved.
* The `strcmp()` function used in the vulnerable code is called after an increment of the loop variable, and without checking if the incremented variable is within bounds of the `atts` array, hence leading to out-of-bounds read.
* There are 4 similar out-of-bounds read issues in the same function.
