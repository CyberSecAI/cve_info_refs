This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, and while CVE-2016-7298 is mentioned in a note, it's not described. The text provides information about the following:

**Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-7263, CVE-2016-7277, CVE-2016-7289)**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Office software.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. With admin rights, the attacker could take full control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
*  **Attack vectors:**
     *   Opening a specially crafted file.
     *   Email attacks: sending the malicious file and convincing the user to open it.
     *   Web-based attacks: hosting a malicious file on a website and convincing users to visit the site and open the file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to open a specially crafted file.

**Uniscribe Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7274)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by Windows Uniscribe.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    * Web-based attacks: Attacker hosts a crafted website which a user is convinced to view.
    * File sharing attacks: Attacker provides a crafted document file and convinces a user to open it.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to view a malicious webpage or open a malicious document.

**Microsoft Office OLE DLL Side Loading Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7275)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper validation of input before loading libraries by Microsoft Office.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** DLL side-loading
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to execute a crafted application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires local access and ability to execute applications.

**Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7267)**
*  **Root cause:** Improper handling of file format parsing by Microsoft Office.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Security feature bypass.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to bypass security features, typically used in conjunction with another vulnerability (like RCE) to achieve code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Requires the user to open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to open a malicious file.

**Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7262)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper input handling by Microsoft Office
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Security feature bypass.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    * File sharing attack: Provide a malicious document, and convince the user to open it and interact by clicking a specific cell.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to open and interact with a malicious document.

**Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7266)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper checking of registry settings when running embedded content by Microsoft Office.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Security feature bypass.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
*  **Attack vectors:** File sharing attack, provide a malicious document file, and convince the user to attempt to open it multiple times.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to repeatedly attempt opening a malicious file.

**GDI Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7257)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Office, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** ASLR bypass.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to bypass ASLR, typically used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (like RCE) for code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Requires convincing a user to run a crafted application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to run a malicious application.

**Multiple Microsoft Office Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-7264, CVE-2016-7265, CVE-2016-7268, CVE-2016-7276, CVE-2016-7290, CVE-2016-7291)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of memory, leading to out-of-bounds memory reads by affected Microsoft Office software.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Allows an attacker to view out-of-bounds memory.
*   **Attack vectors:** Requires a user to open a crafted file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the user to open a malicious file.

**Microsoft (MAU) Office Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2016-7300)**
*   **Root cause:** Improper validation of updates before execution by Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) for Mac.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Elevation of Privilege.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to elevate privileges on the system by placing a crafted executable in a location used by the update application.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with existing code execution capability places a crafted executable in a specific location used by the update application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Requires the ability to execute code and place files on the system.

The document indicates that for the memory corruption vulnerabilities, a specially crafted file is required to trigger the exploit. The attack vector also includes email and web-based scenarios where the victim has to be convinced to open the file or visit a website respectively. The severity is noted as "Critical" for some vulnerabilities when preview pane is used as an attack vector. Also, some vulnerabilities can be chained with others for a successful exploit.

The provided text does not include details for CVE-2016-7298, and notes that there was an error and CVE-2016-7298 was changed to CVE-2016-7274.
