  "CVE-2016-7969": {
    "description": "The wrap_lines_smart function in ass_render.c in libass before 0.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors, related to \"0/3 line wrapping equalization.\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the `wrap_lines_smart` function in `ass_render.c`. This function is responsible for line wrapping and equalization for specific modes. An issue exists when moving a line break into a symbol, particularly if that symbol is already a break.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Out-of-bounds read",
          "Use of uninitialized memory"
        ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to an out-of-bounds read. It can also result in usage of uninitialized memory for later operations which leads to undefined behaviour.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves the way libass handles text layout and shaping, specifically mode 0/3 line wrapping equalization. Unspecified vectors are mentioned in the description, implying that crafting a specific input can trigger the vulnerability. ",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted subtitle file or stream that causes specific conditions in libassâ€™s text layout engine when it handles mode 0/3 line wrapping equalization, to trigger the out-of-bounds read or uninitialized memory usage.",
        "attacker_position": "The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by processing input (subtitle file)."
