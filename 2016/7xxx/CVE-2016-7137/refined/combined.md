Subject: Re: CVE request: Plone multiple vulnerabilities

Hi,

Re-submitting again because I forgot one of the vulnerabilities.

Multiple vulnerabilities were recently patched.

1. *filesystem information leak*: <https://plone.org/security/>
hotfix/20160830/filesystem-information-leak

Managers had the ability to find read files from the file system that the
system user running the plone process had access to

2. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone forms*: <https://plone.org/security/>
hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone-forms

z3c.form will currently accept data from GET requests when the form is
supposed to be POST. This allows a user to inject a potential XSS attack
into a form. With certain widgets in Plone admin forms, the input is
expected to be safe and can cause a reflexive XSS attack. Additionally,
there is potential for an attack that will trick a user into saving a
persistent XSS.

3. *open redirection*:  <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/open->
redirection-in-plone

In multiple places, Plone blindly uses the referer header to redirect a
user to the next page after a particular action. An attacker could utilize
this to draw a user into a redirection attack.

4. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone*: <https://plone.org/security/>
hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone-1

Plone's URL checking infrastructure includes a method for checking if URLs
valid and located in the Plone site. By passing javascript into this
specially crafted url, XSS can be achieved.

5. *Non-persistent XSS in Plone*:
<https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone>

Plone has unescaped user input in a page template that is open to XSS.

5. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone Zope Management(ZMI)*:
<https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-zope2>

In multiple places, Zope2's ZMI pages do not properly escape user input

Credits to all these go to Sebastian Perez

All of these vulnerabilities have been patched with the hotfix release
package(<https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830>) and are being
incorporated upstream.

Thanks,
Nathan

Server>/Plone/@@user-information?userid=admin<script>alert("userid")</script>

"Confirm" button is clicked

    (2) Path Traversal
    A Path traversal vulnerability was found within the application
that allows to browse filesystem files using the permissions of the
user who is running the service. The resource is only accessible by
the "admin" user

    (3) Open Redirection
    3 Instances of an open redirection were found within the
application, allowing any user to be redirected to an external website
(such as a phishing website) and therefore steal the user's
credentials

        [Vulnerable URLs and parameters]
            <Plone
Server>/Plone/%2b%2bgroupdashboard%2b%2bplone.dashboard1%2bgroup/%2b/portlets.Actions

Subject: Re: CVE request: Plone multiple vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> All of these vulnerabilities have been patched with the hotfix release
> package <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830> and are being
> incorporated upstream.

> 1. *filesystem information leak*: <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/filesystem-information-leak>
>
> Managers had the ability to find read files from the file system that the
> system user running the plone process had access to

>> By using relative paths and guessing locations on a server Plone is
>> installed on, an attacker can read data from a target server that the
>> process running plone has permission to read. The attacker needs
>> administrator privileges on the Plone site to perform this attack.

Use CVE-2016-7135.

> 2. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone forms*: <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone-forms>
>
> z3c.form will currently accept data from GET requests when the form is
> supposed to be POST. This allows a user to inject a potential XSS attack
> into a form. With certain widgets in Plone admin forms, the input is
> expected to be safe and can cause a reflexive XSS attack. Additionally,
> there is potential for an attack that will trick a user into saving a
> persistent XSS.

Use CVE-2016-7136 for the entire "accept data from GET requests when
the form is supposed to be POST" issue, which apparently has security
relevance for two different reasons ("reflexive XSS" and "saving a
persistent XSS").

> 3. *open redirection*:  <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/open-redirection-in-plone>
>
> In multiple places, Plone blindly uses the referer header to redirect a
> user to the next page after a particular action. An attacker could utilize
> this to draw a user into a redirection attack.

Use CVE-2016-7137.

> 4. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone*: <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone-1>
>
> Plone's URL checking infrastructure includes a method for checking if URLs
> valid and located in the Plone site. By passing javascript into this
> specially crafted url, XSS can be achieved.

Use CVE-2016-7138.

> 5. *Non-persistent XSS in Plone*:
> <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-plone>
>
> Plone has unescaped user input in a page template that is open to XSS.

Use CVE-2016-7139. (There were two issues numbered "5" in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/05/4> post.)

> 5. *Non-Persistent XSS in Plone Zope Management(ZMI)*:
> <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20160830/non-persistent-xss-in-zope2>
>
> In multiple places, Zope2's ZMI pages do not properly escape user input

Use CVE-2016-7140. (There were two issues numbered "5" in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/05/4> post.)
