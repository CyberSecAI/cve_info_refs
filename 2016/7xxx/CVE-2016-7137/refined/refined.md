Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-7137:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Plone uses the `referer` header in multiple places to redirect users after an action without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirection:** The application blindly trusts the `referer` header, leading to an open redirection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary external website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. Users can be tricked into visiting a malicious site by exploiting the redirection. This can also be used to steal user's credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a `referer` header pointing to a site controlled by the attacker. When the user performs an action that triggers the redirection, they are redirected to the attacker's site instead of the expected location.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with a malicious referer header.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the crafted link.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of the referer header. Specifically, the vulnerable locations include:

*   `<Plone Server>/Plone/%2b%2bgroupdashboard%2b%2bplone.dashboard1%2bgroup/%2b/portlets.Actions [referer parameter]`
*  `<Plone Server>/Plone/folder/%2b%2bcontextportlets%2b%2bplone.footerportlets/%2b/portlets.Actions [referer parameter]`
*   `<Plone Server>/Plone/login_form [came_from parameter]`
