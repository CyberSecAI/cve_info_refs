Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to a build process issue where the NCP dissector was not properly registered in Wireshark when built using CMake. This caused the dissector to fail when encountering NCP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Dissector Registration:** The NCP dissector was not being properly registered during the CMake build process.
- **Dissector Crash:** The lack of proper registration led to the NCP dissector crashing when processing NCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** Exploitation results in the crashing of the Wireshark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed NCP packet onto the network.
- **Malicious Trace File:** An attacker can provide a malformed trace file containing NCP packets that triggers the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to either be able to inject packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark or to convince a user to open a malicious trace file in Wireshark.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was specific to Wireshark version 2.2.0.
- The vulnerability was triggered by NCP packets.
- Multiple example packet capture files and crash logs were provided, which showed the issue.
- The issue was resolved in Wireshark version 2.2.1.
