# JVN#38755305 BlueZ userland utilities vulnerable to buffer overflow

## Overview

BlueZ userland utilities contain a buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* BlueZ 5.41 and earlier

## Description

BlueZ provides a Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux kernel and userland utilities.

`parse_line()` function used in some userland utilities contains a buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Impact

An attacker who can access the product may execute arbitrary code.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

# USN-4311-1: BlueZ vulnerabilities

30 March 2020

Several security issues were fixed in BlueZ.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [bluez](/security/cves?package=bluez) - Bluetooth tools and daemons

## Details

It was discovered that BlueZ incorrectly handled bonding HID and HOGP

devices. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to impersonate

non-bonded devices. ([CVE-2020-0556](/security/CVE-2020-0556))

It was discovered that BlueZ incorrectly handled certain commands. A local

attacker could use this issue to cause BlueZ to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-7837](/security/CVE-2016-7837))
