Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `kdesu` utility in `kde-cli-tools5` was vulnerable to a command injection via maliciously crafted command lines. Specifically, the issue stemmed from the lack of proper sanitization of input strings in the `kdesu` command.
*   An attacker could embed a Unicode string terminator character within the command passed to `kdesu`.
*   The `kdesu` dialog would truncate the command displayed to the user at the point of the string terminator character. However, the entire string, including the portion after the terminator, was executed with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `kdesu` utility did not properly sanitize or validate the command string before displaying it and executing it.
*   **Unicode String Terminator Bypass:** The vulnerability relied on the ability to inject Unicode characters that could be interpreted as string terminators in the display process while not interfering with the command execution.
*  **Misleading User Interface:** The `kdesu` dialog presented a truncated view of the command, potentially deceiving the user into approving actions they didn't understand.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands as root.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected system by executing malicious commands, potentially leading to data loss, system corruption, or malware installation.
*   **User Deception:** The discrepancy between the displayed command and the actual command executed made it difficult for users to identify and prevent malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** The attacker would craft a command line string containing a Unicode string terminator, followed by the malicious commands they want to execute.
*   **kdesu invocation:** The attacker would then execute this specially crafted command line using the `kdesu` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to execute `kdesu` with a crafted command-line argument
*   **Basic understanding of command-line interfaces and unicode characters:** The attacker must be aware of how `kdesu` and unicode strings are handled to craft the malicious input correctly.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved adding a check within `kdesu` to identify and reject non-printable characters (excluding the Other_Surrogate category). This ensures that users cannot inject these special characters.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `kde-cli-tools5` version 5.5.5-12.1 for SUSE Package Hub 12, 5.5.5-18.1 for openSUSE Leap 42.1, and 5.3.2-27.1 for openSUSE 13.2.
