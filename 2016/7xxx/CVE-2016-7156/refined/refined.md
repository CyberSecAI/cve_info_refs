Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `pvscsi_convert_sglist` function within the QEMU's VMware paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI) bus emulation.
- The 64-bit data length from the request descriptor was being truncated to 32 bits during the construction of the Scatter/Gather (SG) list. This truncation could lead to an infinite loop when processing large `dataLen` values, causing `chunk_size` to become zero.
- Additionally, `pvscsi_get_next_sg_elem` could be called indefinitely if an element had zero length, further contributing to the infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Truncation**: The 64-bit `dataLen` was improperly handled by truncating it to 32-bit, causing calculation errors for large values.
- **Infinite Loop**: The loop in `pvscsi_convert_sglist` could run endlessly due to the truncated length and the repeated calls to `pvscsi_get_next_sg_elem` when zero-length elements were present.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There was no limit on the number of SG elements that could be processed, allowing a malicious guest to trigger the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local, privileged user within the guest OS could trigger the infinite loop, leading to a denial of service (DoS) of the QEMU process.
- This DoS would effectively crash the QEMU process, disrupting the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local to the guest operating system.
- A malicious or compromised guest OS can craft specific SCSI commands with large data lengths or zero length SG elements.
- By sending these crafted requests to the emulated PVSCSI device, the attacker triggers the vulnerable code, leading to the infinite loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to control the guest OS.
- The attacker requires privileges within the guest OS to send specially crafted SCSI commands.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided patch limits the SG list elements to `PVSCSI_MAX_SG_ELEM` which is 2048.
- The patch also corrects the incorrect type casting which was leading to the infinite loop.
- The vulnerability is present in QEMU versions prior to 2.7.0-r3 (as indicated by the Gentoo Security Advisory).
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang from 360.cn Inc.

The information from the provided sources is consistent with the vulnerability described in the CVE, specifically the infinite loop issue in PVSCSI bus emulation. The patches and discussions provide technical details of the root cause and the fix.
