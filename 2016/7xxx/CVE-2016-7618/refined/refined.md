- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory corruption issue existed in the handling of .gcx files within the Foundation framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Opening a maliciously crafted .gcx file may lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious .gcx file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted .gcx file to the vulnerable application for processing.
