  "CVE-2016-7972": {
    "description": "The check_allocations function in libass/ass_shaper.c in libass before 0.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation failure) via unspecified vectors.",
    "affected_versions": "< 0.13.4",
    "fixed_versions": ">= 0.13.4",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the `check_allocations` function in `libass/ass_shaper.c`. It appears that there's an issue related to how memory is reallocated or managed within this function, leading to a memory allocation failure when triggered by certain inputs.",

      "Memory allocation failure"

    "impact": "Denial of service (memory allocation failure)",
