Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler for escape code `0x100010b` in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`). The handler uses a user-provided index without performing a bounds check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing bounds check:** A user-supplied index `idx` is used to calculate an offset into an array (`miniport_context_->UNKNOWN`). This offset calculation: `8 * idx + 22696` can lead to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to write to an arbitrary memory location in kernel space. The value written is either `NULL` or a pointer to a KEVENT object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** Out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash, resulting in denial of service.
- **Potential escalation of privileges:** The ability to write to arbitrary kernel memory locations could potentially be leveraged to gain higher privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User-mode interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-mode interaction with the graphics driver. Specifically by passing a malicious event handle and an index.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the NVIDIA graphics driver through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface and must have a local user account on the target system.
- The attacker needs to call `D3DKMTEscape` with a handle and an attacker-controlled index that is not validated, causing a write outside the boundaries of the intended array.

**Additional Details**
- The `ObReferenceObjectByHandle` function is used in the vulnerable code. This function first writes `NULL` to the target pointer regardless of handle validity. Then, if the handle is valid, it writes an object pointer.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Google Project Zero and a Proof of Concept was released.
