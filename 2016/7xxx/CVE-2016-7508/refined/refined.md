{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the 'SET NAMES' function in the database configuration file `inc/dbmysql.class.php` within GLPI. This function allows for specifying a character encoding for database interactions. When the database is configured to use the Big5 Asian encoding, a specific character sequence can bypass input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to improper handling of character encoding, which allows for bypassing sanitization. Specifically, when the database is configured to use the Big5 Asian encoding, a specially crafted string using the \\xBF\\x27 character can be used to bypass sanitization and inject SQL commands.",
      "Improper handling of character encoding",
	    "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to full database compromise, including reading, modifying, and deleting data. In the provided exploit, the attacker is shown to reset all user passwords to a known MD5 hash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is a remote attack vector. The vulnerability is present in multiple forms of the application. Specifically, the attack vector used in the proof of concept targeted a form input such as 'Surname' in the User profile.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated remote user. Additionally, the administrator must have configured the database to use Big5 Asian encoding by setting `$dbenc='big5'` in the `./config/config_db.php` file."
