# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Exploit Title: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in GLPI 0.90.4
# Date: 2016/09/09
# Exploit Author: Eric CARTER (in/ericcarterengineer - CS c-s.fr)
# Vendor Homepage: http://glpi-project.org
# Software Link: http://glpi-project.org/spip.php?article3
# Version: 0.90.4
# Tested on: GLPI 0.90.4 running on a Debian 7, Apache 2.2.2, MySQL 5.5.49
# CVE : CVE-2016-7508

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in GLPI 0.90.4 allow an
authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands by
using the [ELIDED] character when the database is configured to use
asian encoding (BIG 5).

> [Affected Component]
The file ./inc/dbmysql.class.php defines the encoding the database
should use. This files uses the "SET NAMES" function which offers the
possibility to use a specific encoding.

> [Attack Type]
Remote

> [Impact Code execution]
True

> [Impact Escalation of Privileges]
True

> [Impact Information Disclosure]
True

> [Prerequisite]
The administrator of GLPI must have defined the variable
$dbenc='big5' in ./config/config_db.php to support asian encoding. It
will then be possible to do SQL injection in almost all the forms of
the application.

> [Attack Vectors]
For the proof-of-concept, the attacker targeted the
"Surname" form input in the User profile by adding the characters
ø (\xBF\x27) before the SQL code (the request must be sent using Western
encoding) :
ø', password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

Once received by the server, the request will be sanitized, giving :
ø\', password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

The value will then be sent to the database with a BIG5 encoding. Here is the
critical point, as BIG5 will see the string ø\ as a single asian character
encoded on two bytes. As the single quote isn't escaped anymore, the
SQL code will be executed and will set the password of every accounts
to the value
61529519452809720693702583126814 (=MD5 hash of "ximaz" string)

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

[![@orthagh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/418844?v=4&size=48)](/orthagh)[orthagh](https://github.com/orthagh)opened [on Sep 23, 2016](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/issues/1047#issue-178877834)

[CVE-2016-7508](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vx9-fq6p-x4r8 "CVE-2016-7508")

Thanks to Eric Carter (CS)

[Attack Vectors]

Prerequisite: the administrator of GLPI must have defined the variable

$dbenc='big5' in ./config/config\_db.php to support asian encoding. It

will then be possible to do SQL injection in almost all the forms of

the application. For the proof-of-concept, the attacker targeted the

"Surname" form input in the User profile by adding the characters [ELIDED]

before the SQL code (the request must be sent using Unicode encoding)

:[ELIDED]', password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

Once received by the

server, the request will be sanitized, giving :[ELIDED]',

password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

The value will then be sent to the database with a BIG5 encoding.

Here is the critical point, as BIG5 will see the string [ELIDED]\ as a single asian character encoded on

two bytes. As the single quote isn't escaped anymore, the SQL code will

be executed and will set the password of every account to the value

61529519452809720693702583126814 (=MD5 hash of "ximaz" string)

## Description

[![@orthagh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/418844?v=4&size=48)](/orthagh)[orthagh](https://github.com/orthagh)opened [on Sep 23, 2016](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/issues/1047#issue-178877834)

[CVE-2016-7508](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vx9-fq6p-x4r8 "CVE-2016-7508")

Thanks to Eric Carter (CS)

[Attack Vectors]

Prerequisite: the administrator of GLPI must have defined the variable

$dbenc='big5' in ./config/config\_db.php to support asian encoding. It

will then be possible to do SQL injection in almost all the forms of

the application. For the proof-of-concept, the attacker targeted the

"Surname" form input in the User profile by adding the characters [ELIDED]

before the SQL code (the request must be sent using Unicode encoding)

:[ELIDED]', password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

Once received by the

server, the request will be sanitized, giving :[ELIDED]',

password=61529519452809720693702583126814 -- x

The value will then be sent to the database with a BIG5 encoding.

Here is the critical point, as BIG5 will see the string [ELIDED]\ as a single asian character encoded on

two bytes. As the single quote isn't escaped anymore, the SQL code will

be executed and will set the password of every account to the value

61529519452809720693702583126814 (=MD5 hash of "ximaz" string)
