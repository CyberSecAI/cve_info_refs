Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `Fp_toString` function located in `jsfunction.c` of the `mujs` JavaScript interpreter.
*   The issue arises from an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size when constructing a string representation of a function. Specifically, the code doesn't allocate space for the null terminator, leading to a one-byte overflow when the string is copied into the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, which occurs when writing data beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.
*   **Off-by-one error:** The root cause is an off-by-one error in the string length calculation within the `Fp_toString` function, which fails to account for the null terminator byte when allocating memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to memory corruption due to writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** By corrupting heap metadata, an attacker might be able to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Program Crash:** At a minimum, this overflow can lead to a program crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript Code:** The attack vector is through crafted JavaScript code that, when processed by `mujs`, triggers the vulnerable `Fp_toString` function. The specific trigger involves JavaScript function that has a name and parameters.
*   **String Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exposed during string construction within `Fp_toString`, which is called when converting a function object to a string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code using a vulnerable version of `mujs`.
*   **Knowledge of Trigger Condition:** The attacker needs to understand that a JavaScript function with a name and/or parameters can trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code in `jsfunction.c` allocates a buffer based on the lengths of the string "function ", the function's name, parameters, and  " { ... }", but fails to add space for the null terminator.
*   The code uses `strcpy` and `strcat` which will write one byte beyond the allocated memory.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using AddressSanitizer, which detected a heap-buffer-overflow when writing a single byte beyond the allocated buffer.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involved correcting the size calculation to include space for the terminating null byte when allocating the buffer.
