Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7633:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double `vm_deallocate` use-after-free vulnerability exists in the userspace MIG (Mach Interface Generator) code of macOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is that memory allocated for an out-of-line (OOL) memory descriptor is deallocated twice. This occurs because both the MIG handler and the `mach_msg_destroy` function attempt to deallocate the same memory, leading to a double free.
- Specifically, when a MIG handler returns an error, it is assumed that it did not take ownership of the resources associated with the message. As a result, `mach_msg_server` or `mach_msg_server_once` will call `mach_msg_destroy` to clean up. However, if the handler already deallocated the memory because it used `MACH_MSG_VIRTUAL_COPY` which signals to deallocate on return, a double free occurs when `mach_msg_destroy` also attempts to deallocate, corrupting memory.
- **Incorrect resource management:** The MIG subsystem fails to properly track ownership of OOL memory when copy type `MACH_MSG_VIRTUAL_COPY` is specified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double `vm_deallocate` leads to a use-after-free condition and memory corruption, which can cause a crash and potentially lead to a denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability's nature could potentially be escalated to arbitrary code execution with further exploitation, as memory corruption can be leveraged to gain control of program execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted mach message to a vulnerable service from a local process. This vulnerability exists in the MIG subsystem, and can affect any service that uses `mach_msg_server` or `mach_msg_server_once`
- **Mach messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `deallocate` and `copy` parameters within the Mach message's OOL memory descriptor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted Mach message to a service that uses `mach_msg_server` or `mach_msg_server_once` and handles OOL memory with a  `MACH_MSG_VIRTUAL_COPY` copy type, then returns an error.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally to interact with the vulnerable service.
- In the provided proof of concept, the `dspluginhelperd` is targeted, but the vulnerability exists in the MIG subsystem and can potentially affect other services.
- The attacker needs a good understanding of Mach messaging and the structure of MIG messages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `exploit-db.com` content provides a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the double free by sending a crafted Mach message.
*   The exploit targets the `com.apple.system.DirectoryService.legacy` service, but the description notes the issue affects numerous services due to the problematic MIG subsystem design.
*   The exploit leverages two threads to increase the chances of triggering the double free, as it's a race condition.
*   The vulnerability exists in macOS 10.12.1 (Sierra), according to the `support.apple.com` document, and is fixed in macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Security Update 2016-003 El Capitan, and Security Update 2016-007 Yosemite.
