{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Foreman form helper did not properly restrict access to associated resources when rendering lists with fewer than six items, leading to information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Inadequate access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthorized user could view the names of associated resources (like operating systems) even if they did not have permissions for those specific resources. This was limited to lists with fewer than six items.",
    "attack_vectors": "A user with permissions to create/edit a resource (like an architecture), could view unauthorized resources via the association list during the creation or edit process.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a user account with permissions to create or edit resources that have associated objects. The attacker needs no additional privileges beyond basic user access."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_versions": "Foreman 1.1 and higher, but was first mitigated against in Foreman 1.9.0 for some cases",

The list will show all possible associated resources, disclosing their names."
