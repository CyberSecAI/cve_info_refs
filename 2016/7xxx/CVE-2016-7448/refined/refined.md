{
  "CVE-2016-7448": {
    "Description": "The Utah RLE reader in GraphicsMagick before 1.3.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or large memory allocations) via vectors involving the header information and the file size.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Utah RLE reader did not validate that header information was reasonable given the file size.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation of header information against file size in the Utah RLE reader."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption or large memory allocations.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious Utah RLE file crafted to trigger large memory allocations or CPU consumption when parsed by the GraphicsMagick library."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Utah RLE file to be processed by a vulnerable version of GraphicsMagick."
  }
