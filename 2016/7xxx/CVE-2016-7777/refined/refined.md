Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Xen handles instructions related to FPU, MMX, or XMM registers in x86 HVM guests. Specifically, these instructions are supposed to trigger a "Device Not Available Exception" (#NM) when either CR0.EM or CR0.TS are set. However, if a guest modifies instructions while the hypervisor is preparing to emulate them, the #NM exception might be missed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing #NM Exception:** The core vulnerability is the potential for a missed #NM exception, which would normally prevent access to floating point unit (FPU), MMX, or XMM registers.
- **Instruction Emulation Flaw:** The vulnerability lies in a flaw in Xen's instruction emulation logic. When a guest modifies instructions just before emulation, this logic can fail to deliver the required exception, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage/Corruption:** A malicious unprivileged guest user can read or modify register state belonging to other tasks in the same VM. This can lead to the exposure or corruption of sensitive data, including cryptographic keys.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation to the host, the ability to access and manipulate data belonging to other processes in the same VM can be a crucial step in exploiting further vulnerabilities and potentially achieving privilege escalation within the VM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Instruction Modification:** The attack involves a malicious guest user modifying instructions before the hypervisor emulates them. This is done to bypass the intended exception handling mechanism.
- **Triggering Emulation:**  The vulnerability is exposed when the Xen instruction emulator is triggered.
  - In Xen 4.7 this could happen due to:
    - user mode tasks which have been given access to memory-mapped IO.
    - guests which have been migrated between systems with CPUs from different vendors
    - guests which have been configured with a CPU vendor different from the host's.
   - In Xen 4.6 and earlier, all HVM guests can trigger the emulator by attempting to execute an invalid opcode

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unprivileged Guest User:** The attacker needs to be a user within a guest VM.
- **Ability to Modify Instructions:** The attacker needs the ability to modify instructions in memory that Xen is about to execute
- **Trigger the Xen instruction emulator**: via invalid opcode, MMIO or migration between CPU vendors for Xen <= 4.7, and invalid opcode for Xen <= 4.6

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only impacts x86 HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests.
- x86 PV (Paravirtualized) and ARM guests are not affected.
- Xen versions up to 4.7 are mentioned as vulnerable, with specific triggers depending on the version.
