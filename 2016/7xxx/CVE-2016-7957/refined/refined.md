Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7957:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the Bluetooth L2CAP dissector within Wireshark. A malformed packet can cause a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies within the L2CAP dissector's parsing logic, which fails to handle malformed packets correctly, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as Wireshark will crash when processing a malformed packet. This can disrupt network analysis activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this by:
1. Injecting a malformed L2CAP packet onto the network which is captured by Wireshark.
2. Crafting a malicious packet trace file that when opened in Wireshark will trigger the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious network traffic that will be captured by Wireshark, or the ability to entice a user to open a malicious capture file. The attacker does not need specific user privileges on the target machine to cause the crash, the vulnerability resides in Wireshark's own code.
