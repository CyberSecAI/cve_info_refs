- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption in the Chakra JavaScript engine when handling objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities due to how the Chakra JavaScript engine renders objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Hosting a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability via Microsoft Edge.
    - Embedding an ActiveX control (marked "safe for initialization") in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.
    - Compromised websites, and websites that accept/host user-provided content or advertisements, containing malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted webpage or open a malicious document.
