Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2's Data Provider for SQL Server improperly handling a developer-supplied key used with the Always Encrypted feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Key Handling:** The .NET Framework was misusing the key provided by the developer, leading to incorrect encryption.
- **Information Disclosure:**  This improper handling could allow an attacker to access data that should have been protected by the Always Encrypted feature.
- **Potential Data Loss:** The misuse of the key could also lead to temporary loss of access to the encrypted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker with access to the incorrectly encrypted data could potentially decrypt it using an easily guessable key, leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires access to the incorrectly encrypted data. 
- The attacker needs to attempt to decrypt the data using a guessed or weak key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to data that was encrypted using the vulnerable .NET Framework component.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to attempt decryption using an easily guessable key.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists specifically in the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2's Data Provider for SQL Server when used with the Always Encrypted feature.
- A security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Framework handles the developer-supplied key, ensuring proper data protection.
- A workaround was available, which involved disabling Column Key Encryption by setting `SqlConnection.ColumnEncryptionKeyCacheTtl` to `TimeSpan.Zero`
