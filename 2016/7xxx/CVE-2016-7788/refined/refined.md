Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7788:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability described for CVE-2016-7788 is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability found in Exponent CMS versions 2.3.9 and earlier. The vulnerability exists because the `username` parameter in the `framework/modules/users/models/user.php` file is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `$username` parameter within the `framework/modules/users/models/user.php` file before being used in a database query. Specifically line 74 of the file is mentioned.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `username` parameter. Because it is a "blind" injection, the attacker cannot directly see the results of the query. The attacker can deduce the validity of the query by the time it takes to execute on the database.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the application's database.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the `username` parameter, which is likely used in the login or user retrieval process. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the web application that includes the malicious SQL injection within the `username` parameter. The attacker doesn't require prior authentication.
