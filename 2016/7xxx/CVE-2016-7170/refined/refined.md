Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-7170:

**CVE-2016-7170**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write in the `vmsvga_fifo_run` function within the QEMU's VMware SVGA graphics device emulation, specifically when processing the `DEFINE_CURSOR` command. The vulnerability arises from inadequate checks on the sizes of `cursor.mask[]` and `cursor.image[]` arrays when defining a cursor.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow (as stated in the MITRE description and the SUSE advisory)
    *   Out-of-bounds write leading to a QEMU process crash
    *   Insufficient bounds checking during cursor definition
    *   Memory corruption due to writing past allocated buffers

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (DoS): The out-of-bounds write leads to a QEMU process crash, disrupting the virtual machine's availability.
    *   Potential code execution: Although the provided documents don't confirm, if exploited further it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Local access within a guest OS: A privileged user inside the guest OS can send specific `DEFINE_CURSOR` commands.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Privileged access within a guest operating system.
    *   Ability to control or manipulate the cursor definition parameters sent to the QEMU virtual graphics device.

**Additional Notes:**
* The SUSE advisory notes the impact is rated as "moderate" severity.
* SUSE Bugzilla entry ID 998516 is associated with the fix
* Several SUSE Linux products and openSUSE versions were affected
* The fix primarily involves correctly validating the bitmap and pixmap sizes against the cursor array sizes to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.

The provided information aligns well with the official CVE description, offering specific code context (`vmsvga_fifo_run` function and `DEFINE_CURSOR` command) and further clarification about the attack vector (local guest OS administrator).

It's worth noting that while several sources mention "stack" based out of bounds access, the description in the MITRE database is "Heap-based buffer overflow".
