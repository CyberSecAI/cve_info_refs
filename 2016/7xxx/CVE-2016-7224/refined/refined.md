Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-7224

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows Virtual Hard Disk Driver (VHDMP) not properly handling user access to certain files when creating a new VHD.
- Specifically, when cloning a physical disk to a VHD, the driver uses `ZwOpenFile` without the `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` flag. This bypasses access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The VHDMP driver doesn't enforce proper access checks when opening physical disk drives for cloning.
- **Missing Access Control Flag:** The absence of the `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` flag in `ZwOpenFile` allows unauthorized access.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Normal users can bypass standard file system access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Physical Disk Cloning:** An attacker can clone the entire contents of a physical disk to a VHD/VHDX file, including data they shouldn't have access to.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data, such as the SAM hive, can be extracted by mounting the cloned disk.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining unauthorized access to a physical disk's contents, a normal user can gain elevated privileges or access restricted system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a malicious application that leverages the vulnerable VHDMP driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have a valid user account on the target system.
- Must be able to execute code on the system.
- No administrative privileges are initially required.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code (C#) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by creating a new VHD from a specified physical drive.
- The exploit does not bypass Bitlocker, but allows access to the underlying file system data.
- The vulnerability was reported by Google Security Research.
- Microsoft's fix involves correcting how the kernel API restricts access to these files.
