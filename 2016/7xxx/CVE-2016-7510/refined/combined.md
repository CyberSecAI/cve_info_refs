As for this issue, it looks like a local libdwarf crasher, which would make it low impact. Or is there something I have missed?   You can try to post it to oss-security mailing list or request a CVE id from Mitre.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1377015#c2)  puzzor    2016-09-22 01:30:41 UTC  ``` Use [CVE-2016-7510](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7510) for this   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1377015#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2016-09-23 08:10:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to puzzor from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1377015#c2)) > Use [CVE-2016-7510](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7510) for this  Thanks for this report!  I have filed a proper vulnerability bug at:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1378718](show_bug.cgi?id=1378718 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2016-7510 libdwarf: Out-of-bounds read in read_line_table_program")  However, this still seems to be a low impact issue in my opinion, which is why I have wontfixed it for RHEL.  Next time, be sure to contact secalert directly please.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 1378718](show_bug.cgi?id=1378718 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2016-7510 libdwarf: Out-of-bounds read in read_line_table_program") ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1377015#c4)  Tom Hughes    2016-09-26 21:32:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1378718](show_bug.cgi?id=1378718 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2016-7510 libdwarf: Out-of-bounds read in read_line_table_program") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |
