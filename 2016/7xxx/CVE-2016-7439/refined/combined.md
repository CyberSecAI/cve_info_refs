# wolfSSL 3.9.10 Vulnerability Fixes

- [September 26, 2016](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-3-9-10-vulnerability-fixes/)

wolfSSL release 3.9.10 fixes 3 medium level security vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2016-7440** The C software version of AES Encryption and Decryption in wolfSSL 3.9.8 and earlier uses a T-table based implementation where Table lookups do not properly consider cache-bank access times.  This makes it easier for a local user to discover AES keys by running a crafted application on the same machine as a victim and leveraging cache-bank timing differences.

**CVE-2016-7439** The C software implementation of RSA in wolfSSL 3.9.8 and earlier uses a different variable during squaring depending on the key state and does not properly consider cache bank monitoring.  This makes it easier for a local user to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank hit differences.

**CVE-2016-7438** The C software implementation of ECC in wolfSSL 3.9.8 and earlier uses a different variable during doubling depending on the key state and does not properly consider cache bank monitoring.  This makes it easier for a local user to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank hit differences.

VM users, hyper-threading users, and users where potential attackers have access to the CPU cache will need to update if they utilize AES, RSA private keys, or ECC private keys.

Thanks to Gorka Irazoqui Apecechea and Xiaofei Guo from Intel Corporation for the reports.
