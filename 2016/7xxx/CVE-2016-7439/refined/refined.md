Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The C software implementation of RSA in wolfSSL 3.9.8 and earlier uses a different variable during squaring depending on the key state.
*   The implementation does not properly consider cache bank monitoring.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Cache-timing side-channel vulnerability
*   Inconsistent variable usage during RSA squaring.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local user can discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same CPU core as a victim.
*   The attacker leverages cache-bank hit differences to extract key information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access to the same machine, specifically the same CPU core, as the victim.
*   Crafted application designed to exploit cache-bank timing differences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local user with the ability to run code on the same CPU core as the victim.
*   Knowledge of how to exploit cache timing differences.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of wolfSSL up to 3.9.8.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gorka Irazoqui Apecechea and Xiaofei Guo from Intel Corporation.
*   Users who utilize RSA private keys and are in environments with shared CPU resources (VMs, hyper-threading) or where attackers have access to the CPU cache are advised to update.
*  This vulnerability is related to cache timing side channel attacks.
