Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Office's improper validation of input before loading libraries. This lack of proper validation allows for a DLL side-loading attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation
- DLL side-loading

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could gain control of the affected system and execute arbitrary code.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have access to the local system.
- Malicious application: An attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious program on the system.

The provided document gives a good overview of the vulnerability and its impacts, including how an attacker might exploit the vulnerability with a malicious local program to achieve remote code execution on a victimâ€™s machine.
