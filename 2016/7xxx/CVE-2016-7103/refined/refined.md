Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2016-7103:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2016-7103 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the jQuery UI library. Specifically, the `closeText` option of the `dialog` function is vulnerable. This option, intended for customizing the close button text, does not properly sanitize user-provided input.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. If an application allows user input to populate the `closeText` option, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `closeText` option doesn't sanitize user input, allowing script tags to be embedded and executed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to a range of malicious actions including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through web applications using vulnerable versions of jQuery UI where user-controlled input can be used to set the `closeText` option of a `dialog`.
*   The injected script executes when the dialog box is displayed to a user.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the `closeText` attribute of the `dialog` function.
*   **Attacker Position:**  The attacker does not need a privileged position or access to the server. They can inject the malicious payload into the application's data via a user input or another vulnerability that affects user-supplied data.

**Additional Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   **Affected Components:** The vulnerability affects the `dialog` function within the jQuery UI library, specifically related to the handling of the `closeText` parameter.
*   **Affected Versions:** jQuery UI versions prior to 1.12.0 are susceptible.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves escaping the `closeText` option before it is passed to the button element, preventing the execution of injected JavaScript.
*   **Example:** The provided code sample demonstrates that using `<script>alert("XSS")<\/script>` within the `closeText` parameter leads to the execution of the injected JavaScript.

This vulnerability is not present in jQuery UI 1.12.0, as it was patched by escaping the `closeText` option before passing it to the button.
