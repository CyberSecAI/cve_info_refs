  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-7532",
    "description": "ImageMagick: Fix handling of corrupted psd file",
    "affected_component": "ImageMagick",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `CopyMagickMemory` function within the `MagickCore/memory.c` file. This occurs when processing a crafted PSD file that triggers an incorrect size calculation, leading to reading beyond the allocated memory region.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability could result in a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow. It is classified as having a low security impact, but it can potentially lead to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted PSD file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious PSD image file to the ImageMagick application to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": [
        "The vulnerability was found through fuzzing with afl-fuzz.",
        "The issue is located in `MagickCore/memory.c` at line 718 within the `CopyMagickMemory` function, triggered by a call stack going through `RemoveResolutionFromResourceBlock` in `coders/psd.c`.",
         "The vulnerability was reported and fixed upstream: https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/109",
         "The fix involves adding a check to ensure the count used for copying memory does not exceed the allocated memory region.",
        "The issue is triggered by writing a PSD image file which uses resource blocks with resolution information, where the count variable is calculated improperly."
