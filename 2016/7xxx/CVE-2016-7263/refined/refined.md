Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-7263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office software failing to properly handle objects in memory. This memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted but still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- This can be done through:
    - Email attacks: Sending the file as an attachment and convincing the user to open it.
    - Web-based attacks: Hosting the malicious file on a website (or compromised site) and tricking the user into visiting it and opening the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious Microsoft Office file.
- Ability to deliver this file to a target user, either through email, a website, or other file-sharing method.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**
- The document explicitly states that the vulnerability is not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of writing.
- The document is part of Microsoft Security Bulletin MS16-148, which addresses multiple vulnerabilities across different Microsoft Office products.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.
