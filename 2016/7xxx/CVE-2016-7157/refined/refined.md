Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `mptsas_config_manufacturing_1` function of the LSI SAS1068 Host Bus emulator in QEMU.
- The format string used within this function was incorrect, which could lead to an invalid memory access. Specifically, the format string `"s256"` was used instead of `"*s256"`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Format string vulnerability**: The incorrect format string allowed for writing data to memory locations that are likely out of bounds, causing a memory access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A privileged user within the guest operating system can trigger this flaw, leading to a crash of the QEMU process on the host machine.
- **Invalid memory access:** The incorrect format string leads to an attempt to write to memory locations outside the intended buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious or compromised guest operating system with a privileged user can exploit the vulnerability by triggering the vulnerable code path in `mptsas_config_manufacturing_1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged user in guest:** The attacker needs to have privileged access (e.g., root) within a QEMU guest to trigger the vulnerable function call.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Victor V of the Marvel Team, 360.cn Inc.
- Patches for this issue are available in the QEMU source code repository as:
  -  `https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-08/msg04295.html`
  -  `https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-08/msg04296.html`

- The second patch addresses an assert in the code which is related to the original issue, but is not considered to be a security issue.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory also lists this CVE as an issue fixed in `app-emulation/qemu-2.7.0-r3`.
