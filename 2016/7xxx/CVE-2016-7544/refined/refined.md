Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7544:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect usage of `_malloca` and `_freea` in Crypto++'s AES implementation when compiled with Microsoft compilers. The code allocates memory using `_malloca`, adjusts the returned pointer to a 256-byte boundary, and then, when freeing, uses `_freea` with the adjusted pointer instead of the original pointer returned by `_malloca`. This can lead to a crash or memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Pointer Tracking:** The code fails to keep track of the original memory address returned by `_malloca`, and uses an adjusted pointer for deallocation via `_freea`.
- **Use of banned function:** `alloca` was replaced with `_malloca`, which is also discouraged, and relies on special Microsoft SDLC functions.
- **Potential for memory corruption or crash:**  Freeing memory with an incorrect pointer can lead to a crash or undefined behavior, such as memory corruption, if `_malloca` uses the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the application using Crypto++, specifically the AES implementation.
- **Potential memory corruption:** Depending on the specific memory allocator implementation, exploitation can potentially lead to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the affected code path within Crypto++'s AES implementation. This is specific to Windows environments using Microsoft compilers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to use the vulnerable Crypto++ library in an application compiled with a Microsoft compiler (identified with `_MSC_VER`).
- The attacker needs to cause execution to reach the vulnerable AES implementation in the software using the library.
- No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability, other than executing code that uses Crypto++.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Crypto++ version 5.6.4, introduced by commit `823bc93357da32a3a4a2b71b9915a4e124839d18`.
- It only affects Windows platforms when using Microsoft compilers.
- The issue was resolved by fixing the pointer being passed to `_freea`, ensuring the correct original pointer is used.
- The issue was discovered during testing by John Byrd, who noticed the incorrect use of free.
- The issue was side stepped in master due to a change that avoids unaligned data access, but a user may revert to the vulnerable code path by changing settings.
