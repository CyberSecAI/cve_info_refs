Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `avi_read_seek` function in FFmpeg's AVI demuxer.
- It occurs because the function uses an incorrect `scale` value when processing an AVI file containing a crafted `strh` structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect scale value:** The core issue is the use of an incorrect scale value during the seek operation within the `avi_read_seek` function.
- **Crafted `strh` structure:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing AVI files that contain a specially crafted `strh` structure. The `strh` structure holds stream header information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Assert Fault:** This vulnerability leads to an assertion failure, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The program terminates abruptly when the incorrect scale leads to the assert failure.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious AVI file:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted AVI file. This file will have a manipulated `strh` structure.
- **File processing:** When FFmpeg attempts to process this malicious AVI file (likely as part of media playback or conversion), the incorrect scale will trigger the assert fault.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input to FFmpeg:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the specially crafted AVI file to an FFmpeg instance. This could be through direct file input, through a service that utilizes FFmpeg, or a website that processes uploaded media.
- **Knowledge of `strh` structure:** The attacker must have the knowledge to craft the `strh` data structure in a way that causes the incorrect scale value during the seek operation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information mentions a fix for this issue in the FFmpeg git repository with commit id `c8c5f66b42edc37474baa5cb51460cbf6f33075b`
- The vulnerability is present in FFmpeg versions prior to 3.1.4.
- The vulnerability is considered "remotely exploitable," meaning that a specially crafted input file is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability, and no other preconditions are necessary.
