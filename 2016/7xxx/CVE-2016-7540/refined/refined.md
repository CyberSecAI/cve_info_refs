    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted image to the `convert` tool for conversion to the RGF format.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `coders/rgf.c` file of ImageMagick. The `WriteRGFImage` function was defined to accept three parameters, but the calling function only passed two. This caused `exception` to be `NULL`, resulting in an assertion failure at line 345: `assert(exception != (ExceptionInfo *) NULL);` and program termination. The fix involved removing the extra parameter from the `WriteRGFImage` function definition and using `image->exception` instead, as is done in other coders."
