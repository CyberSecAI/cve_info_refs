  "CVE-2016-7125": {
    "Description": "ext/session/session.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 skips invalid session names in a way that triggers incorrect parsing, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary-type session data by leveraging control of a session name, as demonstrated by object injection.",
    "Root cause": "Improper validation of session names leads to incorrect parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Session Data Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary session data, including objects, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by controlling a session name."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control of a session name, which might be achievable via various attack vectors, such as manipulating request parameters."

    "Description": "The imagegammacorrect function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate gamma values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact by providing different signs for the second and third arguments.",

    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing different signs for the second and third arguments to the `imagegammacorrect` function."

    "Description": "The imagetruecolortopalette function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate the number of colors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (select\_colors allocation error and out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large value in the third argument.",

    "Root cause": "The `php_wddx_push_element` function in PHP does not handle boolean elements in a WDDX XML document correctly, leading to memory access issues.",
