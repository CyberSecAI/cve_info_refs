Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7101:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2016-7101 and describes a vulnerability in ImageMagick's SGI coder, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the SGI image coder within ImageMagick.
   - The root cause is a missing check on the number of rows in the SGI image header, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the row value is crafted to be excessively large.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The code attempts to read data from a memory location that is beyond the allocated buffer for the image pixels.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** As shown in the provided backtrace, the vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash.
   - **Potential Denial of Service:** Repeated crashes due to this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
   - **Potential Information Leakage:** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes lead to information leakage by exposing unintended data from memory.
   - The provided information does not indicate code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious SGI Image:** The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted SGI image file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SGI image file to a system using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
   - **No Special Privileges Needed:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require special privileges; it can be triggered by any user or process that utilizes the vulnerable ImageMagick library to handle images.

**7. Technical Details:**

   - The vulnerability occurs in the `ReadSGIImage` function within the `coders/sgi.c` file.
   - The crafted SGI file manipulates the row value, causing the `IdentifyImageGray` function to access memory out of the bounds of allocated buffer during image processing.
   - The fix involves adding a check for EOF and validating the header during image reading and prevent out-of-bound reads.

**8. Patches and Fixes:**

  - The issue was addressed in ImageMagick commits `7afcf9f71043df15508e46f079387bd4689a738d` and `8f8959033e4e59418d6506b345829af1f7a71127`.
  - Patched versions include imagemagick `8:6.9.5.9+dfsg-1` and `8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u5`
  
**Summary:**

CVE-2016-7101 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in ImageMagick's SGI image coder. By crafting a malicious SGI file with an excessively large row value, an attacker can cause a segmentation fault/crash, potentially leading to denial of service. The vulnerability is addressed in the listed commits and patched versions, which involve checks of the image header for a valid EOF during image processing.
