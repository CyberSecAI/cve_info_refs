Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the `ReadSUNImage` function located in the `coders/sun.c` file of the ImageMagick library. This occurs when processing a malformed or crafted SUN image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability is a classic out-of-bounds read where the program attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the `ReadSUNImage` function attempts to read a byte from a memory location that is outside the bounds of an allocated buffer.
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output from the bug report indicates a heap-buffer-overflow, confirming memory corruption due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious SUN image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or abnormal termination of the application.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes lead to information disclosure by exposing data from adjacent memory locations. However, the primary impact seems to be a crash in this case.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted SUN image file to ImageMagick for processing. This could happen through various channels:
    - Uploading a malicious image to a service that uses ImageMagick.
    - Including a malicious image in a document that is processed by ImageMagick.
    - Tricking a user to process a malicious image with an application using ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input to ImageMagick:** The attacker must be able to provide a crafted SUN image file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
- **No Privilege Required:** Based on the provided information, it appears that no special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was discovered through fuzzing with `afl-fuzz`, indicating that the vulnerability was found through automated testing techniques.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in later versions of ImageMagick.
- Red Hat has rated this issue as having Low security impact and does not plan to address this issue in future updates.
- This CVE is linked to several other related ImageMagick vulnerabilities that were identified around the same time.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs at line 499 in `coders/sun.c`.
- The ASAN output shows a heap-buffer-overflow on address 0xb2e03bd2, attempting to read 1 byte beyond the allocated region.
- The provided `sun.c_499` file in the bug report is a sample file that triggers the vulnerability.
