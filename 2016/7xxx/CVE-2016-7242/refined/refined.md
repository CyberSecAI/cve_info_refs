- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists within the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine when handling objects in memory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory within the Chakra JavaScript scripting engine.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  A user visiting a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability within the Microsoft Edge browser.
    -  An attacker embedding a malicious ActiveX control within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.
    -  Compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/advertisements may contain content that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to host or have access to a website with malicious content.
    - The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious document/application.
