The provided content is related to CVE-2016-7964.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sendRequest` method in the `HTTPClient` class within Dokuwiki does not restrict access to private networks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The lack of restrictions on the target of HTTP requests allows an attacker to send requests to internal network resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Internal port scanning: An attacker can scan ports on internal network devices by observing the response time of requests.
- Potential access to internal services: If services are exposed internally without proper authentication, an attacker may be able to interact with them, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Editing a page in Dokuwiki: An attacker can insert a crafted `ssrf` tag with a URL pointing to an internal resource, such as `ssrf{{http://127.0.0.1/log.php?ssrftest.png?recache|}}`.
- Previewing the page: When a user previews the page, the Dokuwiki server will send an HTTP request to the specified URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to edit pages in Dokuwiki.
- Knowledge of the internal network infrastructure to craft effective SSRF requests.
