Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2016-7140:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input within Zope2's ZMI (Zope Management Interface) pages. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Non-Persistent XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent (reflected) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. User input is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they visit the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could enable an attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies and hijack user sessions.
    *   Deface the affected page.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges (if the victim is an administrator).

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is executed by crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload within a vulnerable parameter. This crafted URL is then used to lure a victim into visiting it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the malicious link or otherwise access it through their browser. No user interaction on the target site is required (reflected).
*   The attacker can be a user with privileges on the ZMI pages of Zope2.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations:**

*   Multiple locations within the Zope2's ZMI pages do not properly escape user input.
*   The specific vulnerable parameter is not named, but it exists on ZMI pages of Zope2.
*   The specific URL pattern is mentioned as `<Plone Server>/Plone/@@user-information [userid parameter]` which could be the attack vector.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is patched by applying the hotfix 20160830 provided by Plone.
*   This CVE is specifically associated with XSS in Zope2's ZMI.
*   It is noted that the identified XSS flaws in  Plone's ZMI pages are non-persistent.
*   The exploit mentioned in the seclists.org content  shows the following as an example: `<Plone Server>/Plone/@@user-information?userid=admin<script>alert("userid")</script>` which shows how javascript can be injected.
