Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `framework/modules/eaas/controllers/eaasController.php` file. Specifically, the `$key` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a database query involving `$this->location_data` in `framework/core/models/expConfig.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `apikey` parameter, which is used to populate the `$key` variable and subsequently `$this->location_data`, to inject malicious SQL code. This code is then executed when the application interacts with the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify data within the database, leading to data integrity issues.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database structure and permissions, an attacker might be able to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `apikey` parameter in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to observe the server's responses to determine if their injected SQL is successful.

**Additional details from content:**
*   The vulnerable code exists in Exponent CMS versions <=2.3.9.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves escaping the user supplied input.
*  The forums provide a suggested fix: `parent::__construct($db->selectValue($this->table, 'id', "location_data='".expString::escape($this->location_data)."'"));`
