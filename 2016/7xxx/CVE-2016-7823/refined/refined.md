Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-7823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** flaw present in the WNC01WH network camera.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The device is vulnerable to stored XSS (CWE-79). This means that malicious scripts can be stored on the device itself, and later executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the device's settings.
- When a logged-in user views the settings page, these scripts are executed in the user's web browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Arbitrary script execution in the user's browser.
    - Potentially stealing sensitive information like login cookies.
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf within the context of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **adjacent**; this implies that the attacker needs to have local network access. The user accessing the web interface must be on the same network as the camera.
- A user with administrative privileges (or knowledge of the login password) to the device's settings page must be logged in when the malicious content is viewed to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable device. This would usually require administrative access to the device configuration pages or another method of modifying device settings.
- They also require that the victim is on the same network as the device and is logged in as an administrator or another user with necessary privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in firmware version 1.0.0.8 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.0.0.10 and later.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 4.3 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a moderate severity level.
