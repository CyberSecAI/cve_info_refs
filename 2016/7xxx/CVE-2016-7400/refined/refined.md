Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7400:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content confirms that the reported SQL injection vulnerabilities in Exponent CMS, fixed in commit `e916702a91a6342bbab483a2be2ba2f11dca3aa3`, are associated with CVE-2016-7400. This is explicitly stated in multiple sources, including the commit message on GitHub, the CVE assignment email from MITRE, and the Exploit-DB entry.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries. Specifically, the commit diffs show that the `injectProof` function was added to sanitize the input.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service. The vulnerable areas include:
    *   `framework/modules/addressbook/controllers/addressController.php`
    *   `framework/modules/blog/controllers/blogController.php`
    *   `framework/modules/core/controllers/expCommentController.php`
    *   Several functions in `/framework/core/subsystems/database/mysqli.php` such as `selectObjects`, `selectObjectBySql`, `selectObjectsBySql`, `selectValueBySql`, `selectObjectsIndexedArray`, `selectObject`, `insertObject`, `updateObject`, `selectArrays`, `selectArraysBySql`, `selectArray`, `selectExpObjects`, `selectExpObjectsBySql`
* The `expRouter.php` file was also modified, indicating an issue with how the router was handling input values, specifically IDs. It now converts various ID parameters to integers (`intval`).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete existing data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to gain higher privileges within the application by manipulating database records.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially perform denial of service attacks by crafting queries that consume excessive resources.
*   **Server Compromise:** In worst-case scenarios, an attacker might be able to use SQL injection as a stepping stone to further compromise the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Parameters:** Attackers can inject SQL code through vulnerable parameters in HTTP GET and POST requests.
    *   Examples include the `id` parameter in `/index.php?controller=address&action=activate_address`, the `title` parameter in `/index.php?controller=blog&action=show`, and the `content_id` parameter in `/index.php?controller=expComment&action=showComments`.
    *  The exploit-db entry shows examples of Blind SQL injection using the index.php endpoint directly: `/exponent/index.php'%20or%201%3d1--%20`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Exponent CMS instance.
*   **No Authentication Required for Some Exploits**: The Exploit-DB entry states that exploiting the index.php endpoint does not require any authentication. Other vulnerabilities in the addressbook, blog, and comment controllers could require authentication or a certain level of access, but this information is not fully detailed.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of crafting HTTP requests and injecting parameters.
*  **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.

**7. Additional Details:**
* The fix involved adding an `injectProof` method to the database classes, which sanitizes input by escaping single and double quotes.
* The `expRouter.php` file was updated to cast numeric IDs to integers via `intval()`. This helps prevent SQL injection if the vulnerable queries are expecting numeric values.
* The `expString.php` file and other files were also modified with sanitation and escaping routines, though the details of the exact vulnerabilities those modifications address for CVE-2016-7400 are not fully described.
*  The Exploit-DB entry details both Blind SQL Injection and Time Based SQL Injection as possible attack vectors.

**In summary,** CVE-2016-7400 is related to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Exponent CMS that stemmed from a lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to steal or modify data, perform denial of service, or potentially compromise the server. The vulnerabilities were fixed with the `injectProof` method and updates to the router, and were reported by Manuel Garcia Cardenas and PKAV TEAM.
