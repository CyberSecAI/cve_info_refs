Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Xen emulates HVM instructions. Specifically, when handling cache misses in the instruction cache (i-cache), the code does not properly validate if the fetched address lies within the cache boundaries before writing to it. This allows a guest to write to arbitrary hypervisor memory. This is triggered by incorrect wrapping of CS:IP in 16-bit modes by Xen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper bounds checking:**  The i-cache miss handling routine lacks a check on the address being written to, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Incorrect CS:IP wrapping:** The vulnerability is triggered by Xen incorrectly wrapping the CS:IP register in 16-bit modes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious HVM guest administrator can escalate their privileges to that of the host system.
*  This could result in complete compromise of the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a malicious HVM guest.
*  The attacker must be able to execute code within the HVM guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have administrative privileges within a HVM guest.
* The guest must be running on x86 hardware.
*   The vulnerable Xen version must be in use.
* The guest must be able to trigger the specific condition involving the CS:IP wrapping.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to HVM guests on x86 hardware.
*   PV guests and ARM guests are not affected.
*   The provided patches address the issue by preventing the incorrect CS:IP wrapping.
* The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201611-09) confirms that the vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation on the host system, and also mentions other vulnerabilities in Xen.
