Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Pritunl Client failed to validate the signature of the configuration data received from the VPN server before initiating a connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Signature Verification:** The core issue was the lack of verification of the HMAC SHA-512 signature on the configuration data. The client received configuration data signed with HMAC SHA-512, but it did not check if the signature was valid and matched the data.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability:** This lack of verification allowed for a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **VPN Hijacking:** An attacker could intercept the communication between the Pritunl client and the legitimate VPN server.
*   **Attacker-Controlled Server:** By providing a modified configuration with their own server address, the attacker could force the client to connect to a malicious VPN server controlled by them.
*   **Traffic Redirection:**  Once connected to the malicious server, all traffic from the client would be routed through the attacker's server, enabling them to eavesdrop on, modify, or manipulate the client's traffic.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** This allows for potential interception of sensitive data or injecting malicious payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the legitimate VPN server. This could be on the same network as the user or through an intermediary device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **Malicious VPN Server:** The attacker needs to have a malicious VPN server set up to accept the redirected connections.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes the fix for this vulnerability:
*   The fix adds signature verification in the `profile.js` file before updating the sync.
*   It verifies the signature by recalculating the HMAC SHA-512 signature of the data received, using the shared secret and comparing it with the signature provided in the received data.
*   The `utils.js` file is also updated to use SHA-512 instead of SHA-256 for the signature calculation.
