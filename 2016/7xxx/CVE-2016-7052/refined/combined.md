The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Regression in OpenSSL suite
Category: contrib
Module: openssl
Announced: 2016-10-10
Credits: OpenSSL Project
Affects: FreeBSD 11.0
Corrected: 2016-09-26 14:30:19 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
2016-09-26 20:26:19 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p1)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-7052
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
The OpenSSL version included in FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE is 1.0.2i. The version
has bug fix for CVE-2016-7052, which should have included CRL sanity check,
but the check was omitted.
III. Impact
Any attempt to use CRLs in OpenSSL 1.0.2i will crash with a null pointer
exception.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:27/openssl.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:27/openssl.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/11/ r306343
releng/11.0/ r306354
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

OpenSSL Security Advisory [26 Sep 2016]
========================================
This security update addresses issues that were caused by patches
included in our previous security update, released on 22nd September
2016. Given the Critical severity of one of these flaws we have
chosen to release this advisory immediately to prevent upgrades to the
affected version, rather than delaying in order to provide our usual
public pre-notification.
Fix Use After Free for large message sizes (CVE-2016-6309)
==========================================================
Severity: Critical
This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.1.0a, released on 22nd September 2016.
The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a
message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store
the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer
to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the
previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it
could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0b
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 23rd September 2016 by Robert
ÅwiÄcki (Google Security Team), and was found using honggfuzz. The fix
was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Missing CRL sanity check (CVE-2016-7052)
========================================
Severity: Moderate
This issue only affects OpenSSL 1.0.2i, released on 22nd September 2016.
A bug fix which included a CRL sanity check was added to OpenSSL 1.1.0
but was omitted from OpenSSL 1.0.2i. As a result any attempt to use
CRLs in OpenSSL 1.0.2i will crash with a null pointer exception.
OpenSSL 1.0.2i users should upgrade to 1.0.2j
The issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd September 2016 by Bruce Stephens and
Thomas Jakobi. The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development
team.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provides fixes for certain Oracle products for the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) Intel processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the [Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1) MOS note (Doc ID 2347948.1).

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 238 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [January 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2338411.1)

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2018 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2325393.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2325393.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# [R7] Nessus 6.9 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus is potentially impacted by several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (20160926) that were recently disclosed and fixed. Note that due to the time involved in doing a full analysis of each issue, Tenable has opted to upgrade the included version of OpenSSL as a precaution, and to save time. These vulnerabilities may impact Nessus and include:

* CVE-2016-6308 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6305 - OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6304 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6306 - OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* CVE-2016-6307 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-6303 - OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* CVE-2016-6329 - Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* CVE-2016-6302 - OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2179 - OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2181 - OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* CVE-2016-2182 - OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* CVE-2016-2180 - OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* CVE-2016-2178 - OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* CVE-2016-2177 - OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* CVE-2016-6309 - OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* CVE-2016-7052 - OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS

Additionally, Nessus and Tenable's managed Nessus Cloud offering were found to be impacted by an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue reported to us by Noriaki Iwasaki (CVE-2016-9260). Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us and giving us time to resolve the issue. Tenable would also like to thank JPCERT/CC for the coordination of their advisory on this issue.

Notes and caveats:

1. Nessus Agents are not affected by these issues, as they do not act as an SSL server.
2. The CVSSv2 score reflects CVE-2016-6302 and other remote DoS issues.
3. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that Nessus be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus version 6.9 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), which is not affected, and addresses the XSS issue.

To update your Nessus installation, follow these steps:

* Download the appropriate installation file to the system hosting Nessus Professional or Nessus Manager, available at the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=200>)
* Stop the Nessus service.
* Install according to your operating system procedures.
* Restart the Nessus service.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 255 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2383583.1).

The January 2018 Critical Patch Update provided patches in response to the Spectre (CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715) and Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) processor vulnerabilities. Please refer to this Advisory and the Addendum to the January 2018 Critical Patch Update Advisory for Spectre and Meltdown MOS note ([Doc ID 2347948.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2347948.1)) for information on how to obtain these patches.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  12 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Description

OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3\_srvr.c, ssl\_sess.c, and t1\_lib.c.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

For an overview of the Oracle product documentation related to this Critical Patch Update, please refer to the Oracle Critical Patch Update October 2016 Documentation Map, [My Oracle Support Note](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2162757.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org "OpenSSL Homepage").

# Overview

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

* **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347)) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9000)).
* **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.
* **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for

  + creation of key parameters
  + creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  + calculation of message digests
  + encryption and decryption
  + SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  + QUIC client tests
  + handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  + and more...

# Download

## For Production Use

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[openssl-library.org/source/](https://openssl-library.org/source/).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries "List of third party OpenSSL binaries") page on our
wiki.

## For Testing and Development

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The main OpenSSL Git repository is private.
There is a public GitHub mirror of it at [github.com/openssl/openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl "OpenSSL GitHub Mirror"),
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the GitHub mirror using

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

```

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the GitHub mirror and clone your public fork
instead.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

```

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

# Build and Install

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](/openssl/openssl/blob/master/INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.

#### Description

The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1\_lib.c, statem\_dtls.c, statem\_lib.c, and statem\_srvr.c.

ABSTRACT
TLS and SSH are two of the most commonly used proto-
cols for securing Internet traﬃc. Many of the implemen-
tations of these protocols rely on the cryptographic primi-
tives provided in the OpenSSL library. In this work we dis-
close a vulnerability in OpenSSL, aﬀecting all versions and
forks (e.g. LibreSSL and BoringSSL) since roughly October
2005, which renders the implementation of the DSA signa-
ture scheme vulnerable to cache-based side-channel attacks.
Exploiting the software defect, we demonstrate the ﬁrst pub-
lished cache-based key-recovery attack on these protocols:
260 SSH-2 handshakes to extract a 1024/160-bit DSA host
key from an OpenSSH server, and 580 TLS 1.2 handshakes
to extract a 2048/256-bit DSA key from an stunnel server.

ysis; timing attacks; cache-timing attacks; DSA; OpenSSL;

INTRODUCTION

One of the contributing factors to the explosion of the
Internet in the last decade is the security provided by the
underlying cryptographic protocols. Two of those protocols
are the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which pro-
vides security to network communication and the more spe-
cialized Secure Shell (SSH), which provides secure login to
remote hosts.

Software implementations of these protocols often use the
cryptographic primitives’ implementations of the OpenSSL
cryptographic library. Consequently, the security of these
implementations depends on the security of OpenSSL.

In this paper we present a novel side-channel cache-timing
attack against OpenSSL’s DSA implementation. The attack
exploits a vulnerability in OpenSSL, which fails to use a side-
channel-secure implementation of modular exponentiation
— the core mathematical operation used in DSA signatures.

Our attack builds upon several techniques to proﬁle the
cache memory and capture timing signals. The signals are
processed and converted into a sequence of square and mul-
tiplication (SM) operations from which we extract informa-
tion to create a lattice problem. The solution to the lattice
problem yields the secret key of digital signatures.

Flush+Reload [40] is a powerful technique to perform
cache-timing attacks. We adapt the Flush+Reload tech-
nique to OpenSSL’s implementation of DSA and, exploit-
ing properties of the Intel implementation of the x86 and
x64 processor architectures, our spy program probes rele-
vant memory addresses to create a signal trace.

We process the captured signal to get the SM sequence
performed by the sliding window exponentiation (SWE) al-
gorithm. Then we observe and analyze the number of bits
that can be extracted and used from each of those sequences.
Later, the variable amount of bits extracted from each trace
is used as input to a lattice attack that recovers the private
key.

To bridge the gap between the limited resolution of the
Flush+Reload technique [4] and the high-performance of
the OpenSSL code we apply the performance-degradation
technique of Allan et al. [4]. This technique slows the expo-
nentiation by an average factor of 20, giving a high resolution
trace and allowing us to extract up to 8 bits of information
from some of the traces.

Similar to previous works [9, 14, 21, 32], we perform a
lattice attack to recover the secret key. We use the lattice
construction of Benger et al. [9] and solve the resulting lat-
tice problem using the lattice reduction technique of Nguyen
and Shparlinski [28].

A unique feature of our work is that we target common
cryptographic protocols. Previous works that demonstrate
cache-timing key-recovery attacks only target the crypto-
graphic primitives, ignoring potential cache noise from the
protocol implementation.
In contrast, we present end-to-
end attacks on two common cryptographic protocols: SSH
and TLS. We are, therefore, the ﬁrst to demonstrate that
cache-timing attacks are a threat not only when executing
the cryptographic primitives but also in the presence of the
cache activity of the whole protocol suite.

Our contributions in this work are the following:

• We identify a security weakness in OpenSSL which
fails to use a side-channel safe implementation when
performing DSA signatures. (Section 3)

• We describe how to use a combination of the Flush+

Reload technique with a performance-degradation at-
tack to leak information from the unsafe SWE algo-
rithm. (Section 4)

• We present the ﬁrst key-recovery cache-timing attack
on the TLS and SSH cryptographic protocols. (Sec-
tion 5)

• We construct and solve a lattice problem with the side-
channel information and the digital signatures in order
to recover the secret key. (Section 6)

2. BACKGROUND

2.1 Memory Hierarchy

Accessing data and instructions from main memory is a
time consuming operation which delays the work of the fast
processors, for that reason the memory hierarchy includes
smaller and faster memories called caches. Caches improve
the performance by exploiting the spatial and temporal lo-
cality of the memory access.

In modern processors the hierarchy of caches is structured
as follows, higher-level caches, located closer to the processor
core, are smaller and faster than low-level caches, which are
located closer to main memory. Recent Intel architecture
typically has three levels of cache: L1, L2 and Last-Level
Cache (LLC).

Each core has two L1 caches, a data cache and an instruc-
tion cache, each 32 KiB in size with an access time of 4
cycles. L2 caches are also core-private and have an inter-
mediate size (256 KiB) and latency (7 cycles). The LLC is
shared among all of the cores and is a uniﬁed cache, con-
taining both data and instructions. Typical LLC sizes are
in megabytes and access time is in the order of 40 cycles.

The unit of memory and allocation in a cache is called
cache line. Cache lines are of a ﬁxed size B, which is typ-
ically 64 bytes. The lg(B) low-order bits of the address,
called line oﬀset, are used to locate the datum in the cache
line.

When a memory address is accessed, the processor checks
the availability of the address line in the top-level L1 cache.
If the data is there then it is served to the processor, a
situation referred to as a cache hit. In a cache miss, when
the data is not found in the L1 cache, the processor repeats
the search for the line in the next cache level and continues
through all the caches. Once the line is found, the processor
stores a copy in the cache for future use.

Most caches are set-associative. They are composed of S
cache sets each containing a ﬁxed number of cache lines. The
number of cache lines in a set is the cache associativity, i.e.,
a cache with W lines in each set is a W -way set-associative
cache.

Since the main memory is orders of magnitude larger than
the cache, more than W memory lines may map to the same
cache set. If a cache miss occurs and all the cache lines in
the matching cache set are in use, one of the cached lines
is evicted, freeing a slot for a new line to be fetched from
a lower-level memory. Several cache replacement policies
exist to determine the cache line to evict when a cache miss
occurs but the typical policy in use is an approximation to
the least-recently-used (LRU).

The last-level cache in modern Intel processors is inclusive.
Inclusive caches contain a superset of the contents of the

cache levels above them.
In the case of Intel processors,
the contents of the L1 and L2 caches is also stored in the
last-level cache. A consequence of the inclusion property is
that when data is evicted from the last-level cache it is also
evicted from all of the other levels of cache in the processor.
Intel architecture implements several cache optimizations.
The spatial pre-fetcher pairs cache lines and attempt to fetch
the pair of a missed line [17]. Consecutive accesses to mem-
ory addresses are detected and pre-fetched when the pro-
cessor anticipates they may be required [17]. Additionally,
when the processor is presented with a conditional branch,
speculative execution brings the data of both branches into
the cache before the branch condition is evaluated [35].

Page [30] noted that tracing the sequence of cache hits
and misses of software may leak information on the internal
working of the software, including information that may lead
to recovering cryptographic keys.

This idea was later extended and used for mounting sev-
eral cache-based side-channel attacks [10, 29, 31]. Other
attacks were shown against the L1-instruction cache [3], the
branch prediction buﬀer [1, 2] and the last-level cache [20,
22, 25, 40].

2.2 The Flush+Reload Attack

Our LLC-based attack is based on the Flush+Reload [20,
40] attack, which is a cache-based side-channel attack tech-
nique.

Unlike the earlier Prime+Probe technique [29, 31] that
detects activity in cache sets, the Flush+Reload technique
identiﬁes access to memory lines, giving it a higher resolu-
tion, a high accuracy and high signal-to-noise ratio.

Like Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload relies on cache shar-
ing between processes. Additionally, it requires data shar-
ing, which is typically achieved through the use of shared
libraries or using page de-duplication [6, 36].

A round of the attack, which identiﬁes victim access to
a shared memory line, consists of three phases. (See Algo-
rithm 1.) In the ﬁrst phase the adversary evicts the mon-
itored memory line from the cache.
In the second phase,
the adversary waits a period of time so the victim has an
opportunity to access the memory line. In the third phase,
the adversary measures the time it takes to reload the mem-
ory line. If during the second phase the victim accesses the
memory line, the line will be available in the cache and the
reload operation in the third phase will take a short time. If,
on the other hand, the victim does not access the memory
line then the third phase takes a longer time as the memory
line is loaded from main memory.

Algorithm 1: Flush+Reload Attack
Input: Memory Address addr.
Result: True if the victim accessed the address.

begin

flush(addr )
Wait for the victim.
time ← current_time()
tmp ← read(addr )
readTime ← current_time() - time
return readTime < threshold

The execution of the victim and the adversary processes
are independent of each other, thus synchronization of prob-

ing is important and several factors need to be considered
when processing the side-channel data. Some of those fac-
tors are the waiting period for the adversary between probes,
memory lines to be probed, size of the side-channel trace and
cache-hit threshold. One important goal for this attack is to
achieve the best resolution possible while keeping the error
rate low and one of the ways to achieve this is by targeting
memory lines that occur frequently during execution, such
as loop bodies. Several processor optimizations are in place
during a typical process execution and an attacker must be
aware of these optimizations to ﬁlter them during the anal-
ysis of the attack results. See [4, 39, 40] for discussions of
some of these parameters.

A typical implementation of the Flush+Reload attack
makes use of the clflush instruction of the x86 and x64
instruction sets. The clflush instruction evicts a speciﬁc
memory line from all the cache hierarchy and being an un-
privileged instruction, it can be used by any process.

The inclusiveness of the LLC is essential for the Flush+
Reload attack. Whenever a memory line is evicted from
the LLC, the processor also evicts the line from all of the L1
and L2 caches. On processors that do not have an inclusive
LLC, e.g., AMD processors, the attack does not work [40].
See, however, Lipp et al. [24] for a variant of the technique
that does not require an inclusive LLC.

2.3 The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

A variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, DSA was ﬁrst
proposed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). DSA uses the multiplicative group of a
ﬁnite ﬁeld. We use the following notation for DSA.
Parameters: Primes p, q such that q divides (p − 1), a gen-
erator g of multiplicative order q in GF (p) and an approved
hash function h (e.g. SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512).
Private-Public key pairs: The private key α is an integer
uniformly chosen such that 0 < α < q and the corresponding
public key y is given by y = gα mod p. Calculating the
private key given the public key requires solving the discrete
logarithm problem and for correctly chosen parameters, this
is an intractable problem.
Signing: A given party, Alice, wants to send a signed mes-
sage m to Bob—the message m is not necessarily encrypted.
Using her private-public key pair (αA, yA), Alice performs
the following steps:

1. Select uniformly at random a secret nonce k such that

0 < k < q.

2. Compute r = (gk mod p) mod q and h(m).

3. Compute s = k−1(h(m) + αAr) mod q.

4. Alice sends (m, r, s) to Bob.

Verifying: Bob wants to be sure the message he received
comes from Alice—a valid DSA signature gives strong evi-
dence of authenticity. Bob performs the following steps to
verify the signature:

1. Reject the signature if it does not satisfy 0 < r < q

and 0 < s < q.

2. Compute w = s−1 mod q and h(m).

3. Compute u1 = h(m)w mod q and u2 = rw mod q.

4. Compute v = (gu1 yu2

A mod p) mod q.

5. Accept the signature if and only if v = r holds.

2.3.1 DSA in Practice

Putting it mildly, there is no consensus on key sizes, and
furthermore keys seen in the wild and used in ubiquitous
protocols have varying sizes—sometimes dictated by existing
and deployed standards. For example, NIST deﬁnes 1024-bit
p with 160-bit q as “legacy-use” and 2048-bit p with 256-bit
q as “acceptable” [8]. We focus on these two parameter sets.
SSH’s Transport Layer Protocol1 lists DSA key type ssh-
dss as “required” and deﬁnes r and s as 160-bit integers,
implying 160-bit q. In fact the OpenSSH tool ssh-keygen
defaults to 160-bit q and 1024-bit p for these key types, not
allowing the user to override that option, and using the same
It is worth
parameters to generate the server’s host key.
noting that recently as of version 7.0, OpenSSH disables
host server DSA keys by a conﬁgurable default option2, but
of course this does not aﬀect already deployed solutions.

As a countermeasure to previous timing attacks, Open-
SSL’s DSA implementation pads nonces by adding either q
or 2q to k—see details in Section 3.

For the DSA signing algorithm, Step 2 is the performance
bottleneck and the exponentiation algorithm used will prove
to be of extreme importance when we later collect our side-
channel information in Section 4.

2.4 Sliding Window Exponentiation

Sliding window exponentiation (SWE) is a widely imple-
mented software method to perform integer exponentiations,
e.g. featured alongside other methods in the OpenSSL code-
base. SWE is fairly popular due to its performance since it
reduces the amount of pre-computation needed and, more-
over, reduces the average amount of multiplications per-
formed during the exponentiation.

An exponent e is represented and processed as a sequence
of windows ei, each of length L(ei) bits. Processing the
exponent in windows reduces the amount of multiplications
at the cost of increased memory utilization since a table of
pre-computed values is used.

A window ei can be a zero window represented as a string
of “0”s or non-zero window represented as a string starting
and ending with “1”s and such window is of width w (de-
termined in OpenSSL by the size in bits of the exponent e).
The length of non-zero windows satisfy 1 ≤ L(ei) ≤ w, thus
the value of any given non-zero window is an odd number
between 1 and 2w − 1.

As mentioned before, the algorithm pre-computes values
and stores them in a table to be used later during multipli-
cation operations. The multipliers computed are bv mod m
for each odd value of v where 1 ≤ v ≤ 2w − 1 and these
values are stored in table index g[i] where i = (v − 1)/2. For
example, with the standard 160-bit q size, OpenSSL uses a
window width w = 4, the algorithm pre-computes multipli-
ers b1, b3, b5, ..., b15 mod m and stores them in g[0], g[1], g[2],
..., g[7], respectively.

Using the SWE representation of the exponent e, Algo-
rithm 2 computes the corresponding exponentiation through
a combination of squares and multiplications in a left-to-
right approach. The algorithm scans every window ei from

return r;

the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) to the least signiﬁcant bit
(LSB).

For any window, a square operation is executed for each
bit and additionally for a non-zero window, the algorithm
executes an extra multiplication when it reaches the LSB of
the window.

For novel reasons explained later in Section 3, the side-
channel part of our attack focuses on this algorithm. Specif-
ically, in getting the sequence of squares and multiplies per-
formed during its execution. Then we extract partial infor-
mation from the sequence for later use in the lattice attack.

2.5 Partial key disclosure

Recall that the nonce k and the secret key α satisfy the

following linear congruence.

s = k−1(h(m) + αr) mod q

The constants of the linear combination are speciﬁed by
s, h(m), and r, which, typically for a signed message, are all
public. Hence, knowing the nonce k reveals the secret key
α.

Typically, side-channel leakage from SWE only recovers
partial information about the nonce. The adversary, there-
fore, has to use that partial information to recover the key.
The usual technique for recovering the secret key from the
partial information is to express the problem as a hidden
number problem [12] which is solved using a lattice tech-
nique.

2.5.1 The hidden number problem

In the hidden number problem (HNP) the task is to ﬁnd a
hidden number given some of the MSBs of several modular
linear combinations of the hidden number. More speciﬁcally,
the problem is to ﬁnd a secret number α given a number of
triples (ti, ui, (cid:96)i) such that for vi = |α · ti − ui|q we have
|vi| ≤ q/2(cid:96)i+1, where | · |q is the reduction modulo q into the
range (−q/2, . . . , q/2).

Boneh and Venkatesan [12] initially investigate HNP with
a constant (cid:96)i = (cid:96). They show that for (cid:96) < log1/2 q + log log q
and random ti, the hidden number α can be recovered given
a number of triples linear in log q.

Howgrave-Graham and Smart [21] extend the work of

Boneh and Venkatesan [12] showing how to construct an
HNP instance from leaked LSBs and MSBs of DSA nonces.
Nguyen and Shparlinski [27] prove that for a good enough
hash function and for a linear number of randomly chosen
nonces, knowing the (cid:96) LSBs of a certain number of nonces,
the (cid:96) + 1 MSBs or 2 · (cid:96) consecutive bits anywhere in the
nonces is enough for recovering the long term key α. They
further demonstrate that a DSA-160 key can be broken if
only the 3 LSBs of a certain number of nonces are known.
Nguyen and Shparlinski [28] extend the results to ECDSA,
and Liu and Nguyen [26] demonstrate that only 2 LSBs are
required for breaking a DSA-160 key. Benger et al. [9] ex-
tend the technique to use a diﬀerent number of leaked LSBs
for each signature.

2.5.2 Lattice attack

To ﬁnd the hidden number from the triples we solve a
lattice problem. The construction of the lattice problem
presented here is due to Benger et al. [9], and is based on
the constructions in earlier publications [12, 27].

Given d triples, we construct a d + 1-dimensional lattice

using the rows of the matrix








B =

2(cid:96)1+1 · q

2(cid:96)1+1 · t1

. . .

. . .

2(cid:96)d+1 · q
2(cid:96)d+1 · td








.

1

By the deﬁnition of vi, there are integers λi such that
vi = λi · q + α · ti − ui. Consequently, for the vectors x =
(λ1, . . . , λd, α), y = (2(cid:96)1+1 · v1, . . . , 2(cid:96)d+1 · vd, α) and u =
(2(cid:96)1+1 · u1, . . . , 2(cid:96)d+1 · ud, 0) we have

x · B − u = y.

√

The 2-norm of the vector y is about

d + 1 · q whereas
the determinant of the lattice L(B) is 2d+(cid:80) li · qd. Hence y
is a short vector in the lattice and the vector u is close to
the lattice vector x · B. We can now solve the Closest Vector
Problem (CVP) with inputs B and u to ﬁnd x, revealing the
value of the hidden number α.

2.5.3 Related Work

Several authors describe attacks on cryptographic systems
that exploit partial nonce disclosure to recover long-term
private keys.

Brumley and Hakala [14] use an L1 data cache-timing at-
tack to recover the LSBs of ECDSA nonces from the dgst
command line tool in OpenSSL 0.9.8k. They collect 2,600
signatures (8K with noise) and use the Howgrave-Graham
and Smart [21] attack to recover a 160-bit ECDSA private
key. In a similar vein, Acıi¸cmez et al. [3] use an L1 instruc-
tion cache-timing attack to recover the LSBs of DSA nonces
from the same tool in OpenSSL 0.9.8l, requiring 2,400 sig-
natures (17K with noise) to recover a 160-bit DSA private
key. Both attacks require HyperThreading architectures.

Brumley and Tuveri [15] mount a remote timing attack on
the implementation of ECDSA with binary curves in Open-
SSL 0.9.8o. They show that the timing leaks information on
the MSBs of the nonce used and that after collecting that
information over 8,000 TLS handshakes the private key can
be recovered.

Benger et al. [9] recover the secret key of OpenSSL’s EC-
DSA implementation for the curve secp256k1 using less than

256 signatures. They use the Flush+Reload technique to
ﬁnd some LSBs of the nonces and extend the lattice tech-
nique of Howgrave-Graham and Smart [21] to use all of the
leaked bits rather than limiting to a ﬁxed number.

Van de Pol et al. [32] exploit the structure of the modulus
in some elliptic curves to use all of the information leaked
in consecutive sequences of bits anywhere in the top half of
the nonces, allowing them to recover the secret key after ob-
serving only a handful of signatures. Allan et al. [4] improve
on these results by using a performance-degradation attack
to amplify the side-channel. The ampliﬁcation allows them
to observe the sign bit in the wNAF representation used in
OpenSSL 1.0.2a and to recover a 256 bit key after observing
only 6 signatures.

Genkin et al. [19] perform electromagnetic and power anal-
ysis attacks on mobile phones. They show how to construct
HNP triples when the signature uses the low s-value [38].

3. A NEW SOFTWARE DEFECT

Percival [31] demonstrated that the SWE implementation
of modular exponentiation in OpenSSL version 0.9.7g is vul-
nerable to cache-timing attacks, applied to recover RSA pri-
vate keys. Following the issue, the OpenSSL team com-
mitted two code changes relevant to this work. The ﬁrst3
adds a “constant-time” implementation of modular exponen-
tiation, with a ﬁxed-window implementation and using the
scatter-gather method [13, 41] of masking table access to the
multipliers.

The new implementation is slower than the original SWE
implementation. To avoid using the slower new code when
the exponent is not secret, OpenSSL added a ﬂag (BN_FLG_-
CONSTTIME) to its representation of big integers. When the
exponent should remain secret (e.g. in decryption and sign-
ing) the ﬂag is set (e.g. in the case of DSA nonces, Figure 1,
Line 252) at runtime and the exponentiation code takes the
“constant-time” execution path (Figure 2, Line 413). Oth-
erwise, the original SWE implementation is used.

The execution time of the “constant-time” implementation
still depends on the bit length of the exponent, which in the
case of DSA should be kept secret [12, 15, 27]. The second
commit4 aims to “make sure DSA signing exponentiations
really are constant-time” by ensuring that the bit length of
the exponent is ﬁxed. This safe default behavior can be dis-
abled by applications enabling the DSA_FLAG_NO_EXP_CON-
STTIME ﬂag at runtime within the DSA structure, although
we are not aware of any such cases.

To get a ﬁxed bit length, the DSA implementation adds γq
to the randomly chosen nonce, where γ ∈ {1, 2}, such that
the bit length of the sum is one more than the bit length of
q. More precisely, the implementation creates a copy of the
nonce k (Figure 1, Line 264), adds q to it (Line 274), checks
if the bit length of the sum is one more than that of q (Line
276), otherwise it adds q again to the sum (Line 277). If q
is n bits, then k + q is either n or n + 1 bits. In the former
case, indeed k + 2q is n + 1 bits. As an aside, we note the
code in question is not constant-time and potentially leaks
the value of γ. Such a leak would create a bias that can be
exploited to mount the Bleichenbacher attack [5, 11, 18].

0ebfcc8f92736c900bae4066040b67f6e5db8edb

While the procedure in this commit ensures that the bit
length of the sum kq is ﬁxed, unfortunately it introduces a
software defect. The function BN_copy is not designed to
propagate ﬂags from the source to the destination. In fact,
OpenSSL exposes a distinct API BN_with_flags for that
functionality—quoting the documentation:

BN_with_flags creates a temporary shallow copy
of b in dest . . . Any ﬂags provided in flags will
be set in dest in addition to any ﬂags already set
in b. For example this might commonly be used
to create a temporary copy of a BIGNUM with
the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME ﬂag set for constant time
operations.

In contrast, with BN_copy the BN_FLG_CONSTTIME ﬂag does
not propagate to kq. Consequently, the sum is not treated
as secret, reverting the change made in the ﬁrst commit—
when the exponentiation wrapper subsequently gets called
(Figure 1, Line 285), it fails the security-critical branch. Fol-
lowing a debug session in Figure 2, indeed the ﬂag (explicit
value 0x4) is not set, and the execution skips the call to BN_-
mod_exp_mont_consttime and instead continues with the in-
secure SWE code path for DSA exponentiation.

In addition to testing our attack against OpenSSL (1.0.2h),
we reviewed the code of two popular OpenSSL forks: Li-
breSSL5 and BoringSSL6. Using builds with debugging sym-
bols, we conﬁrm both LibreSSL7 and BoringSSL8 share the
same defect. It is worth noting that BoringSSL stripped out
TLS DSA cipher suites in late 20149.

4. EXPLOITING THE DEFECT

In this section we describe how we use and combine the
Flush+Reload technique with a performance degradation
technique [4] to attack the OpenSSL implementation of DSA.
We tested our attack on an Intel Core i5-4570 Haswell
Quad-Core 3.2GHz (22nm) with 16GB of memory running
64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS “Trusty”. Each core has an 8-way
32KB L1 data cache, an 8-way 32KB L1 instruction cache,
an 8-way 256KB L2 uniﬁed cache, and all the cores share a
12-way 6MB uniﬁed LLC (all with 64B lines). It does not
feature HyperThreading.

We used our own build of OpenSSL 1.0.2h which is the
same default build of OpenSSL but with debugging symbols
on the executable. Debugging symbols facilitate mapping
source code to memory addresses but they are not loaded
during run time, thus the victim’s performance is not af-
fected. Debugging symbols are, typically, not available to
attackers but using reverse engineering techniques [16] is
possible to map source code to memory addresses.

As previously discussed in Section 2.5, for DSA-type sig-
natures, knowing a few bits of suﬃciently many signature
nonces allows an attacker to recover the secret key. This
is the goal of our attack: we trace and recover side-channel
information of the SWE algorithm that reveals the sequence

Figure 2: Debugging OpenSSL DSA signing in
crypto/bn/bn_exp.c. The Line 413 branch is not
taken since BN_FLG_CONSTTIME is not set, as seen from
the print command outputs. Hence BN_mod_exp_-
mont_consttime is not called— the control ﬂow con-
tinues with classical SWE code.

of squares and multiplications, from that sequence we re-
cover a few bits that we use for the lattice attack described
in Section 6.

As seen in Figure 2, every time OpenSSL performs a DSA
signature, the exponentiation method BN_mod_exp_mont in
crypto/bn/bn_exp.c gets called. There, the BN_FLG_CONST-
TIME ﬂag is checked but due to the software defect discussed
in Section 3 the condition fails and the routine continues
with the SWE pre-computation and then the actual expo-
nentiation. For the ﬁnite ﬁeld operations, BN_mod_exp_mont
calls BN_mod_mul_montgomery in crypto/bn/bn_mont.c and
from there, the multiply wrapper bn_mul_mont is called,
where, by default for x64 targets, assembly code is executed
to perform low level operations using BIGNUMs for square
and multiplication. OpenSSL uses Montgomery represen-
tation for eﬃciency. Note that for other platforms and/or
non-default build conﬁgurations, the actual code executed
ranges from pure C implementation to entirely diﬀerent as-
sembly. The attacker can easily adapt to these diﬀerent
execution paths, but the discussion that follows is geared
towards our target platform.

The threshold set for the load time in the Flush+Reload
technique (cache hit vs. cache miss) is system and software
dependent. From our measurements we set this threshold
accordingly since the load times from LLC and from memory
were clearly deﬁned. Figure 4 shows that loads from LLC
take less that 100 cycles, while loads from main memory
take more than 200 cycles.

As mentioned before, to get better resolution and gran-
ularity during the attack one eﬀective strategy is to tar-
get body loops or routines that are invoked several times.
For that reason we probe, using the Flush+Reload tech-
nique, inner routines used for square and multiply. Since
squares can be computed more eﬃciently than multiplica-
tion, OpenSSL’s multiply wrapper checks if the two pointer
operands are the same and, if so, calls to assembly squar-
ing code (bn_sqr8x_mont)—otherwise, to assembly multiply
code (bn_mul4x_mont).

At the same time we run a performance degradation at-
tack, ﬂushing actively used memory addresses during these
routines (e.g. assembly labels Lsqr4x_inner and Linner4x,
respectively). We slow down the execution time to a safe,
but not noticeable by the victim, threshold that ensures a
good trace by our spy program. In our experiments, we ob-
serve slow down factors of roughly 16 and 26 for 1024-bit and
2048-bit DSA, respectively due to the degrade technique.

Using this strategy, our spy program collects data from
two channels: one for square latencies and the other for
multiply latencies. We then apply signal processing tech-
niques to this raw channel data. A moving average ﬁlter on
the data results in Figure 3 and Figure 4 for 1024-bit and
2048-bit DSA, respectively. There is a signiﬁcant amount
of information to extract from these signals on the SWE
algorithm state transitions and hence exponent bit values.
Generally, extracted multiplications yield a single bit of in-
formation and the squares yield the position for these bits.
Some short examples follow.

Stepping through Figure 3, the initial low amplitude for
the multiply signal is the multiplication for converting the
base operand to Montgomery representation. The subse-
quent low amplitude for the square signal is the temporary
square value used to build the odd powers for the SWE pre-
computation table (i.e. s in Algorithm 2). The subsequent

long period of low multiply amplitude is the successive mul-
tiplications to build the pre-computation table itself. Then
begins the main loop of SWE. As an upward sloping multiply
amplitude intersects a downward sloping square amplitude,
this marks the transition from a multiplication operation to
a square operation (and vice versa). This naturally occurs
several times as the main exponentiation loop iterates. The
end of this particular signal shows a ﬁnal transition from
multiply to a single square, indicating that the exponent is
even and the two LSBs are 1 and 0.

Stepping through Figure 4 is similar, yet the end of this
particular signal shows a ﬁnal transition from square to
multiply—indicating that the exponent is odd, i.e. the LSB
is 1.

Even when employing the degrade technique, it is impor-
tant to observe the vast granularity diﬀerence between these
two cryptographic settings. On average, a 2048-bit signal is
roughly ten times the length of a 1024-bit signal, even when
the exponent is only 60% longer (i.e. 256-bit vs. 160-bit).
This generally suggests we should be able to extract more
accurate information from 2048-bit signals than 1024-bit—
i.e., the higher security cryptographic parameters are more
vulnerable to side-channel attack in this case. See [37, 39, 40]
for similar examples of this phenomenon.

Granularity is vital to determining the number of squares
interleaved between multiplications. Since, in our environ-
ment, there appears to be no reliable indicator in the signal
for transitions from one square to the next, we estimate the
number of adjacent squares by the horizontal distance be-
tween multiplications. Since the channel is latency data, we
also have reference clock cycle counter values so another es-
timate is based on the counter diﬀerences at these points.
Our experiments showed no signiﬁcant advantage of one ap-
proach over the other.

Extracting the multiplications from the signal and inter-
leaving them with a number of consecutive squares propor-
tional to the width of the corresponding gap gives us the
square and multiplication sequence, or SM sequence, that
the SWE algorithm passed through. Figure 7 shows an ex-
ample of an SM sequence recorded by the spy program when
OpenSSL signs using 2048-bit DSA.

Our spy program is able to capture most of the SM se-
quence accurately. It can miss or duplicate a few squares
due to drift but is able to capture all of the multiplication
operations. Closer to the LSBs, the information extracted
from the SM sequence is more reliable since the bit position
is lost if any square operation is missed during probing.

5. VICTIMIZING APPLICATIONS

The defect from the previous section is in a shared library.
Potentially any application that links against OpenSSL for
DSA functionality can be aﬀected by this vulnerability. But
to make our attack concrete, we focus on two ubiquitous
protocols and applications: TLS within stunnel and SSH
within OpenSSH.

As we discuss later in Section 6, the trace data alone is
not enough for private key recovery—we also need the digital
signatures themselves and (hashed) messages. To this end,
the goal of this section is to describe the practical tooling
we developed to exploit the defect within these applications,
collecting both trace data and protocol messages.

5.1 Attacking TLS

To feature TLS support, one option for network applica-
tions that do not natively support TLS communication is
to use stunnel10, a popular portable open source software
package that forwards network connections from one port
to another and provides a TLS wrapper. A typical stun-
nel use case is listening on a public port to expose a TLS-
enabled network service, then connecting to a localhost port
where a non-TLS network service is listening—stunnel pro-
vides a TLS layer between the two ports. It links against
the OpenSSL shared library to provide this functionality.
For our experiments, we used stunnel 5.32 compiled from
stock source and linked against OpenSSL 1.0.2h. We gener-
ated a 2048-bit DSA certiﬁcate for the stunnel service and
chose the DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256 TLS 1.2 cipher suite.

We wrote a custom TLS client that connects to this stun-
nel service. It launches our spy to collect the timing signals,
but its main purpose is to carry out the TLS handshake and
collect the digital signatures and protocol messages. Fig-
ure 5 shows the TLS handshake. Relevant to this work, the
initial ClientHello message contains a 32-byte random ﬁeld,
and similarly the server’s ServerHello message. In practice,
these are usually a 4-byte UNIX timestamp concatenated
with a 28-byte nonce. The Certificate message contains
the DSA certiﬁcate we generated for the stunnel service. The
ServerKeyExchange message contains a number of critical
ﬁelds for our attack: Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange parame-
ters, the signature algorithm and hash function identiﬁers,
and ﬁnally the digital signature itself in the signed_params
ﬁeld. Given our stunnel conﬁguration and certiﬁcate, the
2048-bit DSA signature is over the concatenated string

ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random +
ServerKeyExchange.params

and the hash function is SHA-512, both dictated by the
SignatureAndHashAlgorithm ﬁeld (explicit values 0x6, 0x2).
Our client saves the hash of this string and the DER-encoded
digital signature sent from the server. All subsequent mes-
sages, including ServerHelloDone and any client responses,
are not required by our attack. Our client therefore drops
the connection at this stage, and repeats this process sev-
eral hundred times to build up a set of distinct trace, digital
signature, and digest tuples. See Section 6 for our explicit
attack parameters. Figure 4 is a typical signal extracted by
our spy program in parallel to the handshake between our
client and the victim stunnel service.

5.2 Attacking SSH

OpenSSH11 is a suite of tools whose main goal is to provide
secure communications over an insecure channel using the
SSH network protocol.

OpenSSH is linked to the OpenSSL shared library to per-
form several cryptographic operations, including digital sig-
natures (excluding ed25519 signatures). For our experi-
ments we used the stock OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 binary pack-
age from the Ubuntu repository, and pointed the run-time
shared library loader at OpenSSL 1.0.2h. The DSA key pair
used by the server and targeted by our attack is the default
1024-bit key pair generated during installation of OpenSSH.
Similar to Section 5.1, we wrote a custom SSH client that

Figure 4: Complete ﬁltered trace of a 2048-bit DSA sign operation during an stunnel TLS 1.2 handshake.

launches our spy program, the spy program collects the tim-
ing signals during the handshake. At the same time it per-
forms an SSH handshake where the protocol messages and
the digital signature are collected for our attack.

Relevant to this work, the SSH protocol deﬁnes the Diﬃe-
Hellman key exchange parameters in the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT
message, along with the signature algorithm and the hash
function identiﬁers. Additionally a 16-byte random nonce is
sent for host authentication by the client and the server.

The SSH_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY message contains the server’s
public key (used to create and verify the signature), server’s
DH public key f (used to compute the shared secret K in
combination with the client’s DH public key e) and the sig-
nature itself. Figure 6 shows the SSH handshake with the
critical parameters sent in every message relevant for the
attack. To be more precise, the signature is over the SHA-1
hash of the concatenated string

ClientVersion + ServerVersion +
Client.SSH_MSG_KEXINIT + Server.SSH_MSG_KEXINIT +
Server.publicKey + minSize + prefSize + maxSize +
p + g + e + f + K

As the key exchange12 and public key parameters, our
SSH client was conﬁgured to use diffie-hellman-group-
-exchange-sha1 and ssh-dss respectively. Note that two
diﬀerent hashing functions may be used, one hash function
for key derivation following Diﬃe-Hellman key exchange and
another hash function for the signing algorithm, which for
DSA is the SHA-1 hash function.

Similarly to the TLS case, our client saves the hash of
the concatenated string and the digital signature raw bytes
sent from the server. All subsequent messages, including
SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS and any client responses, are not required
by our attack. Our client therefore drops the connection at
this stage, and repeats this process several hundred times to

12https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4419

build up a set of distinct trace, digital signature, and digest
tuples. See Section 6 for our explicit attack parameters.
Figure 3 is a typical signal extracted by our spy program in
parallel to the handshake between our client and the victim
SSH server.

5.3 Observations

These two widely deployed protocols share many similar-
ities in their handshakes regarding e.g. signaling, content of
messages, and security context of messages. However, in the
process of designing and implementing our attacker clients
we observe a subtle diﬀerence in the threat model between
the two. In TLS, all values that go into the hash function to
compute the digital signature are public and can be observed
(unencrypted) in various handshake messages. In SSH, most
of the values are public—the exception is the last input to
the hash function: the shared DH key. The consequence
is side-channel attacks against TLS can be passive, listen-
ing to legitimate handshakes not initiated by the attacker
yet collecting side-channel data as this occurs. In SSH, the
attacker must be active and initiate its own handshakes—
without knowing the shared DH key, a passive attacker can-
not compute the corresponding digest needed later for the
lattice stage of the attack. We ﬁnd this innate protocol
level side-channel property to be an intriguing feature, and
a factor that should be carefully considered during protocol
design.

6. RECOVERING THE PRIVATE KEY

In previous sections we showed how our attack can re-
cover the sequence of square and multiply operations that
the victim performs. We further showed how to get the sig-
nature information matching each sequence for both SSH
and TLS. We now turn to recovering the private key from
the information we collect.

The scheme we use is similar to past works. We ﬁrst

use the side-channel information we capture to collect in-
formation on the nonce used in each signature. We use the
information to construct HNP instances and use a lattice
technique to ﬁnd the private key. Further details on each
step are provided below.

6.1 Extracting the least signiﬁcant bits

In Section 4 we showed how we collect the SM sequences
of each exponentiation. From every SM sequence, we extract
a few LSBs to be used later in the lattice attack. To that
end, Table 1 contains our empirical accuracy statistics for
various relevant patterns trailing the SM sequences, and fur-
thermore not for the SWE in isolation but rather in the con-
text of OpenSSL DSA executing in real world applications
(TLS via stunnel, SSH via OpenSSH), as described above
in Section 5. All of these patterns correspond to recovering
a = ¯k mod 2(cid:96) for an exponent ¯k. From these ﬁgures, we
note two trends. (1) The accuracy decreases as (cid:96) increases
due to deviation in the square operation width. Yet weighed
with the exponentially decreasing probability of the longer
patterns, the practical impact diminishes. (2) As expected,
we generally obtain more accurate results with 2048-bit vs.
1024-bit due to granularity. These numbers show that, ex-
ploiting our new software defect and leveraging the tech-
niques in Section 4, we can recover a with extremely high
probability.

6.2 Lattice attack implementation

Recall that to protect against timing attacks OpenSSL
uses an exponent ¯k equivalent to the randomly selected nonce
k. ¯k is calculated by adding the modulus q once or twice to
k to ensure that ¯k is of a ﬁxed length. That is, ¯k = k + γq
such that 2n ≤ ¯k < 2n + q where n = (cid:100)lg(q)(cid:101) and γ ∈ {1, 2}.
The side-channel leaks information on bits of the expo-
nent ¯k rather than directly on the nonce. To create HNP
instances from the leak we need to handle the unknown value
of γ. In previous works, due to ECC parameters the modu-
lus is close to a power of two hence the value of γ is virtually
constant [9]. For DSA, the modulus is not close to a power
of two and the value of γ varies between signatures. The
challenge is, therefore, to construct an HNP instance with-
out the knowledge of γ. We now show how to address this
challenge.

Recall that s = k−1(h(m) + αr) mod q. Equivalently,
k = s−1(h(m) + αr) mod q. The side-channel information
recovers the (cid:96) LSBs of ¯k. We, therefore, have ¯k = b2(cid:96) + a
where a = ¯k mod 2(cid:96) is known, and

2n−(cid:96) ≤ b < 2n−(cid:96) +

q/2(cid:96)(cid:109)
(cid:108)

.

(1)

Following previous works we use (cid:98)·(cid:99)q to denote the reduc-
tion modulo q to the range [0, q) and | · |q for the reduction
modulo q to the range (−q/2, q/2). Within these expres-
sions division operations are carried over the reals whereas
all other operations are carried over GF (q).

We now look at (cid:4)b − 2n−(cid:96)(cid:5)

.

and by (1) we have |v| ≤ (cid:6)q/2(cid:96)+1(cid:7).
Out of the HNP instances we generate, we select at ran-
dom 49 for the SSH attack, 130 for the TLS attack and
construct a lattice as described in Section 2.5.2. We solve
the CVP problem with a Sage script, performing lattice re-
duction using BKZ [34], and enumerate the lattice points
using Babai’s Nearest Plane (NP) algorithm [7]. We ap-
ply two diﬀerent techniques to extend NP to a larger search
space. First, we take multiple rounding values to explore
210 diﬀerent solutions in the tree paths [23, Sec. 4]. Second,
we use a randomization technique [26, Sec. 3.5] and shuﬄe
the rows of B between lattice reductions. We repeat with
a diﬀerent random selection of instances until we ﬁnd the
private key.

6.3 Results

We implemented the attack and evaluated it against the
two protocols, SSH with 1024/160-bit DSA and TLS with
2048/256-bit DSA. Table 2 contains the results. For both
protocols we only utilize traces with (cid:96) ≥ 3. With this value
we experimentally found that we require 49 such signatures
for SSH and 130 for TLS in order to achieve a reasonable
probability of solving the resulting CVP.

Because the nonces are chosen uniformly at random, only
about one in every four signatures has an (cid:96) that we can
utilize. To gather enough signatures and to compensate for
possible trace errors, we collect 580 SM sequences from TLS
handshakes and 260 from SSH.

On average, these collected sequences yield 70.8 (SSH)
and 158.1 (TLS) traces with (cid:96) ≥ 3. Comparing the traces to
the ground truth, we know that on average less than 3 have
trace errors. However, because an adversary cannot check
against the ground truth, we leave these erroneous traces
in the set and use them in the attack. We note that due
to the smaller key size in SSH, trace errors are much more
prevalent there.

We construct a lattice from a random selection of the col-
lected traces and attempt to solve the resulting CVP. Due
to the presence of the error traces there is a non-negligible
probability that our selected set contains an error. Further-
more, even if all the chosen traces are correct, the algorithm
may fail to ﬁnd the target solution due to the heuristic na-
ture of lattice techniques. In case of failure, we repeat the
process with a new random selection from the same set. We
need to execute a median value of 13 iterations for SSH and
22 for TLS until we ﬁnd the target solution.

As seen from Table 2, repeating our experiment over a
thousand trials on a cluster with hundreds of nodes, mixed
between Intel X5660 and AMD Opteron 2435 cores, we ﬁnd
the private key in all cases requiring a median 5.9 CPU min-
utes for the SSH key and 38.8 CPU minutes for the TLS key.
Although we executed each trial on a single core, in reality
the iterations are independent of each other—the lattice at-
tack is embarrassingly parallel.

7. CONCLUSION

In this work we disclose a programming error in Open-
SSL that results in a security weakness. We show that as
a result of the defect, the DSA implementation in Open-
SSL is vulnerable to cache-timing attacks, and exploit the
vulnerability to mount end-to-end attacks against SSH (via
OpenSSH) and TLS (via stunnel).

It is all too easy to dismiss the bug as an innocent pro-

gramming error. However, we believe that the core issue is
a design problem. When designing the “constant-time” ﬁx,
the developers elected to use an insecure default behavior.
From an engineering perspective the decision is justiﬁed—
it is much easier to identify the handful of locations where
we know that the exponent should be kept secret than to
analyze the entire library identifying exponents that can be
leaked. However, from a security perspective, this design
decision breaches the principle of fail-safe defaults, which
Saltzer and Schroeder [33] justify by saying: a design or
implementation mistake in a mechanism that explicitly ex-
cludes access tends to fail by allowing access, a failure which
may go unnoticed in normal use.

It is hard not to appreciate the extraordinary prescience of
Saltzer and Schroeder’s justiﬁcation. Had OpenSSL elected
to use a better design, that defaults to the constant-time be-
havior, a similar bug could have resulted in a small perfor-
mance loss for non-sensitive exponentiations, but the omis-
sion to preserve the ﬂag in question would have been unlikely
to jeopardize the security of the system. A more secure de-
sign would also improve the security of third-party products
in the case that developers may not be aware of the intrica-
cies of the constant-time ﬂags.

The simplest software-based solution to mitigate our at-
tack is to ﬁx the software defect. During responsible disclo-
sure, OpenSSL, LibreSSL, and BoringSSL merged patches
for CVE-2016-217813, assigned as a result of this work.

Broader, the clflush instruction does not require elevated
privileges to execute, hence we suggest access control mech-
anisms. We recommend that cache ﬂush instructions be
privileged-only execution, or at least restricted to memory
pages to which the process has write access and to memory
pages explicitly allowed by the kernel. Partially or fully dis-
abling caching during sensitive code execution can prevent
cache-timing attacks at the cost of performance [3]. Pre-
venting page sharing between processes is a partial solution
at the cost of increased memory requirements and avoiding
sharing of sensitive code is possible by changing the program
loader.

We close with some practical advice regarding this vul-
nerability. OpenSSH supports building without OpenSSL
as a dependency. We recommend that OpenSSH package
maintainers switch to this option. For OpenSSH adminis-
trators and users, we recommend migrating to ssh-ed25519
key types, the implementation of which has many desirable
side-channel properties. Furthermore, ensure that ssh-dss
is absent from the HostKeyAlgorithms conﬁguration ﬁeld,
and any such HostKey entries removed. On the TLS side,
we recommend disabling cipher suites that have DSA func-
tionality as a pre-requisite.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 310 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [July 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2282980.1).

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use  [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html) .

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible** . Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2017 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2261562.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2261562.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 32 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

# [R6] SecurityCenter 5.4.1 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter has recently been discovered to have several vulnerabilities. Two were reported by external parties while the rest were discovered during internal testing. Note that the library vulnerabilities were not fully diagnosed so SecurityCenter may or may not be impacted. Tenable opted to upgrade the libraries as it was more efficient. Details of the issues (with internal IDs for your tracking pleasure):

* 5 stored XSS that require authentication (31263, 31309, 31283, 31310, 31311) discovered internally by Chris Broome
* 1 stored XSS that requires authentication (12277) discovered internally by Kyle Teahan
* 1 stored XSS that requires authentication (31374) discovered internally
* 2 stored XSS that require authentication (31518, 31410) discovered and reported to Tenable by Kaustubh Padwad
* jQuery UI was upgraded to 1.12.0 potentially fixing 1 vulnerability
* PHP was upgraded to 5.6.28 fixing 4 vulnerabilities, 14 vulnerabilities from 5.6.27, 13 vulnerabilities from 5.6.26, and 19 from 5.6.25 (some of which are covered by IAVM 2016-B-0133)
* OpenSSL was upgraded to 1.0.2j fixing 1 vulnerability

Tenable would like to thank Kaustubh Padwad for privately reporting issues and giving us time to provide a fix for customers.

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that SecurityCenter be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has released SecurityCenter 5.4.1 to address these issues. The new version can be obtained from the Tenable Support Portal (<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=160>).

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the worst of
which allows attackers to conduct a time based side-channel attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.2j** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.2j** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers and the International Association for Cryptologic
Research’s (IACR) paper, “Make Sure DSA Signing Exponentiations
Really are Constant-Time” for further details.

### Impact

Remote attackers could cause a Denial of Service condition or have other
unspecified impacts. Additionally, a time based side-channel attack may
allow a local attacker to recover a private DSA key.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.2j"

```

This is due to a flaw in the validation of *. in the wildcard name string.  Originally reported by Alexander Minozhenko and James Bunton (Atlassian).  All versions of Node.js are affected.

#### Description

The ZIP signature-verification feature in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 does not ensure that the uncompressed\_filesize field is large enough, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PHAR archive, related to ext/phar/util.c and ext/phar/zip.c.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to the Java SE Kerberos client.
3. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.
