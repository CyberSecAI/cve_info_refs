Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-7983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow within the `bootp_print()` function in `print-bootp.c`. This function is responsible for printing the contents of BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The `bootp_print()` function, when processing a malformed or crafted BOOTP packet, attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running `tcpdump`. This can occur if the overflow overwrites critical memory regions with attacker-controlled data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could also lead to a crash of the `tcpdump` process, effectively causing a denial-of-service by terminating the monitoring functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Packet Injection:** An attacker sends a specially crafted BOOTP network packet to the network segment where `tcpdump` is running, either in live capture mode or while processing a crafted pcap file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the network where the vulnerable `tcpdump` instance is capturing traffic or be able to provide a malicious pcap file.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malformed BOOTP packet to trigger the buffer overflow within the `bootp_print()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions that this vulnerability is one of many fixed in a single update (tcpdump 4.9.0).
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory lists this CVE alongside many others, indicating a large batch of fixes.
*   The Debian Security Advisory also confirms that this CVE is one of many that are fixed in the 4.9.0-1 update.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:1871) explicitly mentions CVE-2016-7983 as one of the security fixes included.
*   The Debian bug report indicates the large number of vulnerabilities fixed by the update and requests that the update be fast-tracked to fix the numerous security issues.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
