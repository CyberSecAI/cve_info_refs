  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflow and integer overflow vulnerabilities in tcpdump's protocol decoding functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Integer overflow",
       "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create a crafted pcap file or send specially crafted packets to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode (without -w) which could cause it to display incorrect data, crash, enter an infinite loop or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted pcap file",
      "Specially crafted network packets"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump, or to provide a crafted pcap file.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in several protocol decoding functions within tcpdump. The affected protocols and functions include but are not limited to ah_print, arp_print, oam_print, sl_if_print, ethertype_print, ieee802_11_radio_print, ipcomp_print, juniper_parse_header, llc_print, mpls_print, pimv2_check_checksum, ppp_hdlc_if_print, rtcp_print, rtp_print, udp_print, vat_print, zmtp1_print_frame, and multiple functions within print-gre.c, print-stp.c, print-atalk.c, print-ip.c, print-tcp.c, print-bootp.c, print-tftp.c, print-calm-fast.c, print-geonet.c, cip_if_print, and functions related to DNS, DVMRP, HSRP, IGMP, lightweight resolver protocol, PIM. Additionally, there are also bugs in util-print.c:relts_print() which could cause a buffer overflow and in multiple protocol parsers (Geneve, GRE, NSH, OTV, VXLAN and VXLAN GPE) could cause a buffer overflow in print-ether.c:ether_print() ."
