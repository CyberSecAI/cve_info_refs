## Description

[![@kazuho](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41567?v=4&size=48)](/kazuho)[kazuho](https://github.com/kazuho)opened [on Dec 20, 2016](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/1144#issue-196594690)

A use-after-free vulnerability exists in H2O upto and including version 2.0.4 / 2.1.0-beta3 that can be used to by an remote attacker to mount DoS attacks and / or information theft[1].

Users using H2O version 2.0.x for serving plaintext HTTP (i.e. non-HTTPS) requests are advised to upgrade immediately to [version 2.0.5](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/releases/v2.0.5). Users of 2.1-beta series are advised to upgrade to [2.1.0-beta4](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/releases/v2.1.0-beta4) regardless of their configuration.

1: possible leakage includes the TLS private keys for deployments that have explicitly turned off [neverbleed](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/base_directives.html#neverbleed). Default is *on* meaning that the private keys are protected within a separate process.
