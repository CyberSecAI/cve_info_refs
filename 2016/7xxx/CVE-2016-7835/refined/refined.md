Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error.
- It stems from a flaw in the process of upgrading from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 in H2O.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free (CWE-416):  Memory is accessed after it has been freed, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS): An attacker can crash the server, disrupting its availability.
- Information Leakage: An attacker may gain access to arbitrary information, potentially including the server's private TLS keys if the `neverbleed` option is disabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network attack.
- Exploitation occurs during the upgrade from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.
- The attacker must be able to initiate an HTTP/1 connection that will trigger an upgrade to HTTP/2.

**Additional Details:**

- Versions affected: H2O versions 2.0.4 and earlier and 2.1.0-beta3
- The issue was reported by Kazuho Oku.
- The maintainers recommend upgrading to at least version 2.0.5 (for 2.0.x users) or 2.1.0-beta4 (for 2.1-beta users) to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The `neverbleed` feature, when enabled (which is the default setting), protects the private keys by isolating them in a separate process which would mitigate private key leakage.
