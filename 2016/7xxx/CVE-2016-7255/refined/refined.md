**2. Vulnerability Information**

Here's the extracted information related to CVE-2016-7255:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation issue in the Windows kernel driver `win32k.sys`. It stems from the improper handling of objects in memory. Specifically, it can be triggered via the `NtSetWindowLongPtr()` system call for the `GWLP_ID` index on a window handle with `GWL_STYLE` set to `WS_CHILD`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability for a local, unprivileged attacker to elevate their privileges to kernel level.
    *   **Improper Memory Handling:** The driver does not correctly handle objects in memory, leading to the exploitable vulnerability.
    *   **Win32k.sys System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific system call to a core driver.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the system.
    *   **System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
    *   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability can be used to escape security sandboxes.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the targeted system.
    *   **Malicious Application:** Exploitation is achieved by running a specially crafted application.
    *   **`NtSetWindowLongPtr` Call:** Specifically triggering the system call `NtSetWindowLongPtr()` on a window handle with `GWL_STYLE` set to `WS_CHILD` and `GWLP_ID` set to the offset of the pId in the window class.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the system.
    *   **Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute a specially crafted application on the target machine.
    *   **Understanding of Win32k API:**  Exploitation requires knowledge of specific parameters related to win32k windowing API.

**3. Additional Details From the Content (beyond the CVE description):**

*   **Exploitation Details:** The exploit involves manipulating page tables in memory, specifically the Page Map Level 4 Entry (PML4E), to create spurious PTEs (Page Table Entries) that control mapping to the address space.
*   **Specific System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted `SetWindowLongPtr` API call.
*   **Windows 10 Mitigations:**  Microsoft implemented new exploit mitigations in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update version of the `win32k` kernel component.
*   **Active Exploitation:** Google reported that this vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
*   **Targeted systems:** The exploit targets Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10 before the anniversary update, and Windows 2012 R2 64-bit systems.
*   **Exploit Techniques:** The exploit involves techniques such as:
    *   **PML4 Self-Reference Manipulation**: Exploiting the PML4 self-reference to access page tables.
    *   **Spurious PTE Creation**: Crafting page table entries to map controlled memory to arbitrary address spaces.
    *   **HAL Dispatch Table Overwriting:**  Overwriting the HalDispatchTable to redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled shellcode.
*   **Shellcode:** Shellcode is used to escalate privileges by locating the SYSTEM process and modifying the current process token.
*   **Operating system Specific offsets**: Different offset calculations are required for Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and 2012 R2 operating systems.
*   **Mitigation:**  The Chrome browser's sandbox prevents exploitation using Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10.

**4. Exploit Code Analysis:**

The exploit code (`main.c` from `exploit-db.com_6e893c64_20250125_205113.html`) demonstrates the following steps:

1.  **Setup:** Includes necessary headers and libraries and declares structures to represent module information.
2.  **`or_address_value_4` function:** Creates a window, sets `GWLP_ID` to exploit vulnerability, and sets focus on child window to trigger the exploit.
3.  **`create_spurious_pte_to_virtual_address`**: Uses a technique involving memory manipulation to set up page tables.
4.  **`store_shellcode_in_hal`**: Stores the shellcode in HAL to be executed after exploitation.
5.  **`get_OverwriteAddress_pointer` and `overwrite_TargetAddress`**: Locates and overwrites the target kernel address.
6.  **`main` Function**: Gathers system information, locates target address for exploit, patches shellcode with required values and then triggers the exploit on `NtQueryIntervalProfile` or `HalpApicRequestInterrupt`.

**5. Differences Between Exploits:**
*   The exploit from `github.com_9c33ea6b_20250126_115243.html` was designed as a more robust, real world, privilege escalation exploit for the vulnerability and has a better recovery than the other exploits provided.
*   The exploit from `www.exploit-db.com_bfa503e1_20250125_205110.html` is a simple crash PoC.
*   The exploit code from `github.com_28a3fcf9_20250125_205105.html` also aims to achieve privilege escalation.

**In Summary:**

The provided content confirms the existence of a local privilege escalation vulnerability in `win32k.sys`, identified as CVE-2016-7255. Attackers can leverage this flaw to gain control of systems by exploiting specific API calls and memory management vulnerabilities in Windows operating systems, before the Anniversary Update of Windows 10. The content provides both exploit details and proof-of-concept code for the vulnerability.
