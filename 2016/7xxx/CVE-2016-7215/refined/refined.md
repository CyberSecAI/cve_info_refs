Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-7215

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) handles objects in memory, specifically bitmap objects. By performing a certain sequence of calls to win32k.sys, an attacker can cause the kernel to make use of a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability in win32k.sys

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- The attacker can escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- An attacker needs to log on to the affected system.
- The attacker must run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and was not known to be exploited in the wild at the time of the advisory release.
-  A patch was released by Microsoft to address this vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
