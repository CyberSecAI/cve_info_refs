Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7435:

**Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `SCTC_REFRESH_CHECK_ENV` and `SCTC_REFRESH_EXPORT_TAB_COMP` and `SCTC_TMS_MAINTAIN_ALOG` function modules within SAP NetWeaver. These function modules do not properly sanitize input variables when executing `CALL 'SYSTEM'` statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78):** The core issue is the lack of proper input sanitization before passing variables to the operating system command execution. This allows for injection of malicious OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the affected SAP system, leading to complete control of the system. This includes access to sensitive data, system modification, and potentially disrupting business operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker doesn't need direct physical access to the server.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through network access to the vulnerable SAP NetWeaver system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials (be an authenticated user) to access and exploit the vulnerable function modules.
*   **Specific Privileges:** The attacker must possess specific privileges within the SAP system to call the vulnerable function modules.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Component:** SAP NetWeaver 7.40 SP 12, specifically within the `SCTC` subpackage of `SAP_BASIS`.
*   **Solution:** SAP Security Note 2260344 addresses the vulnerability and should be implemented to mitigate the risk.
*   **CVSS v3 Score:**
    *   Vendor Provided: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H)
    *   Onapsis Calculated: 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Timeline:** The vulnerability was reported to SAP on November 26, 2015 and a fix was released on March 8, 2016, with Onapsis releasing their advisory on September 22, 2016.

The provided content also mentions that this OS Command Injection vulnerability was identified in multiple function modules (`SCTC_REFRESH_CHECK_ENV`, `SCTC_REFRESH_EXPORT_TAB_COMP`, and `SCTC_TMS_MAINTAIN_ALOG`) and was fixed by the same SAP Security Note.
