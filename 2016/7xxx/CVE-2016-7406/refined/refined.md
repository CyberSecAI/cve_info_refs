Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Format string injection vulnerability in the message printout functionality of Dropbear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when usernames containing special characters (specifically "%" symbols) are created on a system and then used to connect to a Dropbear server.
- The vulnerability is also triggered in the dbclient where an attacker can control username or host arguments leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-side:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with root privileges when connecting to a Dropbear server.
- **Client-side:** A `dbclient` user who can control username or host arguments could potentially run arbitrary code with the privileges of the `dbclient` process. This is problematic if scripts or web pages pass untrusted input to the `dbclient` program.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Server-side:** Remote connection to a Dropbear server using a crafted username.
- **Client-side:** Manipulating the `dbclient` username or host arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Server-side:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to a vulnerable Dropbear server. They also need the ability to create usernames containing special characters on the target system if this is not already present.
- **Client-side:** The attacker needs to control the arguments provided to the dbclient program, for example through a web page or script.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the message printout functionality of dropbear where user provided strings containing format specifiers are used without proper sanitization leading to a format string vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects both the server (dropbear) and client (dbclient) components of the software.
- The vulnerability was fixed in dropbear version 2016.74.
