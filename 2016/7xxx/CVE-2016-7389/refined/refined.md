- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `mmap()` handler within the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (`nvidia.ko`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to the potential for out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privileges by gaining access to arbitrary physical memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the `mmap()` handler in the kernel mode layer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user with the ability to interact with the driver.
