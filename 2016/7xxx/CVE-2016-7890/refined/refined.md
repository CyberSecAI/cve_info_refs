Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a security bypass in the implementation of the same-origin policy within Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The core issue is a flaw in how Flash Player enforces the same-origin policy. This policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a script from one origin (domain, protocol, port) can interact with resources from a different origin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the same-origin policy restrictions.
*   This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions on behalf of the victim user
*   The advisory from SUSE indicates that exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   Red Hat's advisory mentions the possibility of causing flash-plugin to crash, execute arbitrary code, or disclose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily network-based. An attacker would need to host or inject malicious Flash content on a website.
*   A user would need to visit a website with the malicious flash content, or open a document with embedded malicious flash content to trigger the vulnerability.
*   This is consistent with the descriptions found in the Microsoft bulletin and SUSE information, which outline the typical web-based attack scenario.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject the malicious Flash content on a server accessible to the victim.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate on the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, meaning the victim needs to load or interact with the malicious Flash content (e.g. by visiting a webpage or opening a document with embedded content).

**Additional Notes**

*   The content from Microsoft indicates that the severity of this vulnerability is considered "Critical" on their supported platforms. However SUSE rated the vulnerability as "critical" while it is classified as having a "Moderate" severity rating by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player versions 23.0.0.207 and earlier, as well as 11.2.202.644 and earlier.
*   The provided content mentions multiple CVEs being addressed in a single security update (APSB16-39), meaning this CVE is one of several being patched at the same time.

**Summary of CVE-2016-7890**

The CVE describes a security bypass vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player's implementation of the same-origin policy. Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to potentially bypass security restrictions, gain unauthorized access, or execute arbitrary code through malicious flash content hosted online, or opened locally in a document. This requires that a user visit a malicious site, or open a document with embedded flash content.
