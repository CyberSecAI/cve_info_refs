{
  "CVE-2016-7908": {
    "Description": "The mcf_fec_do_tx function in hw/net/mcf_fec.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) does not properly limit the buffer descriptor count when transmitting packets, which allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and QEMU process crash) via vectors involving a buffer descriptor with a length of 0 and crafted values in bd.flags.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper limitation of buffer descriptor count during packet transmission in the mcf_fec_do_tx function of QEMU's ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop vulnerability in QEMU's ColdFire Fast Ethernet Controller emulation. Incorrect handling of buffer descriptors with zero length and crafted flags leads to uncontrolled looping.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) on the host system running QEMU. Repeated exploitation may lead to memory exhaustion and/or QEMU process crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local guest OS administrator can exploit the vulnerability within a virtualized environment by manipulating the network traffic to trigger the infinite loop.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires local guest OS administrative privileges to manipulate network configuration and trigger the vulnerable code path."
