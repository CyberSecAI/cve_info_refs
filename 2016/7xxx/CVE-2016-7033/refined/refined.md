CVE-2016-7033:
- Root cause of vulnerability: JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to stored XSS via dashbuilder due to lack of proper sanitization of editable fields.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: Remote, authenticated attackers with access to dashbuilder can store malicious scripts in editable fields. These scripts can then be executed when other users, including admins, view the affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.
- Attack vectors: Attackers inject malicious scripts into editable fields within the dashbuilder interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attackers need to be authenticated users with privileges to access and modify content within the dashbuilder component, typically this is the admin role.
