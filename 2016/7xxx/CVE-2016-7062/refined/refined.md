Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how authentication details were passed between `rhscon-ceph` and `rhscon-core`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Passwords were being leaked in clear text via command-line parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated local attacker could recover the cleartext password.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Local access to the system is required.
- Attackers could use the `ps -ef` command to view the command line parameters and expose the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the system.

The provided content gives more details compared to a typical CVE description, specifying the method of information leakage (command-line parameters visible via `ps -ef`) and the affected components (`rhscon-ceph` and `rhscon-core`).
