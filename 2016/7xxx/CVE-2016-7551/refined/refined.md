Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly manage RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) resources within the `chan_sip` module of Asterisk when handling certain SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) call scenarios. Specifically, when overlap dialing is enabled, or when a specific sequence of SIP requests is sent, the module incorrectly allocates new RTP resources without releasing previously allocated ones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Leak:** The core issue is a resource leak of RTP instances, which subsequently leads to a leak of UDP sockets associated with those instances.
*   **Improper Resource Management:** The `chan_sip` module fails to destroy existing RTP resources before allocating new ones, leading to the accumulation of leaked resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By repeatedly triggering the resource leak, an attacker can exhaust the available file descriptors for the Asterisk process, making it impossible to establish new RTP sessions, and ultimately rendering the system unable to handle calls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SIP Overlap Dialing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the "overlap dialing" feature of `chan_sip` is used, where the server informs the device that more digits are needed. This was the initial discovery.
*   **Specific SIP Request Sequence:** The issue can also be triggered by sending a specific series of SIP requests outside the normal call flow: sending an in-dialog INVITE after receiving a 404 response (but before sending an ACK). This vector does *not* require `allowoverlap=yes`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SIP requests to the vulnerable Asterisk server.
*   **SIP Authentication (Initial Vector):** Initially, the attacker was required to send SIP requests with authentication for the overlap dialing scenario to trigger the issue. However, the second vector does not require authentication, only a malformed request sequence.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and the specific scenarios or sequences to trigger it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in various versions of Asterisk, including versions 11.x, 13.x and Certified Asterisk.
*   Patches are available for Asterisk 11.23.1 and 13.11.1 (and Certified equivalents) that address the issue by properly releasing the old resources before new ones are allocated.
*   The bug can be triggered with or without the `allowoverlap=yes` configuration option.
