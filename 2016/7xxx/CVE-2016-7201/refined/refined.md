Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7201:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `JavascriptArray::FillFromPrototypes` method within the Chakra JavaScript engine used by Microsoft Edge.
*   This method is used by several JavaScript functions to set native array elements based on the prototype of an object.
*   The function calls `JavascriptArray::ForEachOwnMissingArrayIndexOfObject` using the prototype of the object as a parameter.
*   If the object's prototype is an array, it's assumed to be a `Var` array.
*   However, if the prototype is a `Proxy` object, the `Proxy` can return a parent prototype that is a native integer array, which causes a type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is a type confusion vulnerability. The Chakra engine incorrectly assumes that the prototype is a `Var` array when it's actually an integer array. This can lead to an integer being treated as an absolute pointer.
*   **Incorrect Prototype Handling:** The `FillFromPrototypes` method does not handle Proxy objects correctly, allowing for the manipulation of the prototype chain.
*   **Memory Corruption:** By treating an integer as a pointer, the vulnerability leads to memory corruption, which can allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content/ads.
*   **ActiveX Controls:** Attackers can embed a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted website or inject malicious code into a site visited by the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need to have any special privileges on the target system. The exploit runs in the context of the user browsing the malicious site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.
*   The exploit was tested on the stable version of Microsoft Edge.
*   Proof-of-Concept exploits are available, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be used to execute arbitrary code (e.g., launching notepad.exe) or cause a crash (INT 3).
*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying how the Chakra Javascript engine handles objects in memory.

The provided content gives a good technical explanation and demonstrates how the `Proxy` object is used to manipulate the prototype chain and trigger the type confusion. It also shows how to reproduce the issue and provides the context in which this vulnerability was exploited.
