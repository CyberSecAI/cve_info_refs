  "CVE-2016-7387": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x600000D. A value passed from a user to the driver is used without validation as an index to an internal array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Unchecked array index"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user-provided value is sent to the driver through the DxgkDdiEscape interface"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send ioctls to the driver, which typically requires local access."
  }
