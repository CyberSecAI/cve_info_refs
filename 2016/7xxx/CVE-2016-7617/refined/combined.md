There are two ways for IOServices to define their IOUserClient classes: they can
override IOService::newUserClient and allocate the correct type themselves
or they can set the IOUserClientClass key in their registry entry.

The default implementation of IOService::newUserClient does this:

  IOReturn IOService::newUserClient( task_t owningTask, void * securityID,
                                    UInt32 type,  OSDictionary * properties,
                                    IOUserClient ** handler )
  {
      const OSSymbol *userClientClass = 0;
      IOUserClient *client;
      OSObject *temp;

      if (kIOReturnSuccess == newUserClient( owningTask, securityID, type, handler ))
          return kIOReturnSuccess;

      // First try my own properties for a user client class name
      temp = getProperty(gIOUserClientClassKey);
      if (temp) {
          if (OSDynamicCast(OSSymbol, temp))
              userClientClass = (const OSSymbol *) temp;
          else if (OSDynamicCast(OSString, temp)) {
              userClientClass = OSSymbol::withString((OSString *) temp);
              if (userClientClass)
                  setProperty(kIOUserClientClassKey,
                              (OSObject *) userClientClass);
          }
      }

      // Didn't find one so lets just bomb out now without further ado.
      if (!userClientClass)
          return kIOReturnUnsupported;

      // This reference is consumed by the IOServiceOpen call
      temp = OSMetaClass::allocClassWithName(userClientClass);
      if (!temp)
          return kIOReturnNoMemory;

      if (OSDynamicCast(IOUserClient, temp))
          client = (IOUserClient *) temp;
      else {
          temp->release();
          return kIOReturnUnsupported;
      }

      if ( !client->initWithTask(owningTask, securityID, type, properties) ) {

  ... continue on and call client->start(this) to connect the client to the service

This reads the "IOUserClientClass" entry in the services registry entry and uses the IOKit
reflection API to allocate it.

If an IOService doesn't want to have any IOUserClients then it has two options, either override
newUserClient to return kIOReturnUnsupported or make sure that there is no IOUserClientClass
entry in the service's registry entry.

AppleBroadcomBluetoothHostController takes the second approach but inherits from IOBluetoothHostController
which overrides ::setProperties to allow an unprivileged user to set *all* registry entry properties,
including IOUserClientClass.

This leads to a very exploitable type confusion issue as plenty of IOUserClient subclasses don't expect
to be connected to a different IOService provider. In this PoC I connect an IGAccelSharedUserClient to
a AppleBroadcomBluetoothHostController which leads immediately to an invalid virtual call. With more
investigation I'm sure you could build some very nice exploitation primitives with this bug.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
