Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `tcp_print()` function within the `print-tcp.c` file of the tcpdump utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when data exceeds the allocated buffer size. In this case, a malformed TCP packet can cause the `tcp_print()` function to write beyond the boundaries of its buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash or infinite loop in the tcpdump application, effectively disrupting its functionality.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: In a more severe scenario, a specially crafted packet could be used to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the tcpdump process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Packets: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TCP network packet.
- PCAP Files: A malicious PCAP (packet capture) file containing the crafted TCP packet can also trigger the vulnerability when opened with tcpdump.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted TCP packets to a network segment being monitored by a vulnerable instance of `tcpdump`. This can be a direct connection, or through manipulation of traffic in transit.
- File Access: If using a PCAP file, the attacker would need a way to make the victim open the crafted PCAP file using the vulnerable tcpdump version, which may involve social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content shows that this CVE is part of a large group of vulnerabilities fixed in tcpdump version 4.9.0, where the `tcp_print()` function's buffer overflow is specifically addressed.

This information indicates that CVE-2016-7975 represents a serious vulnerability in `tcpdump` that can be exploited by sending specially crafted network traffic.
