Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `valider_xml` file in SPIP, which allows sending HTTP/FTP requests using the `var_url` parameter. The lack of proper sanitization of the provided URL allows an attacker to initiate requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is SSRF. The `valider_xml` script, without sufficient input validation, uses the `var_url` parameter to initiate connections to external URLs using functions such as `is_dir` and `recuperer_page`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassing Access Controls:** Attackers can exploit this SSRF vulnerability to bypass firewalls and access URLs that would otherwise be inaccessible to them directly.
- **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can potentially scan internal networks by sending requests to internal services.
- **Information Disclosure:** The server might inadvertently disclose sensitive information by accessing and retrieving content from the specified URLs.
- **Abuse of Server Resources:** The server's resources can be abused by making numerous requests to external or internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote, where an attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `valider_xml` script specifying the target URL via the `var_url` parameter. For example, `http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=http://router-dev.srv/` or `http://spip-dev.srv/ecrire/?exec=valider_xml&var_url=ftp://ftp.debian.org/`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SPIP instance. No specific user privilege is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by the lack of proper validation in `valider_xml`.
- The `is_dir` function at line 79 can be abused with FTP and other PHP wrappers.
- The `recuperer_page` function at line 123 is used for HTTP connections.

**Affected Versions:**

- SPIP versions up to and including 3.1.2 are vulnerable.

**Fixes:**

- The vulnerability is addressed in SPIP version 3.1.3 and by the commits:
