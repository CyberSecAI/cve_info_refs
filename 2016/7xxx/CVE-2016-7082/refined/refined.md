Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper handling of Enhanced Metafile (EMF) files within the `tpview.dll` component. This is related to the Cortado ThinPrint functionality used for virtual printing in VMware Workstation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Memory corruption: The vulnerability results in a memory corruption issue when processing a specially crafted EMF file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the hypervisor OS, impacting the host system.
* Initially assessed as critical, the severity was later reduced to low due to the need for a custom registry value to be set on the host machine, making exploitation more difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted EMF file processed through the virtual printing functionality.
*   A malicious virtual machine (VM) running on Windows can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted EMF file to the host through the virtual printing mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control a Windows-based virtual machine (VM) running on a vulnerable version of VMware Workstation.
*   Virtual printing must be enabled in VMware Workstation on the host system, which is not enabled by default.
* For the vulnerability to be exploitable the attacker needs a custom registry value to be added on the host machine

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `tpview.dll` component, which is part of the Cortado ThinPrint functionality for virtual printing.
*   The advisory was updated to clarify that this specific issue was moved to its own section (3f) and the severity was adjusted.
*   The vulnerability affects VMware Workstation Pro and Player.
*   Versions 12.x of the products are affected and for which no patch is planned, but version 14.x of the products are affected and are patched in version 14.1.0.
