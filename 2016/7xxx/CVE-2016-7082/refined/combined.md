##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware Workstation heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation contains vulnerabilities that may allow a Windows-based Virtual Machine (VM) to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. Exploitation of these issues may lead to arbitrary code execution in VMware Workstation running on Windows.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article [2146810](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146810) documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank E0DB6391795D7F629B5077842E649393 working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue to us. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7081 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. VMware Workstation memory corruption vulnerabilities via Cortado Thinprint**

VMware Workstation contains vulnerabilities that may allow a Windows-based virtual machine (VM) to corrupt memory. This includes TrueType fonts embedded in EMFSPOOL (CVE-2016-7083), and JPEG2000 images (CVE-2016-7084) in tpview.dll. Exploitation of these issues may lead to arbitrary code execution in VMware   Workstation running on Windows.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article [2146810](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146810) documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of Google's Project Zero for reporting these   issues to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the   identifiers CVE-2016-7083, and CVE-2016-7084 to these issues.

**c. VMware Tools NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities**

The graphic acceleration functions used in VMware Tools for OSX handle memory incorrectly. Two resulting NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities may allow for local privilege escalation on Virtual Machines that run OSX.

The issues can be remediated by installing a fixed version of VMware Tools on affected OSX   VMs directly. Alternatively the fixed version of Tools can be installed through ESXi or Fusion after first updating to a version of ESXi or Fusion that ships with a fixed version of VMware Tools.

VMware would like to thank Dr. Fabien Duchene "FuzzDragon" and Jian Zhu for independently   reporting these issues to VMware.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the   identifiers CVE-2016-7079 and CVE-2016-7080 to these issues.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in   each release, if a solution is available.

* Fusion 8.5.0

**d. VMware Workstation installer DLL hijacking issue**

Workstation installer contains a DLL hijacking issue that exists due to some DLL files loaded by the application improperly. This issue may allow an attacker to load a DLL file of the attacker's choosing that could execute arbitrary code.

VMware would like to thank Stefan Kanthak, Anand Bhat, and Himanshu Mehta for independantly reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7085 to this issue.

**e. VMware Workstation installer insecure executable loading vulnerability**

Workstation installer contains an insecure executable loading vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute an exe file placed in the same directory as installer with the name "setup64.exe". Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

VMware would like to thank Adam Bridge for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7086 to this issue.

**f. Workstation EMF file handling memory corruption vulnerability via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation contains a vulnerability that may allow a Windows-based virtual machine (VM) to corrupt memory. This issue occurs due to improper handling of EMF files in tpview.dll. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code execution in the hypervisor OS. The severity of this issue has changed to Low from Critical as the    exploitation of the issue requires a custom registry value to be added on the host machine.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article 2146810 documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of Google's Project Zero and Yakun Zhang of McAfee for individually reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7082 to this issue.
