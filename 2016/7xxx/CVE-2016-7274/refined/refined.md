Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow error exists within the `LoadUvsTable()` function of `usp10.dll`. This integer overflow can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:**  The integer overflow in `LoadUvsTable()` can cause a buffer to be allocated with an insufficient size. Subsequent data writes can then overflow this buffer, potentially corrupting heap memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **System Control:**  An attacker gaining control can perform various malicious actions, including:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:**
    *   An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious website (e.g., via phishing or social engineering).
*   **File Sharing Attack:**
    *   An attacker provides a specially crafted document file designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker convinces a user to open the malicious document file (e.g., via email or file sharing).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted website or document file that triggers the vulnerability in `usp10.dll`.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious content (visit the website or open the document).
*   **No Special Privileges Needed:** The attacker doesn't require any elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability once the user has been tricked into interacting with the malicious content.

**Additional Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability resides in `usp10.dll`, which is related to Microsoft Uniscribe, a component used for handling text rendering.
* The exploit involves modifying a font file (specifically, `phagspa.ttf`) to trigger the integer overflow in `LoadUvsTable()`.
* The initial fix provided in MS16-147 was incomplete and the vulnerability remained until MS17-013 was released.

**Affected Systems:**
* Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Windows RT 8.1.

This information provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability than the official CVE description, particularly regarding the specific function and file involved, the nature of the overflow, and how to trigger it.
