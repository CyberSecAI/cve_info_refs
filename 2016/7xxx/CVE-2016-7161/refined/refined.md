{
  "CVE-2016-7161": {
    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the .receive callback of xlnx.xps-ethernetlite in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a large ethlite packet.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The .receive callback of xlnx.xps-ethernetlite doesn't check the length of data before calling memcpy.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers may leverage it to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the qemu process on the host. Also, may cause QEMU to crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers must be able to send a large ethlite packet to trigger the overflow."
  }
