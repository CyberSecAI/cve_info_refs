Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7539:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The provided content from multiple sources (Debian bug tracker, GitHub commit, Red Hat Bugzilla, Openwall) all relate to a memory leak/resource exhaustion issue in ImageMagick, specifically when memory allocation fails and temporary files aren't released. The CVE description for CVE-2016-7539 is "potential DOS by not releasing memory". This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The core issue lies in `AcquireVirtualMemory` function within ImageMagick's caching mechanism. When ImageMagick fails to allocate memory, it attempts to map files for file-backed storage. However, when a resource limit is hit, it doesn't properly release the previously allocated resources leading to a resource leak. Additionally, temporary files created during failed memory mapping are also not removed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Resource Leak:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly release allocated resources (`MagickResource`) when `AcquireMagickResource` returns `false` due to resource limits. This results in memory usage increasing over time, degrading performance, and potentially leading to denial-of-service.
*   **Unreleased Temporary Files:** Temporary files created for failed file-backed memory mappings are not being deleted.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the following:

*   **Performance Degradation:** The resource leak causes a severe drop in performance as the system starts relying heavily on file-backed storage due to the exhaustion of memory resources.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Continuous processing of images with large memory requirements would eventually exhaust system resources.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** The accumulation of unreleased temporary files can potentially lead to disk space exhaustion.

**5. Attack Vectors**
The attack vector involves processing specially crafted or large images using ImageMagick that trigger memory allocation failures.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
The attacker needs to be able to submit images to an ImageMagick instance.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of ImageMagick prior to the fix commit (`4e81ce8b07219c69a9aeccb0f7f7b927ca6db74c`).
- The fix includes changes to the `magick/cache.c` file: Specifically, changes were introduced to address the resource counting inconsistencies between anonymous mappings and file-backed memory mappings.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `AcquireMagickResource` function returns false, which indicates a resource allocation failure.

**Additional Notes:**
The bug report from Debian indicates a severity of "grave" highlighting the seriousness of the issue.

The github commit message indicates the fix addresses the issue reported in `http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=28946`

The fix is described in the Debian bug report #833101 as "Fixed by 4e81ce8b07219c69a9aeccb0f7f7b927ca6db74c" referring to the github commit.
