Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7421:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop in the VMware Paravirtual SCSI (pvscsi) emulator within QEMU. This occurs when processing I/O requests because the `pvscsi_ring_pop_req_descr` function could return a positive value indefinitely, causing the I/O processing loop to continue without termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is the potential for an infinite loop within the I/O request processing logic of the pvscsi emulator. The condition that should stop the loop was not correctly implemented.
-   **Lack of Loop Termination:** The `pvscsi_ring_pop_req_descr` function did not properly account for when there are no more requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a denial of service, causing the QEMU process to become unresponsive and essentially crash the virtual machine. This occurs because the infinite loop consumes system resources, preventing QEMU from performing any other tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Guest User Privilege:** A privileged user within a QEMU guest operating system is required to trigger this vulnerability. They are able to send SCSI I/O requests which can trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have a privileged account within the guest operating system running inside the virtualized environment managed by QEMU. They must be able to interact with the emulated SCSI device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented by adding a check to make sure that the loop will terminate even if `pvscsi_ring_pop_req_descr` always returned positive values by limiting the loop to the ring size.
- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.
