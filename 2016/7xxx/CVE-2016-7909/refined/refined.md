```
**Summary of CVE-2016-7909:**

**Root Cause:** The `pcnet_rdra_addr` function in QEMU's PC-Net II emulator does not properly handle a zero-length descriptor ring, leading to an infinite loop.

**Weakness:**
- Improper handling of edge-case input (zero-length descriptor ring) resulting in an infinite loop.

**Impact:**
- A local guest OS administrator can trigger an infinite loop in the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service (DoS) and a QEMU process crash on the host.

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the PC-Net II network emulator's descriptor ring length.

**Required Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user or process within the guest operating system to manipulate the network device's descriptor ring settings.
