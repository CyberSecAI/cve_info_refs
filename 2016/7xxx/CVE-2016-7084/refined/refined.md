Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from memory corruption due to improper handling of JPEG2000 images embedded within a custom record (0x8000) inside EMF files, specifically within the `TPView.DLL` library. The `CTPViewDoc::WriteEMF` function parses EMF records and a nested function parses JPEG2000 data, leading to various vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities were identified, including:
*   Heap buffer overflows
*   Heap out-of-bounds reads
*   Division by zero errors
*   NULL pointer dereferences
*   Stack overflows

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within the VMware Workstation environment running on Windows. This could potentially allow an attacker to escape the virtual machine and gain control of the host system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious virtual machine sends a crafted EMFSPOOL data stream over the COM1 serial port on the guest system, containing a malformed JPEG2000 image embedded in an EMF record.
*   The `vprintproxy.exe` process on the host, responsible for handling virtual printing, processes this data via the vulnerable `TPView.DLL`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code inside a virtual machine, typically as a guest user.
*   Virtual printing must be enabled on VMware Workstation, which is not enabled by default.
*  The attacker needs to send a specially crafted EMF spool file over the virtual serial port.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit-db entry lists multiple specific instructions/code locations where crashes were observed due to these vulnerabilities.
* A Python script is mentioned to facilitate testing of JPEG2000 samples by wrapping them in EMF/EMFSPOOL structures and sending them via COM1.
* It was empirically confirmed that heap corruptions could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  The identified vulnerabilities include a mix of heap corruptions, null pointer dereferences and stack overflows, arising during the parsing of the specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
