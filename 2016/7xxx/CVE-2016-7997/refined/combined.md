Debian Bug     : 814732 825800 847055

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service
attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.

This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the CVE-2016-3714
vulnerability.

The undocumented "TMP" magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the CVE-2016-3715 vulnerability. Since
the "TMP" feature was originally implemented, GraphicsMagick added a
temporary file management subsystem which assures that temporary files
are removed so this feature is not needed.

Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) with a '|' for fixing the CVE-2016-5118 vulnerability.

CVE-2015-8808

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an out of bound read in the parsing of GIF
    files which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2317

    Gustavo Grieco discovered a stack buffer overflow and two heap buffer
    overflows while processing SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-2318

    Gustavo Grieco discovered several segmentation faults while processing
    SVG images which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-5240

    Gustavo Grieco discovered an endless loop problem caused by negative
    stroke-dasharray arguments while parsing SVG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7800

    Marco Grassi discovered an unsigned underflow leading to heap overflow
    when parsing 8BIM chunk often attached to JPG files which may cause
    denial of service.

CVE-2016-7996

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that there is no check that the provided
    colormap is not larger than 256 entries in the WPG reader which may
    cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-7997

    Moshe Kaplan discovered that an assertion is thrown for some files in
    the WPG reader due to a logic error which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8682

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a stack buffer read overflow
    while reading the SCT header which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8683

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    PCX coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-8684

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in the
    SGI coder which may cause denial of service.

CVE-2016-9830

    Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo discovered a memory allocation failure in
    MagickRealloc() function which may cause denial of service.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.20-3+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems (with the
exception of CVE-2016-9830) have been fixed in version 1.3.25-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.25-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

Subject: GraphicsMagick CVE Request - WPG Reader Issues

Two security issues have been discovered in the WPG format reader in
GraphicsMagick 1.3.25 (and earlier):

1. In a build with QuantumDepth=8 (the default), there is no check
    that the provided colormap is not larger than 256 entries,
    resulting in potential heap overflow.  This problem does not occur
    with larger QuantumDepth values.

2. The assertion:

    ReferenceBlob: Assertion `blob != (BlobInfo *) NULL' failed.

    is thrown (causing a crash) for some files due to a logic error
    which leads to passing a NULL pointer where a NULL pointer is not
    allowed.

These issues were discovered using American Fuzzy Lop by fuzzing with
the corpus by Moshe Kaplan discovered on Github at
<https://github.com/moshekaplan/FuzzGraphicsMagick>.

A patch resolving the two above issues is attached.
