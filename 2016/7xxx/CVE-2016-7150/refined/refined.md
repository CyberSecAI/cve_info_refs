Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2016-7150:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when rendering the "Short site name" within the website header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the site settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The injected malicious code is stored in the database and executed every time the page is loaded, affecting other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser: This allows attackers to perform actions such as:
  - Stealing user cookies and session information
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user
  - Defacing the website

**Attack vectors:**
- By exploiting the vulnerable "Short site name" field in the site settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with the ability to edit site settings.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `skins_site/_site_body_header.inc.php` file.
- The fix implemented in commit `dd975fff7fce81bf12f9c59edb1a99475747c83c` involves encoding the `notification_short_name` setting using `format_to_output()` function with `htmlattr` option to prevent the execution of injected Javascript code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in b2evolution version 6.7.5 and potentially earlier versions.
- This vulnerability is related to another XSS vulnerability, CVE-2016-7149, which affects forum posts.
