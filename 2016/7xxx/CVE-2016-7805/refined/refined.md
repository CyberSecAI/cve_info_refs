- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The mobiGate App fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack allows an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communications, potentially intercepting or manipulating data.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack through a MitM position, such as a malicious wireless access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the app and the server, such as by setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
