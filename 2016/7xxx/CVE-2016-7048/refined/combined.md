| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1378043#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-21 11:39:46 UTC  ``` The interactive installer used in EnterpriseDB-supplied PostgreSQL packages failed to secure its connection to the download server. Hence, an attacker able to impersonate the download server within a PostgreSQL installation's network scope can execute arbitrary code, as root, during initial installation or when the user directs the installed StackBuilder to acquire additional software. PostgreSQL binaries delivered other ways, such as installations from Yum or Apt packages, are unaffected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1378043#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-21 11:40:03 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the PostgreSQL project   ``` |  |

# Security Information

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) takes security seriously. This
allows our users to place their trust in PostgreSQL for protecting their
mission-critical data.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group follows a model that shares
responsibility between PostgreSQL itself and its deployment environment,
including hardware, operating system, and the application layer
(programming language, frameworks and client libraries). The PostgreSQL
documentation provides info on the inherent security features of PostgreSQL
and how to securely configure and run PostgreSQL.

Security vulnerabilities can exist both in PostgreSQL and software within the
PostgreSQL ecosystem, including client libraries, extensions, installers,
and other utilities. This page walks through what is considered a security
vulnerability in PostgreSQL, how to report PostgreSQL security
vulnerabilities, and how fixes for security vulnerabilities are released.

Please note that the PostgreSQL Project does not offer bug bounties.

## CVE Numbering Authority

The PostgreSQL Project is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), working with Red Hat
as our CNA Root. This allows us to assign our own CVE numbers and publish CVE
records for PostgreSQL and closely related projects.

We will currently assign CVE numbers for the following projects upon request to
cna@postgresql.org:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL RPM packaging](https://yum.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL DEB packaging](https://apt.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL Windows/macOS installers (EDB)](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-installers)
* [pgJDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)
* [psqlODBC](https://odbc.postgresql.org/)
* [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

Additional projects may request inclusion on the list above by emailing
cna@postgresql.org.

**NOTE:** The security team will only assign CVEs to projects
when requested by members of the project. If you think you've found a security
issue in a project other than PostgreSQL or it's packages and installers,
please contact the security team for that project. See below for more details.

## What is a Security Vulnerability in PostgreSQL?

A security vulnerability in PostgreSQL is an issue that allows a user to gain
access to privileges or data that they do not have permission to use, or
allows a user to execute arbitrary code through a PostgreSQL process.

The PostgreSQL Security Team does not consider reports on actions a PostgreSQL
superuser takes to be a security vulnerability. However, a report on an
unprivileged user escalating to superuser generally qualifies as valid.

The PostgreSQL Security Team typically does not consider a denial-of-service
on a PostgreSQL server from an authenticated, valid SQL statement to be a
security vulnerability. A denial-of-service issue of this nature could still
be a [bug](/account/submitbug/), and we encourage you to report it
on the [Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

Please do not report the lack of DMARC on postgresql.org mailing lists. This
is by design.

## Reporting a PostgreSQL Security Vulnerability

For security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL or any of the installers linked
from the [PostgreSQL download page](/download/), please email
security@postgresql.org.

For reporting non-security bugs, please visit the
[Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

If you are unsure if an issue is a security vulnerability, please err on the
side of caution and email
security@postgresql.org.

## Reporting non-PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

Please see below for how you can report security vulnerabilities in
PostgreSQL-related projects:

* For security vulnerabilities in the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org),
  please email
  pgsql-jdbc-security@lists.postgresql.org.
* For security vulnerabilities in [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/),
  please email security@pgadmin.org.
* If you wish to report a security vulnerability for any other open source project in
  the PostgreSQL ecosystem (e.g. a driver, an extension, or an installer) and
  need a secure communication channel, please email
  security@postgresql.org.

## PostgreSQL Security Releases

The PostgreSQL Project releases security fixes as part of
[minor version updates](/support/versioning/). You are always
advised to use the latest minor version available, as it will contain other
non-security related fixes.

A new PostgreSQL major release, which contains new features, has every prior
security fix.

If you find a security vulnerability in PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL Security
Team will credit you in the release notes and register a CVE for the
vulnerability. **Please do not register a CVE independently of the
PostgreSQL Security Team**.

## PostgreSQL Security Notifications

To receive notifications about security releases or other security
related news, you can subscribe to
the [pgsql-announce](/list/) mailing list. If you set your
subscription to only include the tag *Security*, it will
exclude all other announcements that are sent to this list.

## Known PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group believes that accuracy, completeness
and availability of security information is essential for our users. We choose
to pool all information on this one page, allowing easy searching for security
vulnerabilities over a range of criteria. This includes:

* Which major versions a security vulnerability is present in
* Which minor version update releases a security vulnerability is fixed in
* Whether an exploit requires a valid login
* CVSS score

You can find more detailed information about a security vulnerability by
clicking on the links in the table below.
