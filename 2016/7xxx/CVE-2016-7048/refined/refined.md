Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the interactive installer used in EnterpriseDB-supplied PostgreSQL packages failing to secure its connection to the download server. This insecure connection is made over plain HTTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Download Channel:** The installer downloads software components via plain HTTP instead of using HTTPS, which lacks encryption and authentication.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The downloaded software is executed as root by the installer, creating a pathway for remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the target system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can result in complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker, positioned within the network scope of the PostgreSQL installation, can intercept and modify the installer's requests.
*   **Impersonation:** The attacker impersonates the legitimate download server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have a presence within the target network. This could be through local network access or other means, like compromising a network device.
*   **MitM Positioning:** Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the installer and the download server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the interactive installer provided by EnterpriseDB.
*   Installations from other sources (like Yum or Apt packages) are not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability exists during the initial installation and when the user uses StackBuilder to download more software.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this CVE confirms the vulnerability and provides a short description but categorizes it as "NOTABUG."
*   The PostgreSQL security documentation does not list this specific CVE, implying it was not related to core PostgreSQL code.

In summary, CVE-2016-7048 is a critical vulnerability in the EnterpriseDB installer for PostgreSQL due to the use of insecure HTTP downloads. This allows a MitM attacker to execute arbitrary code as root, leading to full system compromise.
