The provided document is a security advisory from Huawei regarding two command injection vulnerabilities in their Unified Maintenance Audit (UMA) system, and it mentions that CVE-2016-7110 is assigned to one of the vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of validation of special characters in specific fields of the UMA system, which allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain sensitive information from the device.
- An attacker can modify device data.
- Exploitation can lead to the unavailability of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker connected to the device inserts special characters into vulnerable fields to modify them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be connected to the device.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable fields in the UMA system.

**Additional details:**
- Two vulnerabilities are described and both have a CVSS base score of 10.0
- The vulnerabilities are identified by Huawei as HWPSIRT-2016-07047 and HWPSIRT-2016-07048, with CVE-2016-7109 assigned to one and CVE-2016-7110 assigned to the other.
- The vulnerable UMA versions are those earlier than V200R001C00SPC200. The fixed version is V200R001C00SPC200
- The vulnerabilities were reported to Huawei by the Third Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security.
