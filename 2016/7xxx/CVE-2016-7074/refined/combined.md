* [PowerDNS Security Advisory 2016-04: Insufficient validation of TSIG signatures](#powerdns-security-advisory-2016-04-insufficient-validation-of-tsig-signatures)

This document is about PowerDNS 4.0. For other versions, please see the [documentation index](/).
# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2016-04: Insufficient validation of TSIG signatures

* CVE: CVE-2016-7073 CVE-2016-7074
* Date: December 15th 2016
* Credit: Mongo
* Affects: PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including 3.4.10, 4.0.1, PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 and up to and including 4.0.3
* Not affected: PowerDNS Authoritative Server 3.4.11, 4.0.2, PowerDNS Recursor < 4.0.0, 4.0.4
* Severity: Medium
* Impact: Zone content alteration
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version

Two issues have been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of an AXFR because of insufficient validation of TSIG signatures.
The first issue is a missing check of the TSIG time and fudge values in `AXFRRetriever`, leading to a possible replay attack. This issue has been assigned CVE-2016-7073.
The second issue is a missing check that the TSIG record is the last one, leading to the possibility of parsing records that are not covered by the TSIG signature. This issue has been assigned CVE-2016-7074.

PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including 3.4.10 and 4.0.1 are affected. PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.0.3 are affected.

For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is [available](https://downloads.powerdns.com/patches/2016-04)

We would like to thank Mongo for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1627409#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-10 15:35:18 UTC  ```  An issue has been found in PowerDNS allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to alter the content of an AXFR because of insufficient validation of TSIG signatures. A missing check that the TSIG record is the last one, leading to the possibility of parsing records that are not covered by the TSIG signature.

Package        : pdns
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2120 CVE-2016-7068 CVE-2016-7072 CVE-2016-7073
                 CVE-2016-7074

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative
DNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2016-2120

    Mathieu Lafon discovered that pdns does not properly validate
    records in zones. An authorized user can take advantage of this flaw
    to crash server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone
    under their control and then sending a DNS query for that record.

CVE-2016-7068

    Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns parses all records
    present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even
    legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an
    abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in a partial
    denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.

CVE-2016-7072

    Mongo discovered that the webserver in pdns is susceptible to a
    denial-of-service vulnerability. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
    to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of f TCP
    connections to the web server.

CVE-2016-7073 / CVE-2016-7074

    Mongo discovered that pdns does not sufficiently validate TSIG
    signatures, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to
    alter the content of an AXFR.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.
