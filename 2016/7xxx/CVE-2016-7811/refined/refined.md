{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CG-WLR300NX wireless LAN router fails to properly restrict access permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient access control leading to the ability of an attacker to perform arbitrary operations while an administrator is logged in.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with adjacent network access can perform arbitrary operations on the router while an administrator is logged in.",
  "Attack vectors": "Adjacent network access is required. The attacker needs to be able to reach the device on the same local network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router. User interaction is required and an administrator needs to be logged in to the router."
