## Description

[![@cowtowncoder](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?u=fdce6737a39cbda5176c8aa3bda56c2bf95190f0&v=4&size=48)](/cowtowncoder)[cowtowncoder](https://github.com/cowtowncoder)opened [on Sep 22, 2016](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/211#issue-178523226)

Although XML specification defines DTD handling as part of core xml processing, for most XML use cases for networking systems DTDs are either not used, or are minority use case. Conversely use of DTDs is often actually an anti-pattern considering access restrictions and overhead.

With this in mind, it would probably make sense to change defaults to disable DTD processing and just allow changing settings to enable it for cases where it is needed, as opposed to the other way around.

Compared to other default changes it would probably make sense to actually add a specific feature; but if not possible, then just simple setter for `XmlMapper`. Regardless it'd be easier to do this than to expect user to pre-configure `XMLInputFactory`.

An attacker could use this flaw to launch a SSRF attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-23 03:47:27 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adith Sudhakar   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c3)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-28 23:31:42 UTC  ```  Created jberet tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1380205](show_bug.cgi?id=1380205 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2016-7051 jberet: jackson-dataformat-xml: XmlMapper is vulnerable to SSRF attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c4)  Jason Shepherd    2016-09-28 23:31:47 UTC  ```  Created jackson-dataformat-xml tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1380206](show_bug.cgi?id=1380206 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-7051 jackson-dataformat-xml: XmlMapper is vulnerable to SSRF attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c5)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2016-12-20 17:10:51 UTC  ``` Hi  Is this a duplicate of CVE-2016-3720?

Resetting NEEDINFO to amaris, he assigned [CVE-2016-7051](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7051) in response to jsheppard, I've looked at the bugs but it's a bit convoluted. I've also emailed them to ensure they see this.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c7)  Jason Shepherd    2017-01-03 00:57:23 UTC  ``` These 2 issues are distinct. The first issues was about XXE, and was fixed with the change in line 115 here:  <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlFactory.java>  The second issue was about DTD, and was fixed with the change in line 117.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1378673#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2017-01-05 20:50:02 UTC  ``` Thanks for the clarification.   ``` |  |
