Based on the provided texts, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7051:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `XmlMapper` in `jackson-dataformat-xml` is vulnerable due to the default enabling of DTD processing in `XMLInputFactory`.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The vulnerability allows for XXE (XML External Entity) Out of Band attacks, which can be leveraged to launch SSRF attacks.
*   **DTD Processing:** The core issue stems from the XML specification defining DTD handling as part of core XML processing, which is enabled by default.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker can exploit this flaw to cause the server to make requests to internal or external resources.

**Attack Vector:**

*   By crafting malicious XML input with external entity references, an attacker can force the `XmlMapper` to resolve these references, potentially leading to SSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious XML to be processed by the vulnerable `XmlMapper`.

**Mitigation:**

*   The issue was resolved by disabling DTD processing by default and providing a way to explicitly enable it when needed. The code change involved modifying the `XmlFactory.java` file to disable `SUPPORT_DTD` for `XMLInputFactory` unless explicitly overridden.
