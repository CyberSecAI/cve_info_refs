{
  "CVE-2016-7428": {
    "Root cause": "ntpd's broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality can be abused due to a flaw in how it tracks the last received time of broadcast packets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer",
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send crafted broadcast mode NTP packets that cause ntpd to reject legitimate broadcast mode packets, leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain sends crafted NTP broadcast packets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the NTP broadcast domain, and must be able to send packets to the ntpd server."
