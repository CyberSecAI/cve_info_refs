## NTP.org ntpd contains multiple denial of service vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#633847

Original Release Date: 2016-11-21 | Last Revised: 2017-11-20

---

### Overview

NTP.org ntpd versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94 contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.

### Description

| NTP.org's ntpd, versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94, contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-476**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**: NULL Pointer Dereference -** CVE-2016-9311According to NTP.org, "ntpd does not enable trap service by default. If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service. Affects Windows only."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-9310According to NTP.org, "An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified, a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps, disabling legitimate monitoring. A remote, unauthenticated, network attacker can trigger this vulnerability."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7427According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode replay prevention functionality can be abused. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7428According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality can be abused. To limit abuse, ntpd restricts the rate at which each broadcast association will process incoming packets. ntpd will reject broadcast mode packets that arrive before the poll interval specified in the preceding broadcast packet expires. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-9312According to NTP.org, "If a vulnerable instance of ntpd on Windows receives a crafted malicious packet that is "too big", ntpd will stop working."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7431According to NTP.org, "Zero Origin timestamp problems were fixed by Bug 2945 in ntp-4.2.8p6. However, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp checks."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7434According to NTP.org, "If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet."[**CWE-605**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/605.html)**: Multiple Binds to the Same Port -** CVE-2016-7429According to NTP.org, "When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a different interface than was used for the request, the peer structure is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on a host with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating system doesn't check source address in received packets (e.g. rp\_filter on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source can send a packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to select wrong interface for the source and prevent it from sending new requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed, which happens on routing changes or every 5 minutes by default. If the attack is repeated often enough (once per second), ntpd will not be able to synchronize with the source."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-7426According to NTP.org, "When ntpd is configured with rate limiting for all associations (restrict default limited in ntp.conf), the limits are applied also to responses received from its configured sources. An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources."[**CWE-682**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)**: Incorrect Calculation -** CVE-2016-7433According to NTP.org, "Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulae have been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly."For more information, please see NTP.org's [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#November_2016_ntp_4_2_8p9_NTP_Se).The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-9312. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to perform a denial of service on ntpd. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Implement BCP-38.**Use "restrict default noquery ..." in your ntp.conf file. Only allow mode 6 queries from trusted networks and hosts.**Apply an update**Upgrade to [4.2.8p9](nwtime.org/ntp428p9_release), or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.**Monitor ntpd**Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running. |

#### Description

The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in `ntpd`’s broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality can be abused. To limit abuse, `ntpd` restricts the rate at which each broadcast association will process incoming packets. `ntpd` will reject broadcast mode packets that arrive before the poll interval specified in the preceding broadcast packet expires. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while being logged by `ntpd`, will cause `ntpd` to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.

---

#### Mitigation

* Only use broadcast mode on trusted networks.
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p9 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
Trap is a mechanism to collect NTP daemon information from remote.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NTP suite:
CVE-2016-9311: Trap crash, Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-9310: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS
vector. Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7427: Broadcast Mode Replay Prevention DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7428: Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7431: Regression: 010-origin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass.
Reported by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.
CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference in \_IO\_str\_init\_static\_internal().
Reported by Magnus Stubman.
CVE-2016-7426: Client rate limiting and server responses. Reported by
Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.
CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem. Reported independently
by Brian Utterback of Oracle, and by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra
of Boston University.
III. Impact
A remote attacker who can send a specially crafted packet to cause a
NULL pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a Denial of
Service. [CVE-2016-9311]
An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the
control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing
BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified,
a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing
information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,
disabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote. [CVE-2016-9310]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically
inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast
domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject
broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.
[CVE-2016-7427]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially
crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while
being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets
from legitimate NTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7428]
Origin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6. However, subsequent
timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of
some Zero origin timestamp checks. [CVE-2016-7431]
If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server
that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of
that crafted malicious mrulist query packet. [CVE-2016-7434]
An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server
response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can
periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate
limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses
from its sources. [CVE-2016-7426]
Ntp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included
twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to
a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix
for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did
not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulas have
been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.
[CVE-2016-7433]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with these attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.0.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.x]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3113#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2016-09-13 03:47:50 UTC   [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3113#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2016-09-13 04:52:27 UTC  ``` TALOS-CAN-0130 CVE-YYYY-NNNN  Network Time Protocol Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement Denial of Service Vulnerability   :: Summary  An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality of ntpd.  To limit abuse, ntpd restricts the rate at which each broadcast association will process incoming packets.  ntpd will reject broadcast mode packets that arrive before the poll interval specified in the preceding broadcast packet expires.  A vulnerability exists which allows remote unauthenticated attackers to send specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets which will cause ntpd to reject all broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.   :: Tested Versions  NTP 4.2.8p6   :: Product URLs  <http://www.ntp.org/>   :: CVSS Scores  CVSSv2: 5.0 - (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P) CVSSv3: 5.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L   :: Details  In response to the NTP Deja Vu vulnerability (CVE-2015-7973), ntp-4.2.8p6 introduced several new integrity checks on incoming broadcast mode packets.  Upon receipt of a broadcast mode packet, before authentication is enforced, ntpd will reject the packet if any of the following conditions hold:  1. The packet poll value is out of bounds for the broadcast    association, i.e.          pkt->ppoll < peer->minpoll || pkt->ppoll > peer->maxpoll  2. The packet was received before a full poll interval has elapsed    since the last broadcast packet was received from the packet's    sender.  i.e. A server cannot ingress packets more frequently than    `peer->minpoll`.  3. The packet transmit timestamp is less than the last seen    broadcast packet transmit timestamp from the packet's sender.    i.e. Broadcast packet transmit timestamps must be monotonically    increasing.  The following logic is used to ensure constraint 2, which ensures that broadcast associations will process only one incoming packet per poll interval:      /* ntp-4.2.8p6 ntpd/ntp_proto.c */     1305  if (MODE_BROADCAST == hismode) {     ...     1341      if (  (current_time - peer->timelastrec)     1342          < (1 << pkt->ppoll)) {     1343          msyslog(LOG_INFO, "receive: broadcast packet from %s arrived after %ld, not %d seconds!",     1344              stoa(&rbufp->recv_srcadr),     1345              (current_time - peer->timelastrec),     1346              (1 << pkt->ppoll)     1347              );     1348          ++bail;     1349      }     ...     1361     1362      peer->bxmt = p_xmt;     1363     1364      if (bail) {     1365          peer->timelastrec = current_time;     1366          sys_declined++;     1367          return;     1368      }     1369  }  If the time elapsed since the last broadcast packet was received from this peer is less than the poll interval declared by the sender (`(current_time - peer->timelastrec) < (1 << pkt->ppoll)`), the packet will be discarded.  (A previous check ensures that `pkt->ppoll` is within acceptable bounds.)  Unfortunately, line 1341 compares the current time against the last time any broadcast mode packet was received with a source IP address of the peer (`peer->timelastrec`).  In contrast to `peer->timereceived`, which is updated only when a *clean* (correctly authenticated and passing integrity checks) packet is received, `peer->timelastrec` is updated by all incoming broadcast packets including spoofed and replayed packets.  This leads to a trivial denial of service attack.  The attacker:  1. Discovers the IP address of the victim's broadcast server.    e.g. Send the victim a client mode NTP packet and discover the    broadcast server from the refid field of the victim's reply.  2. At least once per poll period, send the victim a spoofed    broadcast mode packet from the broadcast server.  This will set    `peer->timelastrec = current_time` such that, when a legitimate    packet is received, it will appear to have been received too    early (`(current_time - peer->timelastrec) < (1 << pkt->ppoll)`)    and will be discarded.      - The attacker does not need to be on the same subnet as the       victim.  The attacker can address the spoofed broadcast NTP       packet directly to the victim's IP address.      - The attacker can choose any reasonably small estimate for the       poll period.  Because the `peer->timelastrec` update happens       even when a packet fails the poll period check, there is no       penalty for sending packets too frequently.  To prevent this vulnerability, ntpd should only discard packets broadcast packets when less than one poll interval has elapsed since the last legitimate packet has been received (`peer->timereceived`).   :: Mitigation  There is no workaround for this issue.  Because the vulnerable logic is executed before authentication is enforced, authentication and the `restrict notrust` ntpd.conf directive have no effect.  An attacker can bypass `notrust` restrictions by sending incorrectly authenticated packets.  In order to succeed in an attack, the attacker must send at least one spoofed packet per poll period.  Therefore observing more than one NTP broadcast packet from the same sender address per poll period indicates a possible attack.  The following patch can be used to fix this vulnerability:      From 8522882496d3df2bd764de6d8f7afac4a8d84006 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001     From: Matthew Van Gundy <mvangund@cisco.com>     Date: Fri, 5 Feb 2016 17:38:32 -0500     Subject: [PATCH] Fix unauthenticated broadcast mode denial of service (peer->timelastrec)      Drop packets if they arrive less than one poll interval since the last     **clean** packet received on an association.  If we compare against the     last time that *any* packet was received, even one that will be dropped     for failing integrity checks, an attacker can DoS the association by     sending incorrectly authenticated packets or replaying old packets to     keep bumping the peer->timelastrec timer forward.     ---      include/ntp.h    |  4 +++-      ntpd/ntp_proto.c | 13 +++++++++++--      2 files changed, 14 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)      diff --git a/include/ntp.h b/include/ntp.h     index 6a4e9aa..cbf6cec 100644     --- a/include/ntp.h     +++ b/include/ntp.h     @@ -383,7 +383,9 @@ struct peer {        * Statistic counters        */       u_long  timereset;  /* time stat counters were reset */     - u_long  timelastrec;  /* last packet received time */     + u_long  timelastrec;  /* last packet received time (may     +                                 * include spoofed, replayed, or other     +                                 * invalid packets) */       u_long  timereceived; /* last (clean) packet received time */       u_long  timereachable;  /* last reachable/unreachable time */      diff --git a/ntpd/ntp_proto.c b/ntpd/ntp_proto.c     index ad45409..1ea5cee 100644     --- a/ntpd/ntp_proto.c     +++ b/ntpd/ntp_proto.c     @@ -1338,11 +1338,20 @@ receive(             ++bail;           }      -     if (  (current_time - peer->timelastrec)     +     /*     +      * Ensure that at least one poll interval has     +      * elapsed since the last **clean** packet was     +      * received.

The original decision to check against timelastrec instead of timereceived was both conscious and deliberate.  That doesn't necessarily mean that decision was correct.  Unfortunately, I'm not finding my notes on exactly what those reasons were.  So I'm going with your patch as the case you have described is certainly more "present".  If somebody remembers a good reason why timelastrec should be used instead, we can re-evaluate.  STAGED for 4.2.8p9. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3113#c6)  Harlan Stenn    2016-11-21 14:55:42 UTC  ``` Matt,  Thanks for the report.
