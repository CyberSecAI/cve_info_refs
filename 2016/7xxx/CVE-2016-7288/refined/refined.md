Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `TypedArray.sort` function within the Microsoft Edge scripting engine. Specifically, the issue occurs during the comparison of elements within the TypedArray during a sort operation. The comparison function's return value is converted to a number, and this conversion can trigger the `valueOf` function, which, if crafted maliciously, can detach the underlying ArrayBuffer of the TypedArray, leading to use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF), which means that memory is accessed after it has been freed.
*   **Inadequate Detachment Check:** While there's a check to see if the TypedArray has been detached, this check is performed *before* the return value from the comparison function is processed. The conversion process could detach the TypedArray after the check but before the buffer is used by sort operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running Microsoft Edge.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website crafted to trigger the vulnerability. If a user views the page using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge, the attack will be triggered.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into legitimate websites, including those that accept user-provided content or advertisements, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a website** or **ability to inject malicious content into existing websites**.
*   **Must convince the user to visit the malicious page** or **a legitimate page with malicious content** using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Edge.

**Technical Details (from Exploit-DB):**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `TypedArrayCompareElementsHelper` function within the ChakraCore engine (Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine).
*   The `sort` function of a TypedArray calls a comparison function provided by the user.
*   The return value of the comparison function is converted to a number which can trigger a malicious `valueOf` function which detaches the typed array.
*   After detachment, the sort operation may perform an out of bounds write to freed buffer
*   A provided Proof of Concept (PoC) illustrates the vulnerability by detaching the `ArrayBuffer` using postMessage within the `valueOf` function.

**Additional Information from MS Security Bulletin:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in the MS16-145 security update.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows clients and **Moderate** for Windows servers.
