      "root_cause": "A bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0.",
      "weaknesses": "Improper handling of NULL values passed to structure callbacks within ASN.1 CHOICE structures. Specifically, if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings, a NULL value can be passed to the structure callback.",

      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide the application with crafted, invalid CMS structures that trigger the vulnerable code path. The attacker doesn't need any special access or permissions to send the malicious structure."
