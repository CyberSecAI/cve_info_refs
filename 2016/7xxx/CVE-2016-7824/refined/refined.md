Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7824:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to enable debug options on the WNC01WH network camera.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of an exposed debug option that an attacker can enable through the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
    *  An authenticated attacker with administrative privileges on the device can enable the debug option.
    *  This enables an attacker to gain high levels of access, potentially leading to complete system compromise, including modification of device settings and data, or to impact device stability or availability.

**Attack vectors:**
    *  The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be on the same local network as the target device.
    *  The attack is performed through the web interface of the affected product.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *  The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative credentials to the device's web interface.
    * The attacker needs to have network access to the device.

**Additional notes:**
* The CVSS v3 base score is 6.8 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
* The CVSS v2 base score is 2.7 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N).
