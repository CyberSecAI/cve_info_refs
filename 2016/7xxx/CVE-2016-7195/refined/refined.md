Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown for CVE-2016-7195:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft browsers (Internet Explorer and Edge) handle objects in memory. Specifically, it's a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory corruption:** The browsers are vulnerable to memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory.
*   This vulnerability can allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** An attacker can then install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted website:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability through the browser.
*   **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that accept/host user-provided content or ads.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically via email, instant message, or by tricking them into opening a malicious attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website.
*   The attacker must convince the user to visit the website using a vulnerable browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browsers.
*   The severity rating is "Critical" for Windows client operating systems and "Moderate" for Windows server operating systems.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The fix involves modifying how the browsers handle objects in memory.
