- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL pointer dereference occurs when processing an ACK message from an unrecognized SIP endpoint. This is because the code does not perform a lookup of an "artificial" endpoint for ACK messages, unlike other SIP request types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a missing null check after failing to look up the artificial endpoint for processing ACK messages, which leads to a crash when the code attempts to determine if ACLs should be applied, dereferencing the NULL pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the Asterisk server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a SIP ACK message from an endpoint that is not recognized by the Asterisk server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the Asterisk server. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated remote sessions.
