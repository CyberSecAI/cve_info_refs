{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is located in `coders/meta.c` within the `parse8BIM` function. The code iterates through a token, writing bytes to an output buffer. A heap-buffer-overflow occurs because the loop condition `while (len--)` doesn't prevent writing past the end of the allocated token buffer, due to a missing check `len > 0`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a heap-buffer-overflow which can lead to denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted image file that contains malicious meta data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted image to be processed by ImageMagick."
