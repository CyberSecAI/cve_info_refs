Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `var_url` parameter within the `valider_xml.php` file in SPIP. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where unsanitized user input (`var_url`) is directly included in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `var_url` parameter.
*   The attacker then tricks a user (typically an administrator/webmaster, given the context of the valider\_xml function) into clicking on this malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
*   The attacker must rely on social engineering or another method to make a victim visit the malicious URL.
*   No special privileges on the target system are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `valider_xml.php`, specifically line 146 where the unsanitized `$url` variable is printed within an `<h1>` tag.
*   The provided proof of concept URL demonstrates how to inject HTML code to display "XSS!"
*   The vulnerable versions are SPIP <= 3.1.2.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in SPIP 3.1.3 and the following commits:
    *   <https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23200>
    *   <https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23201>
    *   <https://core.spip.net/projects/spip/repository/revisions/23202>
*   The issue was initially discovered on 15/09/2016 and a fix was released on 30/09/2016
