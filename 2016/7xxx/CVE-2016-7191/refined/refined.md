Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect validation of ID tokens within the `Passport-Azure-AD` library for Node.js. Specifically, the issuer wasn't being validated, even when the `validateIssuer` was set to true in the configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Token Validation:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the issuer of the ID token, allowing for the possibility of accepting tokens from unauthorized sources.
- **Bypass of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass Azure Active Directory authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to bypass authentication to a targeted host web application.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the web application by sending specially crafted tokens containing valid user identity claims.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack involves sending a specially crafted token to a target web application.
- The token needs to contain valid user's identity claims, but not necessarily be signed by the correct issuer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft or obtain a token with valid user identity claims.
- The attacker must be able to send the crafted token to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker doesn't seem to need specific access to the internal network or infrastructure, only the ability to interact with the web application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects web applications using the `Passport-Azure-AD` for Node.js library for Azure AD authentication.
- Standard Azure AD authentication not using this library is not affected.
- The vulnerability exists in outdated versions of the `Passport-Azure-AD` for Node.js library.
- Patched versions are 1.4.6 and greater for 1.x branch, and 2.0.1 and greater for the 2.0 branch.
- The patch fixes the issuer validation, which might cause issues for applications using the common endpoint with `validateIssuer` set to true. The fix requires either setting validateIssuer to false if common endpoint needs to be used or using tenant specific endpoint.
