# Security update for the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library

Applies ToAzure Active Directory

## Summary

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Azure Active Directory Passport library (Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js) incorrectly validates ID tokens.

An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could bypass Azure Active Directory authentication to a targeted host web application. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted token to the target web application that contains a valid user's identity claims. This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how ID tokens are validated when Passport strategies take advantage of Azure Active Directory.

### Frequently asked questions about this vulnerability

Q1: I use Azure Active Directory. Am I affected?

A1: This vulnerability only affects web applications that use the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library to take advantage of Azure AD for authentication. Standard Azure AD authentication that does not use the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library is not affected. The vulnerability exists in web applications that use outdated versions of the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library.

Q2: What is Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js?

A2: Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js is a collection of Passport strategies that help you integrate your node applications with Azure Active Directory. It includes OpenID Connect, WS-Federation, and SAML-P authentication and authorization. These providers let you use the many features of Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js, including web single sign-on (WebSSO), Endpoint Protection with OAuth, and JWT token issuance and validation.

### Update information

Developers who use the Passport Azure AD Node.js library must download the latest version of the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library, and then update their applications. The technical details are published in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/azuread/passport-azure-ad).

Developers who use version 1.**x** must update to version 1.4.6.

Developers who use version 2.0 must update to version 2.0.1.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Passport-Azure-AD for Node.js library.

# Security vulnerability details for passport-azure-ad <1.4.6, 2.0.0

Our team discovered a vulnerability in the Passport-Azure-AD for NodeJS library affecting versions <1.4.6 and 2.0.0. This vulnerability can allow a user to bypass certain authentication mechanisms. Developers using the Passport-Azure-AD for NodeJS library need to download the latest version of the Passport-Azure-AD for NodeJS library.

> * **if you are currently on 1.x below 1.4.6, please update to 1.4.6 or
>   greater**
> * **if you are currently on 2.0.0, please update to 2.0.1 or
>   greater**

Updated packages are available on npm. To ensure you get additional bug fixes going forward, please ensure your package.json file is updated to take PATCH and MINOR level updates of our libraries.

#### Example for 2.0 release:

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "passport-azure-ad": "^2.0.1"
  }
}
```

#### Example for 1.4 release:

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "passport-azure-ad": "^1.4.6"
  }
}
```

### Upgrade Notes

1. This patch updates the library that your application runs, but does not change the current state of your users, including any sessions they had open. This applies to malicious users who could have exploited this vulnerability to gain access to your system. If your application has users with existing sessions open, after applying the patch, ensure all these sessions are terminated and users are required to sign in again.
2. In previous versions of the Passport-Azure-AD for NodeJS library, the issuer wasn't validated, even if you had set validateIssuer to true in your configuration. This is fixed in versions 1.4.6 and 2.0.1. However, this may mean you get 401s if you are using the common endpoint in the identityMetadata config setting and have validateIssuer to true. If you are using the "common" endpoint (which looks like "<https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration>"), issuers cannot be validated. You can fix this in two ways:

* If you are a single-tenant app, you can replace 'common' with your tenantId in the endpoint address. The issuer will be validated. IdentityMetadata set to support a single tenant should look like "<https://login.microsoftonline.com/72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011dddd/.well-known/openid-configuration>" with your tenant GUID replaced in the path or "<https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>" with your tenant name replaced in the path.
* If you are a multi-tenant app and need to go against the common endpoint, you must set validateIssuer to false. Be aware that the issuer field of the token will not be validated and all issuers will be accepted.
