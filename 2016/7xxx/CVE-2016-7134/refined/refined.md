Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `curl_easy_escape` function within the libcurl library, specifically how the buffer allocation size is calculated. The PHP `curl_escape` function calls the `curl_easy_escape` function, passing it a user-controlled string length. If a large enough string length is provided to curl\_easy\_escape, the buffer calculation overflows, leading to a small buffer being allocated. Subsequently, when the code attempts to write data to this small buffer, a heap overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking on the string length before allocating memory, leading to an integer overflow when adding 1 to a large value.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The flawed size calculation leads to a heap overflow, as the write operation attempts to write outside the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not stated explicitly, the heap overflow, due to the controlled data, allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to memory, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow, as demonstrated in the bug report, leads to a segmentation fault, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the PHP `curl_escape` function, which directly interfaces with the vulnerable `curl_easy_escape` in libcurl. An attacker can supply a large input string to this PHP function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The exploit can be triggered remotely by sending a crafted request to a PHP application using the vulnerable `curl_escape` function.
*   **Ability to pass a large string:** The attacker must be able to provide a large string to the `curl_escape` function via user input or other means.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided bug report reveals that the vulnerability was initially discovered in PHP 7.0.9, but this issue was related to `curl_easy_escape` function in `libcurl`.
*   The fix involves explicitly checking for integer overflow before calling `curl_easy_escape` in the PHP binding.
*   The vulnerability was also present in the `curl_unescape` function. The fix also includes checks in `curl_unescape`.
*   The fix in PHP was introduced in commit `72dbb7f416160f490c4e9987040989a10ad431c7`.
*   The bug was also reported to libcurl, but the details of the libcurl fix are not contained in this report.
*   The bug report also mentions that the `str_len` variable can be less than 0 (or bigger than INT\_MAX), which also can cause the overflow.
