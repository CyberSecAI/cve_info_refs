Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-7411:

**1. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in a flaw during the deserialization of objects in PHP. Specifically, when an object deserialization fails, PHP cleans the object's properties using `zend_hash_clean`, but the object itself remains in the `objects_store`. Consequently, the destructor of this partially constructed object is invoked during shutdown with uninitialized properties which results in memory corruption.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue. This arises from the incomplete cleanup of a partially constructed object after a deserialization failure. The destructor of this broken object is called with uninitialized properties during shutdown leading to memory corruption.
*   **Improper Object Handling:** The deserialization process does not correctly handle partially constructed objects when deserialization fails, specifically the object remains in the object store with its destructor called later.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can cause memory corruption, leading to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or unexpected program behavior.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly state RCE, memory corruption vulnerabilities can, in some cases, be chained to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `unserialize()` function. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object string that will fail during deserialization, leading to memory corruption upon shutdown.
*   The attacker requires the ability to supply user-controlled serialized data. This is likely going to be through a web interface, but this is not limited to this.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is marked as "remote" meaning an attacker doesn't necessarily require local access.
*   **Data Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious serialized data into the application, specifically data that will fail during deserialization.
*   **No Specific Privileges:** There are no specific privilege requirements for exploitation.
*  **Affected Versions** : The vulnerability affects PHP versions prior to 5.6.28

**Technical details from the provided content:**

*   The bug report on bugs.php.net details the issue and a suggested fix to call zend\_object\_store\_ctor\_failed() after cleaning the object properties, and also adds a test case in bug73052.phpt.
*   The patch commit on GitHub shows the fix implemented in `Zend/zend_objects_API.c` and `ext/standard/var_unserializer.c` by calling `zend_object_store_ctor_failed` and addition of a test case.

This vulnerability is classified as "normal" severity and "remote" exploitable in the Gentoo Security Advisory.
