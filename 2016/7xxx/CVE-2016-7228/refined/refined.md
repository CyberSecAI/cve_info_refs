**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

- Email attack scenario: An attacker could send the specially crafted file via email and convince the user to open it.
- Web-based attack scenario: An attacker could host or leverage a compromised website containing a specially crafted file and convince the user to visit the website and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file. This can be done via email, or by hosting the file on a website and tricking the user into opening it.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges or access on the target system before exploitation.
