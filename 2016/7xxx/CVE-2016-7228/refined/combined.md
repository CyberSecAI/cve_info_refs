## Security Update for Microsoft Office (3199168)

Published: November 8, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

For more information, see the **Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Microsoft Office initializes variables.
* Affected versions of Office and Office components handle objects in memory.

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3199168](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3199168).

## Update FAQ

**I have Microsoft Word 2010 installed. Why am I not being offered the 3127951 update?**

The 3127951 update only applies to systems running specific configurations of Microsoft Office 2010. Some configurations will not be offered the update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically indicated as being affected in the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Furthermore, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335). For a list of Microsoft Office products that an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Office Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2016-7233

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Office or Word reads out of bound memory due to an uninitialized variable which could disclose the contents of memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could view out of bounds memory.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by properly initializing the affected variable.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [**CVE-2016-7233**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7233) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Multiple Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

Note that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector for these vulnerabilities. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Office handles objects in memory.

## Microsoft Office Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2016-7244

A denial of service vulnerability exists when a specially crafted file is opened in Microsoft Office. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause Office to stop responding.  Note that the denial of service would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights.

For an attack to be successful, this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.
