{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of data received from the X server by the libXrandr library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory writes due to mishandling of server responses."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious X server can cause out-of-bounds memory writes in the client application using the libXrandr library.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious X server sending crafted responses to the client application."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the X server and be able to send crafted responses to a client using the vulnerable libXrandr library.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the libXrandr library trusts the server to send correct protocol data and doesn't verify that the values will not overflow or cause other damage. A privileged client connecting to an unprivileged and malicious server could be exploited."
