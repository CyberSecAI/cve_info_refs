  "CVE-2016-7055": {
    "description": "Montgomery multiplication may produce incorrect results due to a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits.",
    "root_cause": "Carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect results in Montgomery multiplication"
    ],
    "impact": "Transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Attackers may be able to deduce information about a private key with significant resources. ECDH key negotiation can be attacked using Brainpool P-512 curves.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker with the ability to send specially crafted input. Requires multiple clients choosing the Brainpool P-512 curve and the server sharing the private key among them."
