Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The C software implementation of AES encryption and decryption in wolfSSL versions 3.9.8 and earlier uses a T-table based approach.
*   The table lookups within this implementation do not properly account for cache-bank access times.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cache-Timing Side Channel:** The vulnerability stems from a side-channel attack based on cache-timing. Specifically, the way the AES implementation accesses memory can reveal information about the data being processed due to timing differences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AES Key Discovery:** A local attacker can exploit the timing differences in cache accesses to discover AES keys being used by a victim process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to run a crafted application on the same machine (or virtual machine/hyper-thread) as the victim.
*   **Cache Observation:** The attacker's application needs to monitor or measure cache-bank hit timing differences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the same machine or have access to the CPU cache. This could include users on the same VM, hyperthread, or system.
*   **Ability to Run Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a program designed to trigger and observe the cache-timing behavior.
*   **Knowledge of Cache Timing:** The attacker must have sufficient understanding to leverage cache-bank access time variations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the C software implementation of AES in wolfSSL.
*   VM users, hyper-threading users, and systems where potential attackers have access to the CPU cache are at risk.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gorka Irazoqui Apecechea and Xiaofei Guo from Intel Corporation.
*   This issue was addressed in wolfSSL version 3.9.10.
*   The issue also affected MySQL and was addressed in version 5.5.53 and MariaDB 10.0.28
