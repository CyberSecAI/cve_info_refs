  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-7034",
    "description": "It has been reported that CSRF tokens are not properly handled in JBoss BPM suite dashbuilder. Old tokens generated during an active session can be used to bypass CSRF protection. In addition, the tokens are sent in query string so they can be exposed through the browser's history, referrers, web logs, and other sources. Attackers may be able to obtain old tokens from various sources in the network and perform CSRF attacks successfully.",
    "root_cause": "Insecure handling of CSRF tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF tokens are not properly handled",
      "Old tokens can be reused to bypass CSRF protection",
      "Tokens are sent in query strings, exposing them through browser history, referrers, and web logs"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers may be able to obtain old tokens and perform CSRF attacks successfully, potentially leading to unauthorized actions by a user.",
    "attack_vector": "Attackers obtain old CSRF tokens from various sources in the network (e.g., browser history, referrer headers, web logs) and use these tokens to perform CSRF attacks.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid CSRF token, which may be done by monitoring network traffic or access logs where the token is revealed."
