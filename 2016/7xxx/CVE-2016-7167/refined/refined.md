  "CVE-2016-7167": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflow flaws leading to heap-based buffer overflows were found in the way curl handled escaping and unescaping of data. An attacker could potentially use these flaws to crash an application using libcurl by sending a specially crafted input to the affected libcurl functions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The `curl_escape`, `curl_easy_escape`, `curl_unescape`, and `curl_easy_unescape` functions in libcurl did not properly check the provided string length arguments.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Integer overflows",
          "Heap-based buffer overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can crash an application using libcurl by providing a long string to affected functions, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending a specially crafted input string with an incorrect length argument to vulnerable functions"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Ability to control or influence the input passed to libcurl's escaping/unescaping functions.",
        "details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a large value (e.g., 0xffffffff) is provided as the string length argument in `curl_escape()`, `curl_easy_escape()`, `curl_unescape()` or `curl_easy_unescape()` functions, causing an allocation of zero bytes of heap memory, which libcurl then attempts to write gigabytes of data into."
      },
     {
        "root_cause": "libcurl using the NSS library as TLS/SSL backend incorrectly re-used client certificates for subsequent TLS connections when a certificate from file was used for one TLS connection but no certificate was set for a subsequent TLS connection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect reuse of client certificates",
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could potentially use this flaw to hijack the authentication of the connection by leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Leveraging a previously created connection with a different client certificate.",
        ],
         "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate connections and somehow ensure that the client certificate is re-used"
