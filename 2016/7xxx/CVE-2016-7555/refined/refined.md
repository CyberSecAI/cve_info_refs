Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7555:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `avi_read_header` function within the FFmpeg library. This leak occurs when decoding a crafted AVI file containing a specific malformed 'strh' struct.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The primary weakness is the failure to properly release allocated memory when processing a specially crafted AVI file, resulting in a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory Exhaustion: Repeated processing of such malformed AVI files could lead to a gradual exhaustion of system memory, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious AVI File: The attack vector involves providing a crafted AVI file containing a specific malformed 'strh' struct to the vulnerable FFmpeg library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted AVI file to a system using the vulnerable version of FFmpeg for processing.
- The attacker does not need local access to the system; they can trigger this remotely by having the vulnerable system process the malicious file (e.g., through a web service that handles video uploads)
