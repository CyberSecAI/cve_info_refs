{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DFS Client driver insecurely creates and deletes drive letter symbolic links in the current user context.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The driver calls `DfscCreateSymbolicLink` to create a drive letter symbolic link without specifying `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK`, disabling access checking. The drive letter is user-controlled with minimal verification. Similarly, `DfscDeleteSymbolicLink` calls `ZwOpenSymbolicLinkObject` without `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK`, allowing deletion of any drive letter symbolic link.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete arbitrary drive letter symbolic links and mount a DFS share in its place, potentially leading to the execution of system-level code and privilege escalation. By redirecting the C: drive link to a local location, an attacker could gain elevated privileges by triggering system code to execute from the manipulated location.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system and the ability to execute code. Access to a DFS share is required for the initial mapping of a drive letter."
