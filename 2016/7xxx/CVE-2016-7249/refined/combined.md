## Update FAQ

**There are GDR and/or CU (Cumulative Update) updates offered for my version of SQL Server. How do I know which update to use?**

First, determine your SQL Server version number. For more information on determining your SQL Server version number, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 321185](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/321185).

Second, in the table below, locate your version number or the version range that your version number falls within. The corresponding update is the one you need to install.

**Note** If your SQL Server version number is not represented in the table below, your SQL Server version is no longer supported. Please upgrade to the latest Service Pack or SQL Server product in order to apply this and future security updates.

| **Update number** | **Title** | **Apply if current product version isâ¦** | **This security update also includes servicing releases up throughâ¦** |

For additional installation instructions, see the Security Update Information subsection for your SQL Server edition in the **Update Information** section.

**What are the GDR and CU update designations and how do they differ?**

The General Distribution Release (GDR) and Cumulative Update (CU) designations correspond to the two different update servicing branches in place for SQL Server. The primary difference between the two is that CU branches cumulatively include *all* updates for a given baseline, while GDR branches include *only* cumulative critical updates for a given baseline. A baseline can be the initial RTM release or a Service Pack.

For any given baseline, either the GDR or CU branch updates are options if you are at the baseline or have only installed a previous GDR update for that baseline. The CU branch is the only option if you have installed a previous SQL Server CU for the baseline you are on.

**Will these security updates be offered to SQL Server clusters?**

Yes. The updates will also be offered to SQL Server 2012 SP2/SP3, SQL Server 2014 SP1/SP2, and SQL Server 2016 RTM instances that are clustered. Updates for SQL Server clusters will require user interaction.

If the SQL Server 2012 SP2/SP3, SQL Server 2014 SP1/SP2, and SQL Server 2016 RTM cluster has a passive node, to reduce downtime, Microsoft recommends that you scan and apply the update to the inactive node first, then scan and apply it to the active node. When all components have been updated on all nodes, the update will no longer be offered.

**Can the security updates be applied to SQL Server instances on Windows Azure (IaaS)?**

Yes. SQL Server instances on Windows Azure (IaaS) can be offered the security updates through Microsoft Update, or customers can download the security updates from Microsoft Download Center and apply them manually.

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple SQL RDBMS Engine Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft SQL Server when it improperly handles pointer casting. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities if their credentials allow access to an affected SQL server database. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges that could be used to view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SQL Server handles pointer casting
