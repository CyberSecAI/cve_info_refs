Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises because PowerDNS (both the Authoritative Server and Recursor) parses all records present in a DNS query, regardless of whether they are needed or legitimate. This behavior allows an attacker to craft a malicious query with a large number of records, which the server then processes unnecessarily.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inefficient Parsing:** The core issue is the server's inefficient parsing of all DNS records within a query, even if they are not relevant to the request.
-   **Lack of Validation:** There is an absence of proper validation or filtering of the records in the query, allowing the server to process potentially malicious and unnecessary data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Abnormal CPU Usage:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a significant increase in CPU load on the PowerDNS server by sending specially crafted DNS queries with many records.
-   **Partial Denial of Service (DoS):** If the server becomes overloaded due to excessive CPU usage, it can lead to a partial denial of service, impacting the server's ability to respond to legitimate DNS queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted DNS queries to the affected PowerDNS server. No authentication is required.
-   **Crafted DNS Queries:** Attackers can craft DNS queries containing an unusually large number of records to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected PowerDNS server to send the malicious DNS queries.
-   **Ability to Craft DNS Queries:** The attacker needs to be able to craft DNS queries with a large number of records.
-   **No Authentication:** No prior knowledge or authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and including 3.4.10 and 4.0.1, as well as PowerDNS Recursor versions up to and including 3.7.3 and 4.0.3.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge.
-   A workaround involves using dnsdist with `RecordsCountRule()` and `RecordsTypeCountRule()` to block crafted queries with many records.
-   Patches are available for older versions if upgrades are not immediately feasible.
-   Red Hat Bugzilla also tracks this issue as bug #1627365.
-   Debian security advisories DSA-3763-1 (pdns-recursor) and DSA-3764-1 (pdns) address this vulnerability
