Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7254:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from improper handling of pointer casting within Microsoft SQL Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Pointer Casting:** The core issue lies in the way SQL Server performs pointer casting operations. This can lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior that can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privileges:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges within the SQL Server instance.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially view, change, or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Account Creation:** The attacker might also be able to create new accounts with administrative or other elevated permissions.
*   The most severe vulnerabilities could allow an attacker could to gain elevated privileges that could be used to view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Server Access:**  The attacker needs to have credentials that allow access to an affected SQL server database. This implies that the attack is likely to originate from within the network or from an authenticated connection to the SQL server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the SQL Server database.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how SQL Server handles pointer casting.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important"
*   This vulnerability affects multiple versions of SQL Server including SQL Server 2012, SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2016
