- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CG-WLR300NX wireless LAN router does not properly validate requests, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CWE-352)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the router by visiting a malicious webpage, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes or other actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges, but requires user interaction (UI:R). The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or find a way to inject malicious content on a site visited by the user.
