- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vSphere Data Protection (VDP) appliance contains a private SSH key with a known password. This key is configured to allow key-based authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a private SSH key with a known password for key-based authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthorized remote attacker can log into the appliance with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access via SSH.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the password for the private SSH key and have network access to the VDP appliance.
