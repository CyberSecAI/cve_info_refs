Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-7300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) application for Mac not properly validating updates before executing them. This lack of proper validation allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Update Validation:** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of updates by the Microsoft AutoUpdate application on macOS. This allows for the possibility of malicious code being introduced under the guise of a legitimate update.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  If successfully exploited, this vulnerability enables an attacker who already has the ability to run code on the targeted system to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining control of the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could elevate their privileges on the system to gain administrative or root level control.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context. This would allow the attacker to install software, view/modify/delete data or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Executable Placement:** An attacker needs to place a specially crafted, malicious executable in a location that is used by the MAU for installing updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must already have the ability to execute code on the target macOS system. This could be achieved through other exploits, malware, or by compromising a user account on the system.
- **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to write to a directory/location where the MAU update application looks for its packages.
