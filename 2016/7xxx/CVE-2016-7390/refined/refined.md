  "cveId": "CVE-2016-7390",
  "description": "NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvlddmkm.sys) handler for DxgkDdiEscape ID 0x7000194 where a value passed from a user to the driver is used without validation as the index to an internal array, leading to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The DxgkDdiEscape handler for 0x7000194 doesn't do bounds checking with the user provided lengths it receives.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing bounds check on user-provided lengths passed to memcpy."
    ],
     "impact": "When these lengths are passed to memcpy, overreads and memory corruption can occur leading to denial of service or potential escalation of privileges. A proof of concept demonstrates an out-of-bounds read, and it should be possible to cause an out-of-bounds write leading to kernel memory corruption.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A user-mode application can make a DxgkDdiEscape call with a crafted input to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local system."
  }
}
