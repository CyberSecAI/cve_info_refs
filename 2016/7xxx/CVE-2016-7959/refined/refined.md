- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - Inadequate Encryption Strength: The pre-shared keys used for machine-to-machine communication within TIA Portal project files could be brute-forced by local attackers with read access.
    - Cryptographic Issues: The transport format of TIA Portal project files, used during project migration, is not sufficiently protected, allowing local attackers to potentially access sensitive configuration settings.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Inadequate encryption strength, leading to brute-forceable pre-shared keys.
    - Insufficient protection of transport format, allowing circumvention and potential access to sensitive information.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Local attackers with read access to TIA Portal project files can access sensitive information. Specifically, they might gain access to preshared keys used for machine-to-machine communication or sensitive configuration settings within project files.

- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Local access to TIA Portal project files is required.
    - Attackers need read access to the project files stored on workstations or network storage.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system
    - Read access to TIA Portal project files
