# WordPress 4.6.1 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.6.1 is now available. This is a **security release** for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

WordPress versions 4.6 and earlier are affected by two security issues: a cross-site scripting vulnerability via image filename, reported by SumOfPwn researcher [Cengiz Han Sahin](https://twitter.com/cengizhansahin); and a path traversal vulnerability in the upgrade package uploader, reported by [Dominik Schilling](https://dominikschilling.de/) from the WordPress security team.

Thank you to the¬†reporters for practicing [responsible disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/).

In addition to the security issues above, WordPress 4.6.1 fixes 15 bugs from 4.6.¬†For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.6.1)¬†or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=4.6.1).

[Download WordPress 4.6.1](https://wordpress.org/download/)¬†or venture over to Dashboard ‚Üí Updates and simply click ‚ÄúUpdate Now.‚Äù Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.6.1.
