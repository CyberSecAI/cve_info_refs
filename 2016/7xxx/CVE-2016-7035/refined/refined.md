  "CVE-2016-7035": {
    "description": "An authorization flaw was found in Pacemaker, where it did not properly guard its IPC interface. An attacker with an unprivileged account on a Pacemaker node could use this flaw to, for example, force the Local Resource Manager daemon to execute a script as root and thereby gain root access on the machine.",

      "root_cause": "Improper authorization checks in Pacemaker's IPC interface allowed unprivileged clients to interact with privileged daemons.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient privilege checks",
        "Improper IPC guarding"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation, potentially leading to cluster-wide remote command execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to a Pacemaker node",
         "Flawed authorization via IPC"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Unprivileged user account on a Pacemaker node is required."
