Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-7162

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from File Roller's incorrect handling of symbolic links during the deletion of temporary files after archive extraction. Specifically, when File Roller recursively deletes a directory, it doesn't check if the directory is a symbolic link and follows it, leading to deletion of the linked directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core issue is a path traversal vulnerability where a symlink within a specially crafted archive can point to an arbitrary location outside the intended temporary directory, leading to the deletion of files in that location
- **Improper symlink handling:** When deleting a folder recursively, file-roller doesn't check if the folder is a symlink and follows it, deleting the content of the linked directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can craft a malicious archive containing symlinks that, when opened/extracted by a victim using File Roller, will cause the application to delete files and directories outside of the extraction directory and intended temporary directory, potentially leading to data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Archive:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted archive file containing malicious symlinks that point to locations outside of the intended extraction directory.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open/extract the malicious archive using a vulnerable version of File Roller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious archives**: The attacker needs to be able to create archives with the malicious symlinks.
- **Social engineering**:  The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening/extracting the malicious archive.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in File Roller 3.5.4 and was fixed in version 3.20.3
- Both absolute and relative symlinks can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
- The fix involves modifying the code to avoid following symlinks when recursively deleting a folder, thus preventing deletion of unintended files.
