### Bug Description

(Excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker. I will try to be as clear as possible).

After attempting to create an archive from folders who where actually just links, it seems that file-roller deleted all their content.

Here are the steps I did :

- Inside a folder, I had a dozen subfolders. Half of them where just links to folders placed elsewhere.

- In Nautilus, I selected all these subfolders, choosed "compress", then choosed "zip" as the format.

- The archive was created without any error message.

I was expecting all the folders to be added to the archive, regardless of them being links or not.

The disastrous result :

- The archive is unusable. Attempting to expand it results in an error message (I didn't take note, but it was something generic saying the archive couldn't be expanded).

- But more importantly, the content of the folders who where linked has disappeared. That is, the links are still here, the folders which they link to are still here, but they have been emptied.

The files are not in the dustbin, they just disappeared.

I noticed this right after I created the archive, I didn't touch my computer in-between.

That's why I suspect file-roller.

I will try to reproduce this bug in order to confirm it.

But not before I find a way to recover my files, I lost a week of work because of this.

Ubuntu 12.10 x64

file-roller 3.6.1.1-0ubuntu1.1

I made further tests, and I could reproduce this bug on another computer (with the same setup).

It happens when you attempt to extract the archive containing linked folders.

Here are the exact steps to reproduce this bug :

1- Create a folder, say "container"

2- Inside, create another folder, say "real folder"

3- Place some files inside this folder (a week worth of precious work for instance. ah ah!)

4- Create a link of this folder in nautilus (right clic -> create a link)

It should look like this :

-container

        |\_real folder (with files inside)

        |\_link to real folder

5- Create an archive from "link to real folder" (a zip in my test)

6- Extract that archive anywhere you want.

    You will get an error message saying the files could not be extracted.

    Check "real folder" : all the files should have disappeared !

Another thing to note : I works from one computer to another.

Create a "bogus" archive in computer A, extract it in computer B.

If computer B happens to have the same folders as the links contained inside the archive, they will also be emptied.

(There goes my backup files by the way -and one chance to recover them. I'm so happy).

My disc drives are formatted in ext4 if it's of any help.

I opened a new bug at bugzilla : 698554 (<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=698554>)

It may be a duplicate of [bug 647753](/bugs/647753) (<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=647753>) but I'm not entirely sure, as the description is not clear and it wasn't updated since 2011.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c0)  tcharlss    2013-04-22 11:00:38 UTC  ``` This may be a duplicate of [bug 647753](show_bug.cgi?id=647753 "RESOLVED OBSOLETE - flie roller overrides data in other directory as expected") but I'm not entirely sure, its description isn't crystal-clear. I also reported this bug on launchpad : [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file-roller/+bug/1171236](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/file-roller/%2Bbug/1171236)   Package : file-roller 3.6.1.1-0ubuntu1.1 os : ubuntu 12.10 x64 partition format: ext4   Description : =============  When extracting a zip archive containing links to folders (instead of "real" folders), if the hard drive where the archive is extracted contains folders named like those contained in the archive (no matter their location), their content will be erased. The files erased are not in the dustbin, they just disappear.   Expected behavior : ===================  When creating an archive from links to folders, I would expect the "real" folders to be added to the archive. And upon extraction, I would expect them not to be emptied !   Steps to reproduce the bug : ============================  1- Create a folder, say "container" 2- Inside, create another folder, say "real folder" 3- Place some files inside this folder (say a week worth of precious work for instance. ah ah!) 4- Create a link of this folder in nautilus (right clic -> create a link)  It should look like this : -container         |_real folder (with files inside)         |_link to real folder  5- Create an archive from "link to real folder" (a zip in my test) 6- Extract that archive anywhere you want.     You will get an error message saying the files could not be extracted.     Check "real folder" : all the files should have disappeared !  Another thing to note : I works from one computer to another. Create a "bogus" archive in computer A, extract it in computer B. If computer B happens to have the same folders as the links contained inside the archive, they will also be emptied. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c1)  Andrea Antolini    2016-08-17 11:33:39 UTC  ``` ... just happened similar thing/bug  also with file-roller 3.20.2!!! and gnome 3.20.2 on Archlinux 64bit  Note for file-roller devs : let me know if it is better open a new bug report for file-roller 3.20.x regarding this issue...  btw, try to explain better what happened..  Today I opened a not recent backup.tar.gz with file-roller 3.20.3 which contain backupped folders . Into some folder are present  some symbolic links  Links was  \home\myaccount\Documents  >> \home\public\Documents \home\myaccount\Music >> \home\public\Music \home\myaccount\Pictures >> \home\public\Pictures \home\myaccount\Videos >> \home\public\Videos  Then I clicked to Documents symbolic link  file-roller opened a second session and showed me files in the real folder on hard drive (I guess...)  Then I close  all file-roller and noticed that suddenly wallpaper disappeared  (mhh really strange ...  ;-)  A quick check and  sadly discovered that real folder \home\public was empty : all files and folders gone!!!!  Fortunatelly  I have another recent backup but this bug is really dangerous.. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c2)  Paolo Bacchilega    2016-08-17 13:53:50 UTC  ``` The problem was caused by symbolic links pointing to absolute paths, this is now fixed in the current development version, the fix will be available in the next stable release (3.20.3) and higher versions.    Thank you for the bug reports. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c3)  Tyler Hicks    2016-09-07 22:50:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335039](attachment.cgi?id=335039 "Test archive for testing this bug in File Roller") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335039&action=edit "Test archive for testing this bug in File Roller") Test archive for testing this bug in File Roller  I initially had some trouble understanding the security impact of this bug due to the reproducer instructions mixing the setup (creating the archive) with instructions for triggering the flaw (extracting the archive). I'll attempt to improve on the instructions by attaching a previously created archive.  = Setup =  Create /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt which will act as an important file that we wouldn't want to lose.  $ mkdir -p /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/ $ echo data > /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt  = Test =  1. Open the attached links.tar with File Roller    $ file-roller links.tar  2. Double-click either of the "absolute" or "relative" files  3. Close the opened Nautilus window as well as the File Roller window  4. Check to see if /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt has been unintentionally deleted   If a user was tricked into opening a crafted archive containing a malicious symlink target, File Roller could remove unintended files when cleaning up the temporary cache directory.  This bug was introduced in File Roller 3.5.4 by the following commit:    commit [34b64f3a897c4b4e8e180c028f326bc921eb08ec](https://git.gnome.org/browse/file-roller/commit/?id=34b64f3a897c4b4e8e180c028f326bc921eb08ec)   Date:   Sun Aug 5 21:04:47 2012 +0200        use GFile instead of 'char *'  It was fixed in File Roller 3.20.3 by the following commit:    commit [f70be1f41688859ec8dbe266df35a1839ceb96c5](https://git.gnome.org/browse/file-roller/commit/?id=f70be1f41688859ec8dbe266df35a1839ceb96c5)   Date:   Wed Aug 17 15:41:35 2016 +0200        do not follow symlinks when deleting a folder recursively  I will request a CVE on the oss-security list and update this bug when one has been assigned. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c4)  Tyler Hicks    2016-09-07 22:55:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Paolo Bacchilega from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c2)) > The problem was caused by symbolic links pointing to absolute paths  Relative symlink targets also triggered the bug. Either of these files in the attached links.tar are sufficient:  $ tar tvf links.tar  lrwxrwxrwx tyhicks/tyhicks   0 2016-09-07 17:04 absolute -> /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/ lrwxrwxrwx tyhicks/tyhicks   0 2016-09-07 17:04 relative -> ../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../dev/shm/will-be-emptied/ ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=698554#c5)  Tyler Hicks    2016-09-08 14:14:59 UTC  ``` CVE-2016-7162  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/08/4> ``` |  |
