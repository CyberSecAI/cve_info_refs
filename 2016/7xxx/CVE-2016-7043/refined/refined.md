Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7043:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the storage of usernames and passwords in plaintext within Java properties files in KIE Server and Business Central.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Password Storage:**  Passwords and usernames are stored directly in readable format.
- **Insecure Configuration:** The default configuration lacks proper security measures for credential management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Any application deployed on the same server as KIE Server or Business Central can access these properties, granting access to the services protected by those credentials. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Lateral Movement:** An attacker could leverage compromised credentials to move laterally within the system and gain control over other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Application:** An attacker who can deploy a malicious application on the same server as KIE server or Business Central can access the plaintext credentials.
- **Access to server:**  An attacker who gains access to the server's file system may be able to obtain the properties files and view the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deploy applications:** The attacker must have the ability to deploy a malicious application on the same server as the vulnerable KIE Server or Business Central instance.
- **Access to the server:** The attacker must have some level of access to the server's file system.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a fix to load passwords from a keystore instead of plaintext properties. This fix is related to the commits mentioned in the GitHub pull request #1273 for the droolsjbpm-integration repository.
- The fix involves changes to how passwords are read within the `kie-server-controller` module.
- The bug report on Red Hat Bugzilla (1375760) tracks this issue.
