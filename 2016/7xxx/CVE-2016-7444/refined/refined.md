  "CVE-2016-7444": {
    "Description": "The gnutls_ocsp_resp_check_crt function in lib/x509/ocsp.c in GnuTLS before 3.4.15 and 3.5.x before 3.5.4 does not verify the serial length of an OCSP response, which might allow remote attackers to bypass an intended certificate validation mechanism via vectors involving trailing bytes left by gnutls_malloc.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OCSP certificate check did not verify the serial length of the OCSP response. The function used to compare the serial numbers incorrectly assumed they were the same length.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper verification of serial number length in OCSP responses.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially use an OCSP response for a different certificate (but from the same CA) to bypass the intended certificate validation mechanism and continue using a revoked certificate, if the serial from the revoked certificate is a prefix of the other one, and the additional bytes happen to be equal on the system doing the verification.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid OCSP response for a certificate whose serial is a prefix of the serial of the revoked certificate and relies on specific bytes being present due to `gnutls_malloc` behavior.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the OCSP response and needs knowledge of a certificate with a serial that is a prefix of the revoked certificate's serial. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of or be able to predict how `gnutls_malloc` will behave on the verification system to ensure the appended bytes will match."
