- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the graphic acceleration functions used in VMware Tools for OSX. The memory is handled incorrectly, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the graphics acceleration functions of VMware Tools for OSX.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may lead to local privilege escalation on Virtual Machines that run OSX.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker within an OSX virtual machine can trigger the vulnerability by exploiting the incorrect memory handling in the graphics acceleration functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be inside the OSX virtual machine and be able to trigger the vulnerable graphics acceleration functions.
