- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server delivers session cookies without the "secure" flag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing "secure" flag on session cookies transmitted over HTTPS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position could obtain web session cookies under certain circumstances. This could lead to unauthorized access or impersonation.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible. The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept traffic.
