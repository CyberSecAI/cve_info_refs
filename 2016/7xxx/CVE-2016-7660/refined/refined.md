Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `syslogd` daemon's handling of Mach messages, specifically `MACH_NOTIFY_DEAD_NAME` messages. The `syslogd` daemon (running as root) hosts the `com.apple.system.logger` Mach service, which is reachable from sandboxed contexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Handling of `mach_port_name_t`:** The `syslogd` daemon uses a `mach_port_name_t` value (which is just an integer) from a received `MACH_NOTIFY_DEAD_NAME` message as if it were a valid port right, which is then passed to `mach_port_deallocate`.
- **Lack of Validation:** The daemon fails to validate that the provided `mach_port_name_t` actually corresponds to a valid port right before attempting to deallocate it.
- **Arbitrary Port Deallocation:** An attacker can craft a malicious `MACH_NOTIFY_DEAD_NAME` message containing an arbitrary integer (port name) that, when deallocated, could free a privileged port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Port Replacement:** By deallocating a privileged port name and getting it reused, the attacker can gain control over a port they should not be able to access.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, or other system compromise depending on the specific port name that's deallocated.
- **Denial of Service:** While not stated explicitly, the possibility of crashing the syslog daemon by providing invalid port names exists.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Mach Message Spoofing:** The attacker sends a crafted `MACH_NOTIFY_DEAD_NAME` message to the `syslogd` service.
- **Service Send Right:**  The attacker needs a send-right to the `com.apple.system.logger` Mach service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the `syslogd` Mach service, which can be done from many sandboxed processes.
- **Mach Port Send Right:** The attacker needs a valid send right to the `com.apple.system.logger` Mach service, which is available through the system.sb sandbox profile.
- **Ability to craft mach messages:** The attacker needs to be able to craft Mach messages.

**Affected Systems:**
- macOS Sierra 10.12.1
- iOS < 10.2
- watchOS 3.1.3

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit code provided demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious `MACH_NOTIFY_DEAD_NAME` message to the `syslogd` service.
- This vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- The vulnerability was fixed by improved validation of mach port names in `syslogd`.
