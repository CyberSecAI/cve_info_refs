- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The kintone mobile for Android application fails to properly verify SSL server certificates when using WebView.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, specifically a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the vulnerable device and the server, for instance, by setting up a malicious wireless access point. The attacker needs to be capable of performing MitM attacks.
