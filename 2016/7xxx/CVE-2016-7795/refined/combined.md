| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-29 08:22:54 UTC  ``` It was found that systemd fails an assertion in manager_invoke_notify_message when a zero-length message is received over its notification socket. After failing the assertion, PID 1 hangs in the pause system call, making no longer possible to start and stop daemons or cleanly reboot the system. Inetd-style services managed by systemd no longer accept connections.  Since the notification socket, /run/systemd/notify, is world-writable, this allows a local user to perform a denial-of-service attack against systemd.  PoC:  NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""  Upstream bug report:  <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234>  CVE request:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/28/9>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-09-29 08:23:33 UTC  ```  Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1380287](show_bug.cgi?id=1380287 "CLOSED ERRATA - systemd: Assertion failure when PID 1 receives a zero-length message over notify socket [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-29 10:55:19 UTC  ``` This fix was applied upstream:  <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/531ac2b2349da02acc9c382849758e07eb92b020>  Upstream bug also indicates that the problem was likely introduced via this change, added in v219:  <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/d875aa8ce10b458dc218c0d98f4a82c8904d6d03>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2016-09-30 13:11:23 UTC  ``` Additional upstream fixes:  <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/9987750e7a4c62e0eb8473603150596ba7c3a015> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/8523bf7dd514a3a2c6114b7b8fb8f308b4f09fc4>  The second commit reverts the original fix linked in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c3).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c9)  Andrej Nemec    2016-10-03 07:26:58 UTC  ``` References:  <https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/how_to_crash_systemd_in_one_tweet>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2016-10-05 11:49:12 UTC  ``` [CVE-2016-7796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7796) was moved to a separate [bug 1381911](show_bug.cgi?id=1381911 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-7796 systemd: freeze when PID 1 receives a zero-length message over notify socket"), as those CVEs affect different systemd versions.  Only the fix for [CVE-2016-7796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7796) make the assert causing [CVE-2016-7795](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7795) reachable.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-04 08:55:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2016:2610 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2610.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1380286#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-11-09 16:49:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2016:2694 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-2694.html>   ``` |  |

## Description

[![@AGWA](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321605?u=aa3da3f652578f78de9a60d7b07d9cd875e34ec3&v=4&size=48)](/AGWA)[AGWA](https://github.com/AGWA)opened [on Sep 28, 2016](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234#issue-179861824)

systemd fails an assertion in [manager\_invoke\_notify\_message](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b8fafaf4a1cffd02389d61ed92ca7acb1b8c739c/src/core/manager.c#L1666) when a zero-length message is received over /run/systemd/notify. This allows a local user to perform a denial-of-service attack against PID 1.

Proof-of-concept:

```
NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""

```

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way systemd handled empty notification messages. A local attacker could use this flaw to make systemd freeze its execution, preventing further management of system services, system shutdown, or zombie process collection via systemd. (CVE-2016-7795)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the udev device manager automatically enabled all memory banks on IBM z System installations. As a consequence, hot plug memory was enabled automatically, which was incorrect. With this update, system architecture checks have been added to the udev rules to address the problem. As a result, hot plug memory is no longer automatically enabled. (BZ#1381123)

# RHSA-2016:2694 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: systemd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2694)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the way systemd handled empty notification messages. A local attacker could use this flaw to make systemd freeze its execution, preventing further management of system services, system shutdown, or zombie process collection via systemd. (CVE-2016-7795)

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the udev device manager automatically enabled all memory banks on IBM z System installations. As a consequence, hot plug memory was enabled automatically, which was incorrect. With this update, system architecture checks have been added to the udev rules to address the problem. As a result, hot plug memory is no longer automatically enabled. (BZ#1375603)

## Description

[![@AGWA](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321605?u=aa3da3f652578f78de9a60d7b07d9cd875e34ec3&v=4&size=48)](/AGWA)[AGWA](https://github.com/AGWA)opened [on Sep 28, 2016](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234#issue-179861824)

systemd fails an assertion in [manager\_invoke\_notify\_message](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b8fafaf4a1cffd02389d61ed92ca7acb1b8c739c/src/core/manager.c#L1666) when a zero-length message is received over /run/systemd/notify. This allows a local user to perform a denial-of-service attack against PID 1.

Proof-of-concept:

```
NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""

```

## How to Crash Systemd in One Tweet

The following command, when run as *any* user, will crash systemd:

`NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""`

After running this command, PID 1 is hung in the `pause` system call.
You can no longer start and stop daemons. inetd-style services no longer
accept connections. You cannot cleanly reboot the system. The system
feels generally unstable (e.g. ssh and su hang for 30 seconds since
systemd is now integrated with the login system). All of this can be
caused by a command that's short enough to fit in a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/781210293632315392).

Edit (2016-09-28 21:34): Some people can only reproduce if they [wrap the command in a `while true` loop](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4234#issuecomment-250289253). Yay non-determinism!

The bug is remarkably banal. The above systemd-notify command sends a
zero-length message to the world-accessible UNIX domain socket located
at `/run/systemd/notify`. PID 1 receives the message and
[fails
an assertion that the message length is greater than zero](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b8fafaf4a1cffd02389d61ed92ca7acb1b8c739c/src/core/manager.c#L1666).
Despite the banality, the bug is serious, as it allows any local user
to trivially perform a denial-of-service attack against a critical
system component.

The immediate question raised by this bug is what kind of quality
assurance process would allow such a simple bug to exist
for over two years (it was [introduced](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/5ba6985b6c8ef85a8bcfeb1b65239c863436e75b#diff-ab78220e12703ee63fa1e6a2caa16bebR1325) in systemd 209). Isn't the empty
string an obvious test case? One would hope that PID 1, the most
important userspace process, would have better quality assurance than
this. Unfortunately, it seems that crashes of PID 1 are not unusual,
as a quick glance through the systemd commit log reveals commit messages
such as:

* [coredump: turn off coredump collection only when PID 1 crashes, not when journald crashes](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/c8091d92d5258afee017506ebac086da2f99ee91)
* [coredump: make sure to handle crashes of PID 1 and journald special](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/c907cba919a1e9840859296f192f3a55345ff29c)
* [coredump: turn off coredump collection entirely after journald or PID 1 crashed](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/5157879b757bffce3da0a68ca207753569e8627d)

Systemd's problems run far deeper than this one bug. Systemd is
defective by design. Writing bug-free software is extremely difficult.
Even good programmers would inevitably introduce bugs into a project of
the scale and complexity of systemd. However, good programmers recognize
the difficulty of writing bug-free software and understand the importance
of designing software in a way that minimizes the likelihood of bugs or
at least reduces their impact. The systemd developers understand none of this,
opting to cram an enormous amount of unnecessary complexity into PID 1,
which runs as root and is written in a memory-unsafe language.

Some degree of complexity is to be expected, as systemd provides a number
of useful and compelling features (although they did not invent them; they
were just the first to aggressively market them). Whether or
not systemd has made the right trade-off between features and complexity
is a matter of debate. What is not debatable is that systemd's complexity does
not belong in PID 1. As Rich Felker explained,
[the only job of PID 1 is to execute the real
init system and reap zombies](http://ewontfix.com/14/). Furthermore, the real init system, even
when running as a non-PID 1 process, should be structured in a modular
way such that a failure in one of the riskier components does not bring
down the more critical components. For instance, a failure in the
daemon management code should not prevent the system from
being cleanly rebooted.

In particular, any code that accepts messages from untrustworthy sources
like systemd-notify should run in a dedicated process as a unprivileged user. The unprivileged process parses and validates
messages before passing them along to the privileged process. This is
called privilege separation and has been a best practice in security-aware
software for over a decade. Systemd, by contrast, does text
parsing on messages from untrusted sources, in C, running as root in
PID 1.
If you think systemd doesn't need privilege separation because it only
parses messages from local users, keep in mind that in the Internet
era, local attacks tend to acquire remote vectors. Consider
[Shellshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29),
or the presentation at this year's systemd conference which is titled
"[Talking to systemd from a Web Browser](https://cfp.systemd.io/en/systemdconf_2016/public/events/21)."

Systemd's "we don't make mistakes" attitude towards security can
be seen in other places, such as
[this code from the `main()` function of PID 1](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/831d3dc8d7ab2719c90485274b537f4a7882fe66/src/core/main.c#L1397-L1399):

```
/* Disable the umask logic */
if (getpid() == 1)
        umask(0);

```

Setting a umask of 0 means that, by default, any file created by systemd
will be world-readable and -writable. Systemd defines a macro called `RUN_WITH_UMASK`
which is used to temporarily set a more restrictive umask when systemd needs to create a file
with different permissions. This is backwards. The default umask should be restrictive,
so forgetting to change the umask when creating a file would result in a file
that obviously doesn't work. This is called fail-safe design. Instead systemd is fail-open, so forgetting to change the umask
([which
has already happened twice](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/8612da973d30c5a9530fa1b6b3d449147b5a3324)) creates a file that works but is a potential security vulnerability.

The Linux ecosystem has fallen behind other operating systems in
writing secure and robust software. While Microsoft was hardening
Windows and Apple was developing iOS, open source software became
complacent. However, I see improvement on the horizon. [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) and [Shellshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29)
were wake-up calls that have led to increased scrutiny of open source
software. Go and Rust are compelling, safe languages for writing the type
of systems software that has traditionally been written in C.
Systemd is dangerous not only because it is introducing hundreds of
thousands of lines of complex C code without any
regard to longstanding security practices like privilege
separation or fail-safe design, but because it is setting itself up to be irreplaceable.
Systemd is far more than an init system: it is becoming a secondary
operating system kernel, providing a log server, a device manager,
a container manager, a login manager, a DHCP client, a DNS resolver,
and an NTP client. These services are largely interdependent and
provide non-standard interfaces for other applications to use.
This makes any one component of systemd hard to replace,
which will prevent more secure alternatives from gaining adoption in the
future.

Consider systemd's DNS resolver. DNS is a complicated, security-sensitive
protocol. In August 2014, Lennart Poettering declared that "[systemd-resolved
is now a pretty complete caching DNS and LLMNR stub resolver](https://lwn.net/Articles/609740/)." In reality, [systemd-resolved
failed to implement](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/592) *any* of the [documented best practices to protect against DNS cache poisoning](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5452). It was vulnerable to [Dan
Kaminsky's cache poisoning attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky#Flaw_in_DNS) which was fixed in every other DNS server during
a massive coordinated response in 2008 (and which had been fixed in djbdns in 1999).
Although systemd doesn't force you to use systemd-resolved, it exposes a non-standard interface over
DBUS which they [encourage
applications to use](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-resolved.service.html) instead of the standard DNS protocol over port 53. If applications
follow this recommendation, it will become impossible to replace systemd-resolved with a more
secure DNS resolver, unless that DNS resolver opts to emulate systemd's non-standard DBUS API.

It is not too late to stop this. Although almost every Linux distribution
now uses systemd for their init system, init was a soft target for
systemd because the systems they replaced were so bad. That's not
true for the other services which systemd is trying to replace such as
network management, DNS, and NTP. Systemd offers very few compelling
features over existing implementations, but does carry a large amount
of risk. If you're a system administrator, resist the replacement
of existing services and hold out for replacements that are
more secure. If you're an application developer, do not use systemd's
non-standard interfaces. There will be better alternatives in the
future that are more secure than what we have now. But adopting them will
only be possible if systemd has not destroyed the modularity and standards-compliance
that make innovation possible.

I found I had to use a "while true" loop around that before it would trigger, as it seems it doesn't reliably trigger with every attempt (curious what combination of circumstances trigger it?)

Just out of curiosity, why didn't you contact the RedHat security team to responsibly disclose this vulnerability? (the majority of systemd development work is funded by, and done by, RedHat employees)

This article starts with a bug. Note, it's a pretty irrelevant one that doesn't appear to be reproducible on recent builds.

Then it brings up a few other debatable issues, and then it incorrectly generalizes that systemd security is terrible. I say debatable because for example parsing command line parameters isn't something people usually delegate to a separate process.

Unfortunately, it also ignores all the great systemd security features it has added for the average Linux user (such as private tmp, and cgroups), and in fact all the other great features it has.

It isn't about parsing command line. It's about parsing text coming from an untrusted socket where anyone can write to, at runtime, in something that runs as PID 1. Not exactly the same thing.

> Unfortunately, it also ignores all the great systemd security features it has added for the average Linux user (such as private tmp, and cgroups), and in fact all the other great features it has.

What it's debatable is that systemd add those things. I use private-tmp, namespaces, cgroups and more... and i don't have systemd installed in my system.

And anyway, cgroups are NOT a security feature; they can help to get a better security, but they aren't a security measure.

Private tmp (being one application of namespaces) and cgroups are features of the Linux kernel, not systemd.

Wish I had the budget and team to write a "proper" replacements similar to Solaris 10/11's service management framework, but in user mode.

The Unix philosophy is that you do one thing and to do it well.

That means that you should have a program reaping zombies and do nothing else.

You should have a program that starts the system services taking their dependencies into account. The oldfashioned way is to do them in a specific order, the new way is to calculate the dependencies.
You should have a simple program that asks for an IP address on a network interface and does nothing else but to assign that IP address on that interface.

All these are simple programs that can be reasonably comprehended and verified.

Once you integrate all this, the complexity increases, and the amount of work to maintain the code base increases super-linearly. And as agwa says: the consequences of a problem become more troubling. Use the tools that are already there. The "runlevel switching" may want to accept "requests" from userspace. Make that a root-only socket or something.

If you want to make users able to switch runlevels or other "normally root" stuff, delegate that to "sudo" or modern variants of such tools. Or make a daemon that will accept commands from the normal users and passes them on as a privileged one. Again a bug somewhere in this process has the problems contained.

I agree with a large part of this. The only things I disagree about:

1. As a user and hobbyist system admin, systemd has numerous advantages over sysv init(which was the only previous init system to be installed by default on most distributions). So I would not say it has "very few" advantages over other init systems (I haven't used the other more modern init systems enough to have an informed opinion there). I also think having one standard init system between most distributions is very nice, so the fragmentation of the previous non-sysv solutions annoyed me.

2. Systemd, by definition, does not use a "proprietary" DBUS API nor "proprietary" interfaces. See <http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proprietary> if you don't believe me. Anyone can legally and practically implement a systemd DNS service clone that communicates via d-bus exactly like the systemd one, if they wish. That being said, I agree that it can still be a problem since it forces others to either imitate systemd's interface or get applications to use something standardized instead/as well.

1. You misread me. I acknowledge that systemd's init system functionality has compelling features, even if terribly implemented. It's the other functionality -- DNS, DHCP, NTP -- where it doesn't offer anything new.

2. Fair enough. I replaced "proprietary" with "non-standard," which is what I meant.

People don't seem to understand how assert works. In release builds `assert` should be no-op. <https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/assert/assert.h#L44>
First of all assert is a debug tool, not error handling mechanism. Secondly, exiting with abort signal isn't very good error handling mechanism for `systemd`.

On the other hand, arguing that this makes `systemd` defective is hypocritical considering that Go FAQ says

> Go doesn't provide assertions. They are undeniably convenient, but our experience
> has been that programmers use them as a crutch to avoid thinking about proper
> error handling and reporting.

systemd's assertions are enabled in release builds. However, systemd doesn't exit when an assertion fails. Instead it hangs in the `pause` system call. This prevents the whole system from crashing, although the system is left in a degraded state.

I would have to say that this bug supports Golang's position on assertions.

Nobody I know likes systemd, it's too intrusive in user space and goes way against the core Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.

The sooner systemd disappears out of the Unix/Linux eco system the better.

Thank you for exposing this bug. We tried it on our up-to-date RedHat 7.2 systems and sure enough they crashed very hard.

In some parts of SystemD they seem to use "bad coding practices from textbook":

 `} else if (startswith(option, "keyfile-offset=")) {` `if (safe_atou(option+15, &arg_keyfile_offset) < 0) {
log_error("keyfile-offset= parse failure, ignoring.");
return 0;
}`

Do you see "option+15"? "15" here is a magic number, denoting the length of "keyfile-offset=":

The linux "basesystem" is called the "kernel" and is normally named vmlinuz. systemd IS NOT the BASESYSTEM of ANY LINUX distro - it is a service manager - which used to handled by initd - which only did one thing - init processes. It IS possible to TEST for magic numbers as well as review code. Good coding principles: 1. DRY - Don't repeat yourself - strings should exist in one place and be declared const. The length of the string if used often should be should be recorded as a singleton value also marked const at initialization. 2. Initialization is Instantiation. Goes without saying. There should not be ANY arithmatic with static numbers when doing text parsing. +15 and +XYZ is the exact same number of instructions in assembly. There is no code savings or clock cycle savings.

I continue not to understand why so *many* high-profile distributions' Release Configuration Managers drank the Flavor-Aid.

And the bad part is not that they did, but that *because they did*, packages are no longer required to have initscripts for *sane* inits, meaning that you have no choice: you either run systemd (read: shoot yourself in the head), or you *build initscripts by hand for every package you want to run*.

The only thing worse is reading the replies from systemd partisans when it's explained to them why the choices systemd's design makes are bad engineering practice -- am I the only one who thinks the structure of these replies is way too similar to the replies one hears from Trump supporters when it's explained why *he* is bad engineering practice? :-)

Added this article to my list of "Why systemd is bad" articles; added the supporting commenters to my list of "people never to hire or recommend for responsible software engineering jobs".

Gnome and developer hours available basically.

With Gnome yanking out consolekit support in favor of logind, and logind being part of the system package (not only is everything in the same git, they are all in the same src tree! When the LFS team shifts to eudev because extracting udev from the larger systemd source ball is too much effort you know something is up.) not moving to systemd becomes a hard sell.

Frankly the whole consolekit/logind thing seems overdesigned and aimed squarely at reproducing Microsoft's Active Directory. Is some corporate admin wants that, let him enable it. There is crap all reason for shipping this on every distro unless you think every last of your users are idiots (oh wait, Gnomes already do...).

#### Anonymous on 2016-10-06 at 08:47:

wouldn’t it be enough to have a simple syntax which can do everything systemd init syntax can?

Something like this?

`MOUNTPOINT=/sys/fs/fuse/connections
depend() {
need localmount
}
start() {
ebegin "Starting fuse"
if ! grep -qw fuse /proc/filesystems; then
modprobe fuse >/dev/null 2>&1 || eerror $? "Error loading fuse module"
fi
if grep -qw fusectl /proc/filesystems && \
! grep -qw $MOUNTPOINT /proc/mounts; then
mount -t fusectl none $MOUNTPOINT >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
eerror $? "Error mounting control filesystem"
fi
eend ${?}
}
stop() {
ebegin "Stopping fuse"
if grep -qw $MOUNTPOINT /proc/mounts; then
umount $MOUNTPOINT >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
eerror $? "Error unmounting control filesystem"
fi
eend ${?}
}`

That’s the syntax of OpenRC. You’ll notice the declarative dependencies along with the simple scripting in start() and stop().

And since it’s a scripting language, the answer to "can it do everything systemd can" is simply: Yes, it can.

A simple standard along with some convenience functions and building on existing tools already provides most of the functionality of systemd.

It's only because of the declarative syntax of systemd. If we could reverse engineer the systemd syntax with something more stable, we could go back to business as usual. Init scripts are hard to write. Writing configurations that are standard are easy. Systemd just happens to be bad code around a good idea - declarative definitions of services. However, trying to be everything and do everything is causing the bigger problems.

My system hangs because it takes just a little longer for all my items to come online. And that in turns brings 32GB, Core-I7 4720HQ to its knees on a reboot. I always have to restart the display-manager because too many things are starting at once.

Believe me, should be obvious from this thread, NOT using systemd would *absolutely* be the first choice for many of us.

Unfortunately, large numbers of us have -- through no choice of our own -- been forced to adopt it basically at gunpoint, as our corporate linuces have betrayed us (yes, we mean you RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, et al)...

Where we can, we *are* attempting to move to NON-systemd linuces (Alpine, Devuan, et cetera). Personally, I like many other features of RHEL/CentOS, but systemd may be a deal breaker. (Take note, RHEL. You're actively driving away part of your formerly-loyal installed user base.)

That being observed, no, *every* program with a bug is not 'defective by design'.

Systemd however, *IS* -- due to what's been pointed out repeatedly by many individuals, in many venues, upon many occasions. The fundamental underpinnings of the design philosophy is critically flawed, as it not only violates the *first* premise(1) of UNIX philosophy 'do ONE thing, and do it well', but completely files in the face of it.

An init system (e.g. 'system management loader') does *NOT* need to take over power management, to control mount points, to handle disk encryption, to manage DNS, to control host naming, or locale, or time management, to add cron-style scheduling, to manage the network interfaces, to control sockets or inetd, or manage login sessions, just to name a few of it's excesses.

Add to that, questionable design choices such as opting for binary logging instead of cleartext, and you're simply adding fuel to the already large pyre a great many of us would gladly toss systemd onto.

Does init.d have it's own flaws. You bet.

Are the intentions of those working on systemd well-meaning? Sure.

Are *some* of the design *objectives* good ones? Sure.

But, much more importantly, are the design *decisions* good? For the most part, certainly no.

Many are fundamentally flawed for many of the same reasons Gnome is a complete disaster. They are overreaching, overcomplicated, with a snowballing morass of poorly written code, a open disdain for modern coding best practices, and design creep that apparently will continue expand and try to take over the world -- though creep doesn't even begin to address the avarice with which systemd claws for control of things that it has no business controling.

Importing flawed, monolithic, Windows-style design concepts into Linux is a poison pill.

The design concepts that *should* be in use here revolve around KISS -- keep it simple, stupid.

Instead, systemd is an Ode to Zawinksi's Law.

I'm waiting for the day it's announced that systemd has added an email client...

> This is a fair point, but it also isn’t a fundamental design element worthy of calls to abandon systemd. As most, it would justify a call to fork systemd and reverse the umask default.

I liked this bit. Because it is a fundamental design element when the developer team developing your software are completely unwilling to consider any suggestions from the outside. And you know that, because you suggested a fork right away, which of course, never would gain any traction if the fork is only about default policies.

I bet If I were to open a bug proposing to reverse the default behavior to a fail-safe behavior it would just be closed as wontfix with one or more arrogant "systemd is perfect as it is" comments below it. This gives good indications towards the design goals of systemd. It is not meant to be a solid and reliable foundation for Linux systems. That would be boring. It is meant to be an attractive sham-bandwagon to jump onto, selling the feel of flashy and new. Fail-safe behavior gets in the way of that, even if systemd cannot uphold the things it promises for every user.

So yes, it is worth abandoning systemd exactly due to issues like this.

Andrew, thank you for this very lucid article.

I have been *philosophically* uneasy with systemd ever since it rolled out on Arch and have read many opinions and counter-opinions on the matter. A few months ago I put a Manjaro spin (Fluxbox & openRC) on my laptop and everything worked just fine. I think, in light of the above arguments, I've reached the tipping point to take a deep breath and point my primary Arch system to the openRC alternatives. Thank you.

Software generally has N-bugs-per-X-lines-of-code, with N and X varying by program type and the care of the development team.

However a program with 20x the lines of code as another program almost always has more bugs. Systemd has about 20x the lines of code as OpenRC.

Recently i kicked Arch Linux to the curb and switched to Void Linux because of systemd.

This is typical for systemd developers - force it onto everyone, then refuse to fix fatal bugs.

You can see this in countless issue reports at their tracker.

The only sane conclusion is to avoid systemd.

As a security analyst for a Fortune 50 company, you can bet I'll be trying this formally. A rogue employee DoSing a system? That's a big problem for us. We throw a lot of money at Red Hat; a hole like this would set off a lot of panic for our IT teams, and some of that will be aimed at RH. Getting an unprivileged shell prompt isn't all that hard, sadly. Parlaying that into a DoS with a short one-liner is a HUGE issue. Strauss' reply isn't reassuring, it's frightening... and will likely make its way into my gap writeup, so the CISO can consider it. Our business is all about managing risk, and it sounds like Red Hat's systemd team is taking, and exposing us to, unnecessary risk.

Sorry I am new to the systemd wars and there is something that I do not understand: If most people like the features that systemd offers but many do not like how they are being implemented, why there is not a fork?

[Reply](/blog/post/how_to_crash_systemd_in_one_tweet/comment/31866)

#### Anonymous on 2016-10-02 at 18:18:

The issues people have with systemd mean forking it wouldn't solve the problem. Systemd flies in the face of Unix philosophy, by having one program try to do it all. Forking it would never fix that, and there are other good alternatives out there such as runit and openrc. There was a fork at one point called uselessd, where the developers tried to remove as much of the unnecessary code in systemd as possible. The problem was that systemd was so large by then that maintaining the fork with only a few people was too much work, so it died. If you don't like systemd, the best option is to just not use it. There are other programs that can do the same thing as systemd, it's just you have to use more than one program (which is the smarter way to do it imo, with systemd you have a single point of failure, which is not good, and with as much code as systemd has, more errors are more likely to occur).

Of those that care most people both like what it offers an are relatively happy with it's implementation.

No doubt systemd is a major change from sysvinit and some people just don't like change.

most people just want their programs to work. Systemd was pushed as a dependency of Gnome - which many people need - at least partly due to systemd devs having a say in Gnome development.

[Reply](/blog/post/how_to_crash_systemd_in_one_tweet/comment/31902)

#### Anonymous on 2016-10-09 at 13:59:

Because:

A: there are already multiple alternatives if all you want it dependency based init. But the scope of systemd is creeping ever wider.

B: thanks to the scope creep more and more depends on systemd being present (particularly the stuff coming out of Freedesktop). Gnome for instance wants logind to be present to handle "sessions". These days Logind is responsible for handling sleep and hibernate, with formerly independent powerd/powerkit acting as a compatibility shim. Wayland will depend on Logind and Polkit for managing access to tings like keyboard and GPU.

You forgot that the most important reason for *not* using it is that it is totally undebuggable. You cannot strace it, cannot gdb it etc... Just because it's PID1. Can you imagine a system without strace ? It exists with systemd cancering more and more of your system, and it's a real pain each time I end up on such a self-sustaining system which refuses to cooperate with humans.

I'm not against systemd in principle (although I don't use distros/versions based on it, as I've had problems with it in the past) - although I do get very disturbed by reports of the ever-increasing scope of its control.

I AM against not having the option whether or not to use it (and I get the red mist when I read that systemd is permanently welded into a particular distro/version, and if I don't like it, I should go elsewhere.)

One thing really puzzles me. We now have devuan - systemd-free fork of debian. Apparently (based on Google searches at any rate) no one has tried producing a systemd-free fork of Red Hat or CentOS 7 (or any other RPM-based distro) (or, if someone has, he/she isn't letting on.) Why not? Given the existence of devuan, I can't believe that it would be an impossible task.

I'm late to the party on this, and doubt anyone will see my comment, but after reading "...Been saying it for a while...systemd is ready made for a rootkit." I felt I had to.

There are already rootkits in the wild. Systemd is a nasty piece of work. I'm back to slackware now and it took eons to get a clean install. My whole system was junked.

I can't go into detail because it would take a dissertation to explain everything and as a linux user of more than 20 years still don't fully understand, but basically it involves the use of systemd, containers - and actually uses portions of selinux against you. You think you su in bash but you're not root. Real root is 'above' root. All formatting say /dev/sda1 does is format the container equivalent of what's called /dev/sda1 so it's a nightmare to break out of. Shit is copied back on reinstall of other systems.

Sorry for incorrect terms (English second language).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit).

Use CVE-2016-7795.

>> Older distros are affected differently I think: no assertion is

Use CVE-2016-7796.

From: Andrew Ayer <agwa@...rewayer.name>

Subject: CVE Request: systemd v209+: local denial-of-service attack

systemd[1] fails an assertion in manager_invoke_notify_message[2] when
a zero-length message is received over its notification socket.
After failing the assertion, PID 1 hangs in the pause system call.
It is no longer possible to start and stop daemons or cleanly reboot
the system. Inetd-style services managed by systemd no longer accept
connections.

Since the notification socket, /run/systemd/notify, is world-writable,
this allows a local user to perform a denial-of-service attack against
systemd.

Proof-of-concept:

        NOTIFY_SOCKET=/run/systemd/notify systemd-notify ""

This vulnerability is present in all versions of systemd since at
least v209[3].

This has been reported to systemd.[4]

[2] <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/b8fafaf4a1cffd02389d61ed92ca7acb1b8c739c/src/core/manager.c#L1666>
