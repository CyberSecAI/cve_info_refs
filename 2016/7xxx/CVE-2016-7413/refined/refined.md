Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7413:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

*   The content directly references CVE-2016-7413 and provides a description that aligns with the official CVE description, indicating a use-after-free vulnerability in PHP's `wddx_stack_destroy` function related to `wddx_deserialize` when a recordset field element lacks an end-tag.
*   The provided content is also specific to the PHP versions affected as mentioned in the CVE description.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `wddx_stack_destroy` function within the `ext/wddx/wddx.c` file of PHP. It is triggered by a missing end-tag for a recordset field element in a WDDX XML document, which leads to a use-after-free condition when `wddx_deserialize` is called. This means that memory is accessed after it has been freed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Use-after-free vulnerability.
    *   Improper handling of XML document structures during deserialization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS).
    *   The vulnerability could possibly lead to other unspecified impacts, potentially including arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated and is based on the general nature of use-after-free vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers.
    *   Exploitation through a crafted WDDX XML document. Specifically, the malicious document would be missing an end tag for a recordset field element.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted WDDX XML document to a vulnerable PHP application.
    *   No specific attacker position or special privileges are mentioned other than being remote.

**3. Additional Details from the Content**

*   The Tenable document mentions that the vulnerability is present in PHP versions before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11.
*   The Tenable document also mentions that the vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5, a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, and is labeled as "Critical."
*   The github commit details the code-level fix to address the bug
*   The redhat.com content mentions that this CVE is fixed in RHSA-2018:1296.
