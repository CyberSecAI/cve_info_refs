- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in VMware Workstation via Cortado ThinPrint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in VMware Workstation running on Windows.
- **Attack vectors**: A Windows-based Virtual Machine (VM) can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to execute code within a Windows VM, and virtual printing must be enabled in VMware Workstation. Virtual printing is not enabled by default.
