{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `get_task_ioprio()` function accesses the `task->io_context` without holding the task lock, leading to a race condition with `exit_io_context()`, and resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition",
      "Incorrect locking"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a crash by triggering the use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation through a crafted application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "Affected_code": "`block/ioprio.c`",
        "Patch_details": "The fix involves acquiring the task lock before accessing task->io_context and releasing the lock afterward.",
        "Reproducer": "A reproducer program is provided that forks multiple processes, some of which continually call `ioprio_set` and `ioprio_get` syscalls. This program triggers the race condition and leads to a KASAN report."
