| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1382305#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2016-10-06 09:52:08 UTC  ``` .initialize_dsc_parser doesn't validate the parameter is a dict type before using it.  This is a security issue, because it can be abused to escape the -dSAFER sandbox.  This allows a Denial of Service, arbitrary code execution.  Upstream bug :  - [Bug 697190](show_bug.cgi?id=697190 "CLOSED NOTABUG - f15 alpha: after upgrade evolution has no email") - .initialize_dsc_parser doesn't validate the parameter is a dict type before using it. <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697190>  Upstream patch :  - DSC parser - validate parameters <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;h=875a0095f37626a721c7ff57d606a0f95af03913>  Reference : <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/37>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1382305#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2016-11-01 08:43:06 UTC  ```  Created ghostscript tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1390489](show_bug.cgi?id=1390489 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2016-7979 ghostscript: Type confusion in .initialize_dsc_parser allows remote code execution [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1382305#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-04 10:10:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0014 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0014.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1382305#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-04 10:11:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:0013 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0013.html>   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2016-7976.

There currently isn't a separate CVE ID for the earlier impact that
occurred when "b" was in the mode argument to popen. The question of
whether popen will execute anyway (even with the 'b" character) is,
more or less, a reachability concern in this context, and doesn't mean
that a second vulnerability needs to be defined.

Debian Bug     : 839118 839260 839841 839845 839846 840451

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or information disclosure if a specially crafted Postscript file is
processed.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

# GPL Ghostscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GPL Ghostscript, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ghostscript-gpl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.20-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.20-r1** |

### Background

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GPL Ghostscript and the
bundled OpenJPEG. Please review the CVE identifiers and GLSA-201612-26
(OpenJPEG) referenced below for additional information.

Note: GPL Ghostscript in Gentoo since app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.20-r1
no longer bundles OpenJPEG.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted PostScript file or PDF using GPL Ghostscript possibly resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or
a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GPL Ghostscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.20-r1"

```

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Ghostscript suite contains utilities for rendering PostScript and PDF documents. Ghostscript translates PostScript code to common bitmap formats so that the code can be displayed or printed.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the ghostscript functions getenv, filenameforall and .libfile did not honor the -dSAFER option, usually used when processing untrusted documents, leading to information disclosure. A specially crafted postscript document could read environment variable, list directory and retrieve file content respectively, from the target. (CVE-2013-5653, CVE-2016-7977)
* It was found that the ghostscript function .setdevice suffered a use-after-free vulnerability due to an incorrect reference count. A specially crafted postscript document could trigger code execution in the context of the gs process. (CVE-2016-7978)
* It was found that the ghostscript function .initialize\_dsc\_parser did not validate its parameter before using it, allowing a type confusion flaw. A specially crafted postscript document could cause a crash code execution in the context of the gs process. (CVE-2016-7979)
* It was found that ghostscript did not sufficiently check the validity of parameters given to the .sethalftone5 function. A specially crafted postscript document could cause a crash, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the gs process. (CVE-2016-8602)
