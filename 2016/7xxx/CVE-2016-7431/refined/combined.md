# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA are affected:

* SIMATIC NET CP 443-1 OPC UA: All versions

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the origin timestamp check functionality of ntpd 4.2.8p9. A specially crafted, unauthenticated network packet can be used to reset the expected origin timestamp for target peers. Legitimate replies from targeted peers will fail the origin timestamp check (TEST2), causing the reply to be dropped and creating a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2016-9042](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-9042) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

Multiple buffer overflows in the ctl\_put\* functions in NTP before 4.2.8p10 and 4.3.x before 4.3.94 allow remote authenticated users to have unspecified impact via a long variable.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.15    [OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)

The MATCH\_ASSOC function in NTP before Version 4.2.8p9 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows remote attackers to cause an out-of-bounds reference via an addpeer request with a large hmode value.

[CVE-2016-2518](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2518) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to Port UDP/123 of an affected device.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and follow the recommendations in the product manual.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-211752](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-211752.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

SUMMARY

All versions of the SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA contain multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying third party
component NTP.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA (6GK7443-1UX00-
0XE0):
All versions

Currently no remediation is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to port udp/123 of an affected device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

SSA-211752

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-7705

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1548

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the
peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate
server responses.
It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been
changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.

#### Description

Zero Origin timestamp problems were fixed by [Bug 2945](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2945) in ntp-4.2.8p6. However, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp checks.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p9 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)
* Properly monitor your `ntpd` instances, and auto-restart `ntpd` (without `-g`) if it stops running.

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.

## NTP.org ntpd contains multiple denial of service vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#633847

Original Release Date: 2016-11-21 | Last Revised: 2017-11-20

---

### Overview

NTP.org ntpd versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94 contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.

### Description

| NTP.org's ntpd, versions ntp-4.2.7p385 up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9 and ntp-4.3.0 up to but not including ntp-4.3.94, contain multiple denial of service vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-476**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**: NULL Pointer Dereference -** CVE-2016-9311According to NTP.org, "ntpd does not enable trap service by default. If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service. Affects Windows only."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-9310According to NTP.org, "An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified, a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps, disabling legitimate monitoring. A remote, unauthenticated, network attacker can trigger this vulnerability."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7427According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode replay prevention functionality can be abused. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2016-7428According to NTP.org, "The broadcast mode of NTP is expected to only be used in a trusted network. If the broadcast network is accessible to an attacker, a potentially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in ntpd's broadcast mode poll interval enforcement functionality can be abused. To limit abuse, ntpd restricts the rate at which each broadcast association will process incoming packets. ntpd will reject broadcast mode packets that arrive before the poll interval specified in the preceding broadcast packet expires. An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-9312According to NTP.org, "If a vulnerable instance of ntpd on Windows receives a crafted malicious packet that is "too big", ntpd will stop working."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7431According to NTP.org, "Zero Origin timestamp problems were fixed by Bug 2945 in ntp-4.2.8p6. However, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp checks."[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-7434According to NTP.org, "If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet."[**CWE-605**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/605.html)**: Multiple Binds to the Same Port -** CVE-2016-7429According to NTP.org, "When ntpd receives a server response on a socket that corresponds to a different interface than was used for the request, the peer structure is updated to use the interface for new requests. If ntpd is running on a host with multiple interfaces in separate networks and the operating system doesn't check source address in received packets (e.g. rp\_filter on Linux is set to 0), an attacker that knows the address of the source can send a packet with spoofed source address which will cause ntpd to select wrong interface for the source and prevent it from sending new requests until the list of interfaces is refreshed, which happens on routing changes or every 5 minutes by default. If the attack is repeated often enough (once per second), ntpd will not be able to synchronize with the source."[**CWE-410**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/410.html)**: Insufficient Resource Pool -** CVE-2016-7426According to NTP.org, "When ntpd is configured with rate limiting for all associations (restrict default limited in ntp.conf), the limits are applied also to responses received from its configured sources. An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources."[**CWE-682**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/682.html)**: Incorrect Calculation -** CVE-2016-7433According to NTP.org, "Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulae have been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly."For more information, please see NTP.org's [security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#November_2016_ntp_4_2_8p9_NTP_Se).The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2016-9312. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to perform a denial of service on ntpd. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Implement BCP-38.**Use "restrict default noquery ..." in your ntp.conf file. Only allow mode 6 queries from trusted networks and hosts.**Apply an update**Upgrade to [4.2.8p9](nwtime.org/ntp428p9_release), or later, from the NTP Project Download Page or the NTP Public Services Project Download Page.**Monitor ntpd**Properly monitor your ntpd instances, and auto-restart ntpd (without -g) if it stops running. |

CVE Name: CVE-2016-7426, CVE-2016-7427, CVE-2016-7428, CVE-2016-7431,
CVE-2016-7433, CVE-2016-7434, CVE-2016-9310, CVE-2016-9311
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
Trap is a mechanism to collect NTP daemon information from remote.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NTP suite:
CVE-2016-9311: Trap crash, Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-9310: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS
vector. Reported by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7427: Broadcast Mode Replay Prevention DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7428: Broadcast Mode Poll Interval Enforcement DoS. Reported by
Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.
CVE-2016-7431: Regression: 010-origin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass.
Reported by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra of Boston University.
CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference in \_IO\_str\_init\_static\_internal().
Reported by Magnus Stubman.
CVE-2016-7426: Client rate limiting and server responses. Reported by
Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat.
CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem. Reported independently
by Brian Utterback of Oracle, and by Sharon Goldberg and Aanchal Malhotra
of Boston University.
III. Impact
A remote attacker who can send a specially crafted packet to cause a
NULL pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a Denial of
Service. [CVE-2016-9311]
An exploitable configuration modification vulnerability exists in the
control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd. If, against long-standing
BCP recommendations, "restrict default noquery ..." is not specified,
a specially crafted control mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing
information disclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,
disabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote. [CVE-2016-9310]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can periodically
inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets into the broadcast
domain which, while being logged by ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject
broadcast mode packets from legitimate NTP broadcast servers.
[CVE-2016-7427]
An attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can send specially
crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the broadcast domain which, while
being logged by ntpd, will cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets
from legitimate NTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7428]
Origin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6. However, subsequent
timestamp validation checks introduced a regression in the handling of
some Zero origin timestamp checks. [CVE-2016-7431]
If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server
that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of
that crafted malicious mrulist query packet. [CVE-2016-7434]
An attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4 refid in server
response) and knows the system is (mis)configured in this way can
periodically send packets with spoofed source address to keep the rate
limiting activated and prevent ntpd from accepting valid responses
from its sources. [CVE-2016-7426]
Ntp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included
twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to
a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix
for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did
not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formulas have
been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.
[CVE-2016-7433]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce the risk associated with these attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.0]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-11.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-11.0.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-10.x.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-10.x.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-10.x.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-9.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:39/ntp-9.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp-9.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
