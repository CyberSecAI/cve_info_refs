Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7804:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the 7-Zip installer for Windows handles DLL loading. Specifically, it has an insecure DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading:** The installer does not properly restrict the locations from which it loads DLL files. This allows it to load DLLs from untrusted locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a user runs the installer while a malicious DLL is present in a directory that is searched by the installer, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed. This results in the attacker gaining code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a specific directory where the 7-Zip installer searches for DLLs. This typically involves the user placing the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer or a directory in the search path.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must then run the installer, which will trigger the loading and execution of the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to place a malicious DLL in a specific directory before running the 7-Zip installer.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They simply need a vector to place the DLL. This can be done through social engineering or exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in 7-Zip for Windows versions 16.02 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 16.03.
