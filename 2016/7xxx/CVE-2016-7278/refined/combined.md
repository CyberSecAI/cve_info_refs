## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3204059)

Published: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how:

* Microsoft browser and affected components handle objects in memory
* Microsoft browser checks Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers
* Scripting engines handle objects in memory

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3204059](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3204059).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist in the way that the affected components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could obtain information to further compromise a target system.

In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Additionally, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Hyperlink Object Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7278](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7278) | No | No |
| Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7282) | Yes | No |
| Internet Explorer Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7284](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7284) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Browsers improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Microsoft browsers, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

The update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7283) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Microsoft Browser Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when the Microsoft browsers fail to correctly apply Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers.

An attacker could trick a user into loading a page with malicious content. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to trick a user into loading a page or visiting a site. The page could also be injected into a compromised site or ad network.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the Same Origin Policy check for scripts running inside Web Workers.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for the vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Browser Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7281](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7281) | Yes | No |

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through a Microsoft browser and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected Microsoft scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
