Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** The software has a flaw that allows writing data past the intended buffer boundaries, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious code on the affected device.
- **Denial-of-service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to crash the device, making it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network access, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- The attack requires high privileges, implying an authenticated attacker with administrative access.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable I-O DATA network camera.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as administrator-level credentials, to the device.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects I-O DATA network camera products "TS-WRLP" and "TS-WRLA" with firmware versions 1.01.02 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.02.03.
- The provided source does not give specific details about the vulnerable code, how exactly the overflow occurs or what the vulnerable function is.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.8, with an attack vector of adjacent, low complexity, no user interaction needed, high impact in confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The CVSS v2 score is 5.2 with an attack vector of adjacent, low complexity, authentication required, and partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
