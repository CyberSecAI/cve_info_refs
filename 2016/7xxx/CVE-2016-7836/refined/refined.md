Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The SKYSEA Client View agent program has a flaw in how it handles authentication during TCP communication with the management console. This allows an attacker to bypass the authentication process and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient authentication in TCP communication between the SKYSEA Client View agent and the management console.
- The agent program receives commands from the management console to receive files and execute programs, which could be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on client machines where the SKYSEA Client View agent is installed.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the client system, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attackers send malicious packets impersonating the management console to the agent.
- The vulnerability is exploitable when a client device with the agent is assigned a global IP address and the communication port used by SKYSEA Client View is not blocked.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable client devices.
- They do not require any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability (as per CVSS v3 score).
- They do need to be outside the organization's network to exploit the global IP address requirement
- The attacker needs to craft malicious packets that can be mistaken for legitimate commands from the management console.
- As the JPCERT analysis states, "Attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been observed in the wild."

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects SKYSEA Client View Ver.11.221.03 and earlier.
- SKYSEA Client View Ver. 11.300.08h, 11.400.07o, 12.000.14t and 12.100.07p contain a fix for this vulnerability.
- Patches are also available for older versions through the vendor's support page.
- The vendor strongly recommends patching all systems that have the agent installed, regardless of whether they have a global IP address or not, as local networks may also be vulnerable.
- The vendor has released a security-enhanced version with improved connection authentication to address this issue.
