  "cve": "CVE-2016-7932",
  "description": "Multiple out of bounds read and integer overflow vulnerabilities were found in tcpdump affecting the decoding of various protocols. An attacker could create a crafted pcap file or send specially crafted packets to the network segment where tcpdump is running in live capture mode (without -w) which could cause it to display incorrect data, crash or enter an infinite loop.",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "tcpdump",
    "versions": [
      "prior to 4.9.0"
    ]
  },
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow",
      "weakness": "The vulnerability lies within the pimv2_check_checksum function in print-pim.c of tcpdump.",
      "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted network packets. This can lead to a denial of service by crashing the application, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves sending specially crafted network packets to a system running tcpdump.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to inject network packets into a network segment where tcpdump is running."
