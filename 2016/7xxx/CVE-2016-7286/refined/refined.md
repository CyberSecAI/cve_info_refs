{
  "CVE-2016-7286": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability exists within the `JavascriptSIMDObject::ToLocaleString` function in `JavascriptSimdObject.cpp`. When the function is called with more than three arguments, a `newArgs` array is not properly initialized. This leads to `toLocaleString` being called on uninitialized memory, which can lead to type confusion, where integers in memory might be interpreted as pointers and vice versa.",
    "Root cause": "Improper initialization of the `newArgs` array within the `JavascriptSIMDObject::ToLocaleString` function when called with more than 3 arguments.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory usage",
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution due to memory corruption caused by calling `toLocaleString` on uninitialized memory, which can result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user. This could allow an attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted webpage can trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Microsoft Edge.",
      "Exploitation could occur through compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content and advertisements, by embedding malicious content."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage and entice the victim to visit it using Microsoft Edge. Alternatively, the attacker can inject malicious content into a compromised website or ad network."
