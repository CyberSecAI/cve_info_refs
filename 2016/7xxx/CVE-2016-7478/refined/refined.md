Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7478:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `exception::__toString` method when handling cyclic exception references during unserialization in PHP. Specifically, if an exception object's `previous` property refers back to the same exception object (or any cyclic reference), the `__toString` method enters an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The `exception::__toString` method iterates through a chain of previous exceptions. When a cyclic reference is created, this iteration becomes an infinite loop.
- **Unsafe Unserialization:** The `unserialize()` function doesn't prevent the creation of these cyclic references, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Reachable via Unserialize:** The `__toString` method can be indirectly triggered during unserialization which makes it a suitable attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop in `exception::__toString` causes the PHP process to hang indefinitely, exhausting server resources and leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation**: An attacker can provide a specially crafted serialized string to the `unserialize()` function, creating the cyclic exception reference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted serialized string to the `unserialize()` function on the target server. This can be through various means such as HTTP requests, data stored in cookies or exposed API calls
- No authentication is needed.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Proof of Concept:** The content includes a simple PHP code snippet that demonstrates the vulnerability: `unserialize('O:9:"exception":1:{S:19:"\00Exception\00previous";r:1;}');`
- **PHP 7 Impact:** In PHP 7, the `__toString` method can be called on any object during unserialization (specifically during DateInterval object processing). This further increases the attack surface as it allows more ways to trigger the `exception::__toString` method.
- **Mitigation Challenges:** The bug report indicates that preventing cyclic references is difficult, as chains of exceptions could also be problematic for the same reason.
- **NetApp Impact:** The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products using PHP were vulnerable to this flaw.

In summary, CVE-2016-7478 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in PHP caused by an infinite loop in the `exception::__toString` method when handling cyclic exception references during unserialization. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a specifically crafted serialized string to `unserialize()`.
