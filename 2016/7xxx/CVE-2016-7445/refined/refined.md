Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the `convert.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. Specifically, the issue lies in the `skip_white` function at line 1331. The root cause is that the code calls `skip_int` which returns a pointer, `s`, which is not checked for NULL before being passed again to `skip_int`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is that the code does not validate the pointer `s` returned by `skip_int` before using it in a subsequent call to `skip_int`. If `skip_int` returns a null pointer the second call will result in a dereference of a null pointer and a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the application using the OpenJPEG library. This can cause a denial of service by making the application unavailable. The CVE description notes this as a partial impact to availability.
- **Application Crash:** The vulnerability directly results in a segmentation fault and immediate termination of the affected process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted JPEG file:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG file with the `opj_compress` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a malformed image**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image to the vulnerable OpenJPEG library for processing.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in OpenJPEG versions prior to 2.1.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- A patch was released relatively quickly after the vulnerability was reported.
- The issue is located in `convert.c` at line 1331 and related to how the `skip_int` function is used in that file.
- The fix involves adding a null check for the pointer returned by `skip_int` before its subsequent use.
- The issue can crash a multi-input application, for example one that displays images in different windows
