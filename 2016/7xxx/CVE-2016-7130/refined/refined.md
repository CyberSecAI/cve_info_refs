Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-7130:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference within the `wddx_deserialize` function in PHP. Specifically, when parsing an invalid base64 binary value, the `php_base64_decode` function may return NULL, and this NULL value is then used without a proper check, leading to a dereference error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference.
- Lack of input validation before using the result of `php_base64_decode`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash of the PHP application processing the malformed WDDX packet.
- The content mentions that under certain circumstances related vulnerabilities can lead to other unspecified impacts, execute arbitrary code, or impact PHP application integrity, however this specific vulnerability is only described as resulting in a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- An attacker can craft a malicious WDDX packet with an invalid base64 binary value.
- The crafted XML document would need to be submitted to the vulnerable `wddx_deserialize` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit or inject a specially crafted XML payload that will be processed by the vulnerable PHP function.
- No specific access level is mentioned beyond the ability to send a malicious request to a server.

**Additional Details from the provided content**
- The vulnerability exists in the `ext/wddx/wddx.c` file.
- The vulnerability was addressed in PHP versions before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10.
- Red Hat also addressed the issue in `rh-php56` packages.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" security impact by Red Hat.
- The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score is 5.0 in CVSS v2 and 7.5 in CVSS v3.
