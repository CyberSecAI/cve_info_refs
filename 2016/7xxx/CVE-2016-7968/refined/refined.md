Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7968:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   KMail, starting from version 5.3.0, used a QWebEngine-based viewer with JavaScript enabled.
*   HTML mail content was not sanitized, allowing embedded JavaScript to be executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsanitized HTML mail content:** The lack of proper sanitization allowed for the inclusion of malicious JavaScript code within emails.
*   **JavaScript enabled in mail viewer:** The QWebEngine-based viewer had JavaScript enabled by default, enabling the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Message Manipulation:** An attacker could send emails with embedded JavaScript to manipulate the display of the message within KMail.
*   **Potential Further Exploitation:** Executed JavaScript could serve as an entry point for further, more complex exploits.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker could craft and send a malicious HTML email to a KMail user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to send emails:** The attacker only needs the ability to send emails to a KMail user.
*   **No authentication required:** The attack can be performed by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by disabling JavaScript in the mail viewer. This fix required Qt 5.7.0 or later.
*   Prior to Qt 5.7.0, patches were provided to partially sanitize emails, but these were not sufficient to fully prevent code injection.
*   The advisory indicates that users can mitigate this vulnerability by viewing emails in plain text.
