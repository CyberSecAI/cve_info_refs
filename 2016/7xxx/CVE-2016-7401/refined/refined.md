  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2016-7401",
    "description": "A CSRF flaw was found in Django, where an interaction between Google Analytics and Django's cookie parsing could allow an attacker to set arbitrary cookies leading to a bypass of CSRF protection. In this update, the parser for ''request.COOKIES'' has been simplified to better match browser behavior and to mitigate this attack. ''request.COOKIES'' may now contain cookies that are invalid according to RFC 6265 but are possible to set using ''document.cookie''.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in Django's cookie parsing when used with Google Analytics, which allows an attacker to set arbitrary cookies.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate cookie parsing",
         "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass CSRF protection by setting arbitrary cookies on a Django site, leading to potential unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack can be carried out remotely by manipulating cookies using an interaction between Google Analytics and the vulnerable Django application.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code that interacts with the user's browser to set arbitrary cookies."

    "remediation": "The vulnerability is resolved by simplifying the parser for request.COOKIES to better match browser behavior and adding tests to the httpwrappers and requests tests in the Django framework."
