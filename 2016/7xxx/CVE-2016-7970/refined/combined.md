# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fix blur coefficient calculation buffer overflow

```
Found by fuzzer test case id:000082,sig:11,src:002579,op:havoc,rep:8.
Correctness should be checked, but this fixes the overflow for good.

I just deducted that in the works case, we need 14 elements in that array. 13 elements should still be fine for vec\_freq, as far as I can see. Care to assist [@MrSmile](https://github.com/MrSmile)? Maybe you can document this a little further.  It kind of looks like a single iteration least squares fitting / error minimization, but like I said, I don't get it either. :)        Sorry, something went wrong.

Basically `mat_freq` and `vec_freq` used in calculation of coefficients for least squares problem and any sufficient size should work. I'd tried to determine minimal required size, but forgot that `coeff_blur121` requires additional zero element to work.        Sorry, something went wrong.     All reactions | | |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fix line wrapping mode 0/3 bugs

```
This fixes two separate bugs:

a) Don't move a linebreak into the first symbol. This results in a empty
   line at the front, which does not help to equalize line lengths at all.
b) When moving a linebreak into a symbol that already is a break, the
   number of lines must be decremented. Otherwise, uninitialized memory
   is possibly used for later layout operations.

Choose a reason  Spam Abuse Off Topic Outdated Duplicate Resolved    Hide comment      Shouldn’t this rather remove the first line (and join it with the second line) if `w` is the first glyph? Roughly like this:  ``` if (DIFF(l1_new, l2_new) < DIFF(l1, l2)) {     if (w == text_info->glyphs || w->linebreak)         text_info->n_lines--;     if (w != text_info->glyphs)         w->linebreak = 1;     s2->linebreak = 0;     exit = 0; } ```  Regarding the commit message: in addition to producing an unwanted empty line at the start, I think setting `text_info->glyphs->linebreak` also causes a [buffer overread](https://github.com/grigorig/libass/blob/b72b283b936a600c730e00875d7d067bded3fc26/libass/ass_render.c#L1473-L1477) in `trim_whitespace`—probably the cause of [#229](https://github.com/libass/libass/pull/229).
