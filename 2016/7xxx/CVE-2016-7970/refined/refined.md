{
  "CVE-2016-7970": {
    "description": "Buffer overflow in the calc_coeff function in libass/ass_blur.c in libass before 0.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `calc_coeff` function within `libass/ass_blur.c`. A buffer overflow occurs during the calculation of Gaussian blur coefficients.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is unspecified, but it's triggered via remote, likely through crafted subtitles that cause the `calc_coeff` function to write beyond the allocated buffer.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted subtitles that will be processed by the vulnerable libass library. No specific privileges are needed."
