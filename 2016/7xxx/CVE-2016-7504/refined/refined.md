{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Rp_toString` function in `jsregexp.c` of the MuJS library does not create a copy of the source pattern string of a regular expression, leading to a stale pointer when the original string is freed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to missing copy of string data.",
      "Incorrect memory management: Freeing memory while a pointer is still in use."
    ],
    "impact": "The use-after-free vulnerability can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited by a malicious attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a specific Javascript payload that triggers the `Rp_toString` function with a regular expression whose source is a string from memory that is deallocated"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code that creates a regular expression object, then uses it in a way that triggers the toString function on it. The content shows this was triggered through the eval function call."
