  "CVE-2016-7433": {
    "Description": "NTP before 4.2.8p9 does not properly perform the initial sync calculations, which allows remote attackers to unspecified impact via unknown vectors related to a \"root distance that did not include the peer dispersion.\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The fix for NTP Bug 2085 was incorrect, resulting in a root distance calculation that did not include the peer dispersion.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted spoofed packet to cause a denial of service or in some special cases even crash the service. Could also lead to time synchronization issues.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker able to send specially crafted spoofed packets."
