Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way `vprintproxy.exe` (specifically within `TPView.dll`) handles TrueType fonts embedded in EMFSPOOL files. During the processing of EMRI_ENGINE_FONT records, the code copies the contents of the CMAP table into the NAME table. A lack of bounds checking on the size of the NAME table, which is read from the font file, allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** By manipulating the NAME table size field in the font file, an attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow when copying the CMAP data into the NAME table memory location.
- **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of validation of the size of the NAME table before copying data into it. This allows the attacker to provide a larger size than the allocated memory.
- **Controlled Memory Corruption:** The attacker can control the size and to some extent the content of the memory being written past the allocated buffer, which can be used for further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can be leveraged to overwrite critical data on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the `vprintproxy.exe` process.
- **Denial of Service:** If a large enough size is specified for the NAME table, the `memset` function will trigger an access violation crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Virtual Printing:** The vulnerability is triggered through the virtual printing feature of VMware Workstation.
- **EMFSPOOL files:** The attacker must embed a malicious TrueType font within an EMFSPOOL file.
- **COM1 device:** Data sent through the virtual COM1 device within a guest OS is processed by the vulnerable `vprintproxy.exe` on the host machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest OS Access:** The attacker must be able to execute code within a guest virtual machine.
- **Virtual Printing Enabled:** The virtual printing feature must be enabled in VMware Workstation on the host.
- **COM1 Access:** The attacker within the guest must have access to the virtual COM1 serial port to send crafted data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable `TPView.DLL` version mentioned is 9.4.1045.1 (md5sum b6211e8b5c2883fa16231b0a6bf014f3).
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `vprintproxy.exe` process on the host machine.
- A proof of concept python script exists to trigger the vulnerability.

The provided information offers significant detail into the nature of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code section and how to trigger it using a crafted EMFSPOOL file. It also confirms the location and specific process that is affected.
