Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=849

As already discussed in a number of reports in this tracker (#285, #286, #287, #288, #289, #292), VMware Workstation (current version 12.1.1 build-3770994) ships with a feature called "Virtual Printers", which enables the virtualized operating systems to access printers installed on the Host. Inside the VM, the communication takes place through a COM1 device, and the incoming data is handled by a dedicated "vprintproxy.exe" process on the Host, as launched by the "vmware-vmx.exe" service. Administrative privileges are not required to access COM1 in the guest, at least on Windows.

The vprintproxy.exe is a significant attack surface for potential VM escapes. Due to its nature, the application implements support for a variety of complex protocols and file formats, such as the printing protocol, EMFSPOOL format, and further embedded EMFs, fonts, images etc. This report addresses a bug in the handling of TrueType fonts embedded in EMFSPOOL, as implemented in the TPView.DLL library extensively used by vprintproxy.exe.

The version of the TPView.DLL file referenced in this report is 9.4.1045.1 (md5sum b6211e8b5c2883fa16231b0a6bf014f3).

TrueType fonts can be embedded in EMFSPOOL files via EMRI_ENGINE_FONT records. When such a record is encountered while processing the printing request data, some complex logic is executed to load the font into the program's internal structures. For reasons which are not fully clear to me, one of the operations is to copy the contents of the CMAP table into the NAME table in memory - or, if the latter is larger than the former, create a completely new NAME table with CMAP's data. This is generally implemented in a function located at address 0x1005C230, and the high-level logic is as follows:

--- cut ---
  CMAP = FindCmapTableHeader();
  CMAP_size = ExtractSize(CMAP);
  CMAP_body = ExtractBody(CMAP);

  NAME = FindNameTableHeader();
  if (NAME) {
    NAME_size = ExtractSize(NAME);
    NAME_body = ExtractBody(NAME);

    SetTableSize(NAME, CMAP_size);

    memset(NAME_body, 0, NAME_size);

    if (CMAP_size > NAME_size) {
      SetTableOffset(NAME, font_size);

      font_data = realloc(font_size + CMAP_size);
      memset(&font_data[font_size], 0, CMAP_size);
      memcpy(&font_data[font_size], CMAP_body, CMAP_size);
    } else {
      memcpy(NAME_body, CMAP_body, CMAP_size);
    }
  }
--- cut ---

As you can see, the function doesn't perform any bounds checking of the values (offsets, sizes) loaded from table headers. Some of the fields have already been verified before and are guaranteed to be valid at this point of execution, but some of them (such as CMAP_body or NAME_size) are still fully controlled. While controlling the pointer to the CMAP section data (relative to the start of the font buffer) may be useful, being able to cheat about the NAME table size enables an attacker to cause a much more dangerous memory corruption on the heap.

For example, if we set the NAME size to an enormous value (e.g. 0xAAAAAAAA), we will encounter an immediate crash in the memset() function, as shown below:

--- cut ---
(22f0.26ac): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ThinPrint\TPView.dll -
eax=01555540 ebx=00000000 ecx=215cefc0 edx=00000026 esi=215b87d4 edi=aaaaaaaa
eip=68102056 esp=2247f298 ebp=2247f2e8 iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na po nc
cs=0023  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00010202

68102056 660f7f4140      movdqa  xmmword ptr [ecx+40h],xmm0 ds:002b:215cf000=????????????????????????????????
--- cut ---

If the NAME table size is increased by a smaller degree, such that the memset() call doesn't hit unmapped page boundary, the code may successfully finish the call and proceed to copying the contents of the CMAP section into the small NAME memory area, which would finally result in a typical heap-based buffer overflow condition with controlled length and data.

Attached is a Proof of Concept Python script, which connects to the COM1 serial port, and sends an EMFSPOOL structure containing a font file with the NAME table length set to 0xAAAAAAAA. When launched in a guest system, it should trigger the crash shown above in the vprintproxy.exe process on the host. The script is a slightly reworked version of Kostya's original exploit.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware Workstation heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation contains vulnerabilities that may allow a Windows-based Virtual Machine (VM) to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. Exploitation of these issues may lead to arbitrary code execution in VMware Workstation running on Windows.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article [2146810](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146810) documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank E0DB6391795D7F629B5077842E649393 working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue to us. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7081 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. VMware Workstation memory corruption vulnerabilities via Cortado Thinprint**

VMware Workstation contains vulnerabilities that may allow a Windows-based virtual machine (VM) to corrupt memory. This includes TrueType fonts embedded in EMFSPOOL (CVE-2016-7083), and JPEG2000 images (CVE-2016-7084) in tpview.dll. Exploitation of these issues may lead to arbitrary code execution in VMware   Workstation running on Windows.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article [2146810](https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146810) documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of Google's Project Zero for reporting these   issues to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the   identifiers CVE-2016-7083, and CVE-2016-7084 to these issues.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**c. VMware Tools NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities**

The graphic acceleration functions used in VMware Tools for OSX handle memory incorrectly. Two resulting NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities may allow for local privilege escalation on Virtual Machines that run OSX.

The issues can be remediated by installing a fixed version of VMware Tools on affected OSX   VMs directly. Alternatively the fixed version of Tools can be installed through ESXi or Fusion after first updating to a version of ESXi or Fusion that ships with a fixed version of VMware Tools.

VMware would like to thank Dr. Fabien Duchene "FuzzDragon" and Jian Zhu for independently   reporting these issues to VMware.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the   identifiers CVE-2016-7079 and CVE-2016-7080 to these issues.

**f. Workstation EMF file handling memory corruption vulnerability via Cortado ThinPrint**

VMware Workstation contains a vulnerability that may allow a Windows-based virtual machine (VM) to corrupt memory. This issue occurs due to improper handling of EMF files in tpview.dll. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code execution in the hypervisor OS. The severity of this issue has changed to Low from Critical as the    exploitation of the issue requires a custom registry value to be added on the host machine.

Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled in VMware Workstation. This feature is not enabled by default. VMware Knowledge Base article 2146810 documents the procedure for enabling and disabling this feature.

VMware would like to thank Mateusz Jurczyk of Google's Project Zero and Yakun Zhang of McAfee for individually reporting this issue to us.
