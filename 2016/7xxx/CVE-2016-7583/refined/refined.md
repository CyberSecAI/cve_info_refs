- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A dynamic library loading issue existed in the iCloud setup process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper path searching during the loading of dynamic libraries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Running the iCloud installer from an untrusted directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to place a malicious library in a location where the iCloud installer searches for dynamic libraries and then convince the user to run the installer from this untrusted location.
