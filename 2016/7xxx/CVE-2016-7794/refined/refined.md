Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `git-hub` application does not sanitize data received from the GitHub API, specifically the repository name (`reponame`). This unsanitized data is then passed directly to the `git clone` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a malicious repository name, an attacker can inject arbitrary `git` command options and potentially execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by embedding malicious commands within the repository name, which is then passed to the `git clone` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running the `git-hub` application. In the provided example, the attacker uses `git clone` with crafted arguments to execute the `cowsay` command as a proof of concept.
*  **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** In older versions of Python (before 2.7.9) that do not verify certificates by default, a MitM attacker can also exploit this vulnerability by modifying the data sent by the Github API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious GitHub Operators:** An attacker who controls a GitHub instance or has the ability to modify the API response data can inject malicious repository names when a user requests a clone.
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack (Python < 2.7.9):** A MitM attacker could modify the API response to include malicious repository names to execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs control over the GitHub API response. This could be achieved by:
    *   Being a malicious operator of the GitHub server.
    *   Conducting a man-in-the-middle attack (particularly relevant for Python versions before 2.7.9).
*  The attacker would need knowledge about how the git-hub application handles the data returned from the Github API.

**Technical Details**

* The exploit uses the `--config` option of `git clone` to inject a `core.gitProxy` configuration setting, which in the example executes `perl`. The `git://` url then contains a perl command to execute `cowsay pwned > /dev/tty`.
* The vulnerability is present because `git-hub` does not sanitize data it receives from Github API before passing to the `git` command.
