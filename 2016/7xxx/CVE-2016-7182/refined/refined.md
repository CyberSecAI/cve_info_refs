Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows Graphics Component. Specifically, it occurs during the parsing of TrueType fonts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** The core weakness is the ability for an attacker to elevate their privileges from user mode to kernel mode due to the improper memory handling in the Graphics Component when parsing TrueType fonts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution in Kernel Mode:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel.
- **Full System Control:** Once in kernel mode, an attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights, gaining complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The provided content does not explicitly state the specific attack vector for this vulnerability, but it is often associated with:
    - **Web-based Attacks**: An attacker could host a malicious website or inject a crafted font into a legitimate website that exploits this vulnerability.
    - **File Sharing**: An attacker could embed a malicious font within a document (like a Word file, PDF, or email attachment) that, when opened, could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to either visit a malicious website, open a malicious document or view a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path in the Windows Graphics Component, specifically during font parsing.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Microsoft Graphics Component handles objects in memory during font parsing.
- The provided document also references other vulnerabilities addressed by the same security bulletin MS16-120, including GDI+ Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-3393 and CVE-2016-3396) and other information disclosure and elevation of privilege vulnerabilities related to graphics.
