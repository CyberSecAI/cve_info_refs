Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7424:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `put_no_rnd_pixels8_xy2_mmx` function within the `rnd_template.c` file of the libav library.
- The issue was initially reported as an invalid memory access/out-of-bounds read, but was corrected to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A null pointer dereference exists within the `put_no_rnd_pixels8_xy2_mmx` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination due to the null pointer dereference. This can cause a denial-of-service.
- The program crashes and aborts, preventing further processing of the input file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted media file (specifically, an MP3 file was used in the discovery).
- The issue arises during video decoding, specifically the h263 codec.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file that will trigger the vulnerable code path in libav.
- The attacker can be in a position to provide input to a system that processes media files with libav.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- A patch was created to address the issue.
- The affected version is libav 11.7.
- The vulnerability is present in the x86 architecture-specific code.

**Summary:**
CVE-2016-7424 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability within the libav library that can be triggered by providing a crafted media file. Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service due to program crashes. The vulnerability was fixed with a patch.
