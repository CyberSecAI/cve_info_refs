**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to submit a request that could lead to the creation of an admin account in the application. This means an attacker could gain full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to be an authenticated user.
- User interaction is required (UI:R) for the attack to succeed. The user must be tricked into executing a malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GLPI application.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim (another authenticated user) into initiating a malicious request, likely through a social engineering tactic like a link or an embedded image that automatically triggers the request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected version of GLPI is 0.90.4.
- The issue was reported and is tracked in GitHub issue #2483.
- It is reported that the vulnerability was fixed by commit `fc93633` in the GLPI project.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.0, rated as High severity.
- The EPSS score is 0.101%, indicating a relatively low probability of exploitation in the next 30 days.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-352, which is specific to CSRF vulnerabilities.
