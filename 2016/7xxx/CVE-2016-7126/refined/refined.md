  "CVE-2016-7126": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Type mismatch between ncolors (64-bit integer) and colorsWanted (32-bit integer) parameters in `zif_imagetruecolortopalette` and `php_gd_gdImageTrueColorToPalette`.  A large value for ncolors is cast to a smaller integer, resulting in an insufficient memory allocation by `select_colors`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient memory allocation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash) due to heap-buffer-overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a large value in the third argument to the `imagetruecolortopalette` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to control the arguments passed to the vulnerable `imagetruecolortopalette` function."
  },
  "CVE-2016-7127": {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `imagegammacorrect` function in PHP allows gamma values with different signs.  This can lead to palette colors being assigned values greater than 0xFF.  Later, these out-of-range values are used in a calculation using the `gdTrueColorAlpha` macro, which can result in a negative index that allows an arbitrary null write.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary write due to usage of negative index.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary null write, leading to a crash or possibly other impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "By calling `imagegammacorrect` with two gamma values that have different signs, after creating a truecolor image and converting it to a palette.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to control the gamma values passed to the `imagegammacorrect` function."
  },
  "CVE-2016-7418": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An incorrect boolean element in a WDDX packet can cause an out-of-bounds read in the php_wddx_push_element function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read and invalid pointer access.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash) or possibly other unspecified impact.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted WDDX packet containing an incorrect boolean element to the `wddx_deserialize` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted wddx packet."
