{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default sudo configuration preserved the value of INPUTRC from the user's environment, which could lead to information disclosure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information Disclosure",
    "A local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files with elevated privileges provided by sudo."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files with elevated privileges provided by sudo.  It is also possible to cause segmentation fault through stack exhaustion in the target application by having INPUTRC specify a file with an $include directive for itself.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local user with sudo access can manipulate the INPUTRC environment variable to specify a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with sudo access to a program that uses readline."
