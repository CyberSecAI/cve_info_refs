Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver (specifically, `win32k.sys`) failing to properly handle objects in memory. This improper handling allows for a memory corruption which can be leveraged to gain elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory object handling in `win32k.sys`.
- Potential for memory corruption.
- Elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
- Run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Install programs.
- View, change, or delete data.
- Create new accounts with full user rights.
- Ultimately take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to log on to the system locally.
- The attacker then executes a specially crafted application designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a valid user account on the target system, or a way to gain a local logon.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important."
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows.
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2016-7259, which is another elevation of privilege vulnerability related to the Windows graphics component improperly handling objects in memory.
