| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1404782#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-14 15:59:52 UTC  ``` Undertow keeps a cache of seen HTTP headers in persistent connections. It was found that this cache can easily exploited to fill memory with garbage, up to "max-headers" (default 200) * "max-header-size" (default 1MB) per active TCP connection.

# RHSA-2017:3456 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1.0 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.0.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* A Denial of Service can be caused when a long request is sent to EAP 7. (CVE-2016-7046)
* World executable permission on bin/jboss-cli after installation. Any users of the system could cause harm, or shutdown the running instance. (CVE-2016-7066)
* A deserialization vulnerability via readValue method of ObjectMapper which allows arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2017-7525)
* JMSObjectMessage deserializes potentially malicious objects allowing Remote Code Execution. (CVE-2016-4978)
* Undertow is vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary HTTP headers, and also response splitting. (CVE-2016-4993)
* The domain controller will not propagate its administrative RBAC configuration to some slaves leading to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-5406)
* Internal IP address disclosed on redirect when request header Host field is not set. (CVE-2016-6311)
* Potential EAP resource starvation DOS attack via GET requests for server log files. (CVE-2016-8627)
* Inefficient Header Cache could cause denial of service. (CVE-2016-9589)
* The log file viewer allows arbitrary file read to authenticated user via path traversal. (CVE-2017-2595)
* HTTP Request smuggling vulnerability due to permitting invalid characters in HTTP requests. (CVE-2017-2666)
* Websocket non clean close can cause IO thread to get stuck in a loop. (CVE-2017-2670)
* Privilege escalation with security manager's reflective permissions when granted to Hibernate Validator. (CVE-2017-7536)
* Potential http request smuggling as Undertow parses the http headers with unusual whitespaces. (CVE-2017-7559)
* Properties based files of the management and the application realm are world readable allowing access to users and roles information to all the users logged in to the system. (CVE-2017-12167)
* RBAC configuration allows users with a Monitor role to view the sensitive information. (CVE-2016-7061)
* Improper whitespace parsing leading to potential HTTP request smuggling. (CVE-2017-12165)
