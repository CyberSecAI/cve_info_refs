- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DokuWiki application uses the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable to construct password reset URLs. This variable is populated by the HTTP Host header from the client's request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application is vulnerable to Host header injection. An attacker can manipulate the Host header in an HTTP request, causing DokuWiki to generate password reset links with a malicious domain.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to phishing attacks, where users receive password reset links pointing to a malicious site controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to potentially steal user credentials when they attempt to reset their passwords through the crafted URL.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can modify the Host header of an HTTP request to the DokuWiki server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the DokuWiki server and modify the `Host` header. This does not require any special privileges or access within the application. The attacker must be able to reach the DokuWiki server over the network.
