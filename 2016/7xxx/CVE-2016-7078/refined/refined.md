Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-7078:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content directly references CVE-2016-7078 and includes descriptions, discussions, and links related to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is consistently described across multiple sources as an authorization bypass issue where users without assigned organizations or locations can view all resources.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insufficient access control mechanism in Foreman. When a user is not explicitly associated with any organization or location, the system fails to restrict their view to a specific context, defaulting instead to showing all resources. The system did not handle the lack of an organization/location association properly during permission checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** Users with no assigned organizations or locations were unintentionally granted access to view resources across all organizations and locations.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Users could potentially view resources they were not authorized to access based on their intended context.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could gain unauthorized insight into resources managed by the Foreman instance, regardless of their assigned organizations or locations.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web UI:**  A user could log in through the web interface and view all resources instead of none.
*   **API:** The API exposed the same vulnerability, allowing access to all resources.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** An attacker needed a valid user account in the Foreman instance.
*   **No Organization/Location Assignment:** The attacker's user account had to have no assigned organization or location.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Foreman:** Familiarity with the Foreman UI or API was required to navigate and view unauthorized data.

**Additional Details from Content:**
