Use CVE-2016-7116 for the issue fixed by the
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=56f101ecce0eafd09e2daf1c4eeb1377d6959261>
commit.

We feel that it is possible that there are related issues that are
also vulnerabilities.

<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fff39a7ad09da07ef490de05c92c91f22f8002f2>
mentions "Empty path components don't make sense for most commands and
may cause undefined behavior, depending on the backend." The patch
blocks these empty strings. Would it be best to consider this a
vulnerability fix (i.e., because the undefined behavior might be
security-relevant)?

<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fff39a7ad09da07ef490de05c92c91f22f8002f2>
also makes a change to forbid '/' characters, with the rationale that
the specification requires clients to send individual path components,
not full path strings or substrings containing a '/' character. Does
this also fix a vulnerability?

<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=805b5d98c649d26fc44d2d7755a97f18e62b438a>
prevents creating files named "." and ".." (just those two specific
filenames, not all pathnames containing those characters). Does this
also fix a vulnerability?

It is possible that up to three additional CVE IDs are needed.

Finally, if fixing the directory traversal itself requires both
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=56f101ecce0eafd09e2daf1c4eeb1377d6959261>
and
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fff39a7ad09da07ef490de05c92c91f22f8002f2>
(for '/' characters), please let us know.

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH v2 0/5] 9P security fixes

```
As reported by Felix Wilhelm, at various places in 9pfs, full paths are
created by concatenating a guest originated string to the export path. A
malicious guest could forge a relative path and access files outside the
export path.

A tentative fix was sent recently by Prasad J Pandit, but it was only
focused on the local backend and did not get a positive review. This series
tries to address the issue more globally, based on the official 9P spec.

This v2 is actually a complete rework of my previous post, based on the
feedback I had from Peter Maydell:

<http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/662324/>

Note that xattrwalk and xattrcreate are no longer part of the pictures
since they are being passed attribute names, not file names actually.

The official linux client only sends 1 path component at a time, without
any / nor NULs nor "." nor ".." and we don't have a functional qtest yet
for 9P, so I had to do limited manual testing using GDB to hack strings
coming from a linux client. It is no longer possible to access files
outside the export path if this series is applied.

I could also run the POSIX file system test suite from TUXERA:

<http://www.tuxera.com/community/open-source-posix/>

and did not observe any regression with this patch (at least with
the local backend and the none/passthrough/mapped security models).

Patch 5/5 isn't related to the initial path traversal issue but I found it
while working on empty strings, so I send it along anyway.

Subject: CVE request: Qemu: 9p: directory traversal flaw in 9p virtio
 backend

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to a directory/path traversal issue.
It could occur while creating or accessing files on a shared host directory.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access undue files on
the host.

Upstream patches:
-----------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-08/msg03917.html>

Reference:
----------
   -> <http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup>

This flaw was reported by Mr Felix Wilhelm.

Thank you.

Several vulnerabilities were found in QEMU, a fast processor emulator:

CVE-2016-2391

    Zuozhi Fzz discovered that eof_times in USB OHCI emulation support
    could be used to cause a denial of service, via a null pointer
    dereference.

CVE-2016-2392 / CVE-2016-2538

    Qinghao Tang found a NULL pointer dereference and multiple integer
    overflows in the USB Net device support that could allow local guest
    OS administrators to cause a denial of service. These issues related
    to remote NDIS control message handling.

CVE-2016-2841

    Yang Hongke reported an infinite loop vulnerability in the NE2000 NIC
    emulation support.

CVE-2016-2857

    Liu Ling found a flaw in QEMU IP checksum routines. Attackers could
    take advantage of this issue to cause QEMU to crash.

CVE-2016-2858

    Arbitrary stack based allocation in the Pseudo Random Number Generator
    (PRNG) back-end support.

CVE-2016-4001 / CVE-2016-4002

    Oleksandr Bazhaniuk reported buffer overflows in the Stellaris and the
    MIPSnet ethernet controllers emulation. Remote malicious users could
    use these issues to cause QEMU to crash.

CVE-2016-4020

    Donghai Zdh reported that QEMU incorrectly handled the access to the
    Task Priority Register (TPR), allowing local guest OS administrators
    to obtain sensitive information from host stack memory.

CVE-2016-4037

    Du Shaobo found an infinite loop vulnerability in the USB EHCI
    emulation support.

CVE-2016-4439 / CVE-2016-4441 / CVE-2016-5238 / CVE-2016-5338 / CVE-2016-6351

    Li Qiang found different issues in the QEMU 53C9X Fast SCSI Controller
    (FSC) emulation support, that made it possible for local guest OS
    privileged users to cause denials of service or potentially execute
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-4453 / CVE-2016-4454

    Li Qiang reported issues in the QEMU VMWare VGA module handling, that
    may be used to cause QEMU to crash, or to obtain host sensitive
    information.

CVE-2016-4952 / CVE-2016-7421 / CVE-2016-7156

    Li Qiang reported flaws in the VMware paravirtual SCSI bus emulation
    support. These issues concern an out-of-bounds access and infinite
    loops, that allowed local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2016-5105 / CVE-2016-5106 / CVE-2016-5107 / CVE-2016-5337

    Li Qiang discovered several issues in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host
    Bus Adapter emulation support. These issues include stack information
    leakage while reading configuration and out-of-bounds write and read.

CVE-2016-6834

    Li Qiang reported an infinite loop vulnerability during packet
    fragmentation in the network transport abstraction layer support.
    Local guest OS privileged users could made use of this flaw to cause a

```
As reported by Felix Wilhelm, at various places in 9pfs, full paths are
created by concatenating a guest originated string to the export path. A
malicious guest could forge a relative path and access files outside the
export path.

A tentative fix was sent recently by Prasad J Pandit, but it was only
focused on the local backend and did not get a positive review. This series
tries to address the issue more globally, based on the official 9P spec.

I wasn't running the TUXERA test suite correctly and overlooked a failure
with symbolic links (thanks Aneesh for your assistance). This v4 is basically
the same as v3 with a change in patch 1/3.

# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201609-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.0-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.0-r3** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users within a guest QEMU environment can execute arbitrary code
within the host or a cause a Denial of Service condition of the QEMU
guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.7.0-r3"

```
