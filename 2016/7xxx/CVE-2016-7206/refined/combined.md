## Cumulative Security Update for Microsoft Edge (3204062)

Published: December 13, 2016

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by:

* Microsoft browser and affected components handle objects in memory
* Microsoft browser checks Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers
* Scripting engines handle objects in memory

For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3204062](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3204062).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when affected Microsoft browsers improperly access objects in memory. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerabilities through affected Microsoft browsers, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how Microsoft browsers handles objects in memory.

The following table contains a link to the standard entry for the vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Edge Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7181](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7181) | No | No |
| Microsoft Browser Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7279](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7279) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

Information disclosure vulnerabilities exist when Microsoft Browsers do not properly validate content under specific conditions. An attacker who exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code that could lead to an information disclosure.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Browsers validate content.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Edge Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7206](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7206) | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Edge Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7280](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7280) | No | No |
| Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability | [CVE-2016-7282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-7282) | Yes | No |

## Multiple Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through a Microsoft browser and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected Microsoft scripting engines handle objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Microsoft Browser Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2016-7281

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when the Microsoft browsers fail to correctly apply Same Origin Policy for scripts running inside Web Workers.

An attacker could trick a user into loading a page with malicious content. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to trick a user into loading a page or visiting a site. The page could also be injected into a compromised site or ad network.

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the Same Origin Policy check for scripts running inside Web Workers.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for the vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list.
