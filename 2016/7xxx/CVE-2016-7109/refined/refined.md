Based on the provided document, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-7109 and CVE-2016-7110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation on special fields within the Huawei Unified Maintenance Audit (UMA) system. This allows an attacker to inject special characters into these fields, modifying them to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is command injection. The system does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied inputs before using them in system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Obtaining sensitive information from the device.
- Modifying device data.
- Causing unavailability of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker needs network access to the affected UMA device.
- Input Modification: The attacker injects special characters to manipulate specific fields in the system, ultimately causing the execution of injected commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be connected to the device via the network.
- Knowledge of injectable fields: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable fields within the UMA system where special characters can be injected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions two related vulnerabilities, identified as HWPSIRT-2016-07047 and HWPSIRT-2016-07048, which are assigned CVE-2016-7109 and CVE-2016-7110 respectively. Both share the same root cause and impact.
- The vulnerabilities were disclosed by the Third Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security.
- Patches have been released to address these vulnerabilities.
- The advisory provides CVSS v2 scores for each vulnerability, indicating a critical severity (Base Score: 10.0).
- The affected versions are UMA versions earlier than V200R001C00SPC200. The fixed version is V200R001C00SPC200.
