# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2017-01 for dnsdist: Crafted backend responses can cause a denial of service[Â¶](#powerdns-security-advisory-2017-01-for-dnsdist-crafted-backend-responses-can-cause-a-denial-of-service "Permalink to this headline")

* CVE: CVE-2016-7069
* Date: 2017-08-21
* Credit: Guido Vranken
* Affects: dnsdist up to and including 1.2.0 on 32-bit systems
* Not affected: dnsdist 1.2.0, dnsdist on 64-bit (all versions)
* Severity: Low
* Impact: Degraded service or Denial of service
* Exploit: This issue can be triggered by sending specially crafted response packets from a backend
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version
* Workaround: Disable EDNS Client Subnet addition

An issue has been found in dnsdist in the way EDNS0 OPT records are handled when parsing responses from a backend. When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.

dnsdist up to and including 1.1.0 is affected on 32-bit systems. dnsdist 1.2.0 is not affected, dnsdist on 64-bit systems is not affected.

For those unable to upgrade to a new version, a minimal patch is [available for 1.1.0](https://downloads.powerdns.com/patches/2017-01)

We would like to thank Guido Vranken for finding and subsequently reporting this issue.
