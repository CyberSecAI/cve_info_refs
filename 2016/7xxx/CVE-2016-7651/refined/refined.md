Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7651:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue where authorization settings were not properly reset when an application was uninstalled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or reset authorization settings upon application removal. This can lead to leftover authorization data remaining on the device, potentially causing security or privacy issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is that uninstalling an app did not reset its authorization settings. This could potentially lead to unintended access or privileges being retained after the app is no longer present on the device. The exact nature and severity of this depends on the type of authorization settings involved, which is not clearly defined in the provided information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a normal app uninstall. The vulnerability is triggered by the system's failure to correctly handle the authorization data when an app is removed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not necessarily need special capabilities or positions. The vulnerability is triggered by a standard user action (app uninstall). The user is essentially the attacker, although they may not be aware they're exploiting a security issue.
