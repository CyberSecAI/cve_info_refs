  "CVE-2016-10176": {
    "Description": "This security advisory addresses the following CVE vulnerabilities: CVE-2016-10174, CVE-2016-10175, and CVE-2016-10176. NETGEAR is aware of the security vulnerability that can in very limited instances allow remote access to a router or modem router, including password recovery and command execution. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker has access to the internal network or when a user has turned on remote management on the router or modem router.",
    "Root cause": "Improper access control vulnerability in the apply_noauth.cgi script allows unauthenticated users to perform sensitive actions, including rebooting the router, changing settings, and retrieving the administrative password by exploiting a timestamp generation flaw.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control",
      "Stack Buffer Overflow",
       "Information Leakage",
       "Predictable Timestamp Generation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with root privileges, disclosure of admin credentials, and unauthorized modification of device settings.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of apply_noauth.cgi without authentication using a predictable timestamp.",
       "Stack buffer overflow in the handling of the hidden_lang_avi parameter.",
      "LAN or WAN access if remote management is enabled."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same local network or have access through the WAN if remote management is enabled. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. In order to use the stack buffer overflow, the attacker needs to be able to send POST requests."
