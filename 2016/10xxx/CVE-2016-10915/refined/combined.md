### [Does its job, RIP free version](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-its-job-rip-free-version/)

[SFAT LLC](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sfatllc/ "Posts by SFAT LLC")

UX and UI are clunky since the plugin inception and can be overwhelming for casuals. Recent changes to Pro plan, that moved any gallery’s core functionality – which in my opinion is lightbox – to the paid plan basically killed its free version usefulness. Nonetheless, as a Pro product does its jobs, offers lifetime plan for decent money, which is very rare nowadays, has tons of options and effects. A lot can be achieved with it, without touching single line of CSS.
