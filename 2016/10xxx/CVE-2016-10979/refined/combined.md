Don’t work. I can’t register, I can’t have a username or API.

This is not free.
You are required to register at www.textcavate.com. They have several plans to choose from starting at $.99 a month. The next plan up is $19.99 a month. I was looking for a free alternative to premium plugins that already do what this one does. This isn’t that option, and Text Cavate has had several issues registering my free account before I knew they were a paid service.
The technical issues with Text Cavate, and the lack of transparency about this being a paid plugin gives me pause in dealing with them.

it’s free to register for an account but you have to pay to get the tags, why don’t you say that upfront instead of wasting my time installing the plugin and registering, seriously!!! i have better things to do
