- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when creating a new monitor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed by the victim's browser when they view the crafted content. This could lead to various attacks including session hijacking, defacement, and phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via the "name" field when creating a new monitor. An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the functionality for creating new monitors. This may require authentication to access the vulnerable function.
