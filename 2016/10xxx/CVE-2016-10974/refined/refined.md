Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2016-10974 Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The `frs_save()` AJAX handler in the "Fluid Responsive Slideshow" WordPress plugin lacked CSRF token validation (nonce check). It also failed to validate the post type before modifying database entries. Additionally, there was a reflected XSS vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The absence of `check_admin_referer()` or `verify_nonce()` allows an attacker to make authenticated AJAX requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
    *   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Due to the lack of post type validation, the vulnerable function could be maliciously used to modify any entry in the `wp_posts` table. This allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to stored XSS.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** A separate reflected XSS vulnerability existed via the `skin` parameter in the URL.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could modify content on the site, inject malicious scripts, and potentially redirect users to attacker-controlled content.
    *   In an administrator context, exploitation could lead to server-side compromise, potentially giving the attacker complete control of the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** Requires a logged-in WordPress user to view attacker-controlled HTML content, which then triggers the malicious AJAX requests.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Achieved by leveraging the CSRF vulnerability to inject JavaScript into the `wp_posts` table. The attacker then redirects the victim to view the modified content.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Achieved by tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For CSRF and stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to make a logged-in WordPress user visit a webpage under their control.
    *   For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a URL with the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerable plugin was closed on June 28, 2019 due to security issues.
* The plugin was patched on May 18, 2016 in version 2.2.7.
* The reflected XSS is stopped by the Chrome XSS Auditor.
