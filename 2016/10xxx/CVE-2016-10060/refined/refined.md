Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10060:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of the `fputc` function within the `ConcatenateImages` function in `MagickWand/magick-cli.c`. Specifically, the code attempts to write characters to an output file using `fputc`, but it does not verify if the write operation was successful, potentially leading to errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unchecked Return Value:** The primary weakness is the failure to check the return value of `fputc`. If `fputc` fails (e.g., due to disk space issues, write permissions, or other file system problems), it returns `EOF`, however this isn't checked and the program continues.
- **Potential for Crash:** If writing to the output file fails, the program may continue to execute without knowing that the write operation has failed and may lead to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted input file could trigger the unchecked write error, leading to a program crash and causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted File:** A user could supply a maliciously crafted file as input to the ImageMagick program. The program attempts to process this file and writes to a output file. When this file operation fails, the program may crash.
- **Command Line Utility:** The vulnerable code exists within the command-line utility of ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to ImageMagick for processing and trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was addressed in commit `933e96f01a8c889c7bf5ffd30020e86a02a046e7` by adding a check for `fputc` return value.
- The fix ensures that the program will detect if the write operation fails and set the `status` to `MagickFalse`.
- A related issue with `fwrite` in `ReadGROUP4Image` was assigned CVE-2016-10062.
