The provided content describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Amanda 3.3.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `runtar` setuid root binary in Amanda 3.3.1 does not properly sanitize user-supplied arguments after the `--create` option.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability: The vulnerability allows a user with `backup` privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the `runtar` execution as root.
- Improper input sanitization: The `runtar` binary does not validate or sanitize arguments provided after `--create`, allowing for command manipulation.
- Setuid binary: The `runtar` binary has the setuid bit set, causing it to run as root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: A user with `backup` privileges can execute arbitrary commands as root.
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system and have user level access to the `backup` group.
- Exploitation of the `runtar` binary: The attacker must be able to execute the `runtar` binary with malicious command injections.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User with `backup` privileges on the local system.
- Ability to execute the `runtar` binary.
