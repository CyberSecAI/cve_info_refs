Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10987

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `ps_sms_numbers` parameter within the Persian WooCommerce SMS plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the `ps_sms_numbers` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful XSS attack could enable the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they visit a page with the crafted exploit. This can lead to:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
  - **Defacement:** Modifying the visual presentation of the webpage.
  - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.
  - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data visible within the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `ps_sms_numbers` parameter. When a user visits this URL, the unsanitized parameter is reflected back into the page, causing the malicious script to be executed by the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to click or otherwise access the malicious URL. This could involve:
  - **Social Engineering:** Tricking the victim into clicking a link through emails or other messaging channels.
  - **Website Injection:** Embedding the malicious link into another website that the victim is likely to visit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `testfiles/persian-woocommerce-sms/lib/class.bulk.send.php` at line 45.
- The vulnerability was reported for version 3.3.2 of the plugin and was fixed in version 3.3.4.
- The provided information includes a timeline of vulnerability disclosure, indicating that the vulnerability was initially reported to the vendor and later to WordPress, followed by a full disclosure due to lack of timely response.
