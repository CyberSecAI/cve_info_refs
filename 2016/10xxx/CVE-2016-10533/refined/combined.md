## Description

[![@smirea](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544097?u=3aafe1c20b110e67925b4bd07fe6f74c64fcf016&v=4&size=48)](/smirea)[smirea](https://github.com/smirea)opened [on Feb 13, 2016](https://github.com/florianholzapfel/express-restify-mongoose/issues/252#issue-133414965)

say you have an `User` model:

```
const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    password: String,
}));
```

normally you want to never expose the password, under any circumstances, so you'd normally do:

```
restify.serve(router, User, {
    private: ['password'],
})
```

Now this works with hitting any endpoint:

`GET /User` does not show the fields

`GET /User/some-id` also does not show the password

**HOWEVER:**

`GET /User?distinct=password` shows ALL passwords for ALL users in the database ...

This is a huge security concern
