{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when accessing files through media sources. Specifically, the `browser/directory/getlist`, `browser/directory/remove`, and `browser/directory/getfiles` processors failed to properly handle specially crafted requests containing `../`, allowing traversal outside of the intended media source base path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Path Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a valid manager session and access to a media source could exploit this vulnerability to read and potentially manipulate files outside of the intended media source path. This could lead to information disclosure or manipulation of sensitive files on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted requests with path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) to the vulnerable processors through the manager interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid manager session and access to a media source within the MODX system."
