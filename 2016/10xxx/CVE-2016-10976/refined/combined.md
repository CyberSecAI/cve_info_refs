2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

```

## FAQ

1. I installed the Safe Editor, where can I edit the css & javascript?

   * The Safe Editor settings panel is located under Tools/Safe Editor in your WordPress admin panel.
2. The javascript I write in the editor is not being executed. Why?

   * Make sure you have the wp\_footer() hook in your footer.php file (in your theme).
3. I’m geting the ‘$ is not defined’ error on frontend when I use the javascript editor.

   * If you are writing jQuery in the javascript editor make sure you wrap it in ‘jQuery(document).ready(function( $ ) { YOURCODE });”
