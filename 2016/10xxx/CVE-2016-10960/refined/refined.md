Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `wsecure-config.php` file in the wSecure Lite plugin allowing direct access to its settings page, which should only be available to administrator-level users. Additionally, the plugin uses unsanitized user-controlled input to write arbitrary code to the `params.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `wsecure-config.php` file, which handles plugin settings, can be accessed directly without proper authorization checks. This allows unauthorized users (including those with Contributor-level access and above in the admin area) to modify plugin settings.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The plugin's code allows arbitrary code to be written to the `/wp-content/plugins/wsecure/params.php` file. Specifically, user-supplied data from the POST request is directly included in a string which is written to a file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize the input received through POST requests, specifically the `publish`, `passkeytype`, `key`, `options`, and `custom_path` parameters before writing them to the `params.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete Takeover:** By injecting arbitrary PHP code into the `params.php` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows them to take complete control of the website, including modifying files, databases, and potentially the server itself.
*   **Disable Security:** An attacker could easily disable the security measures implemented by the plugin itself, making the website more vulnerable.
*   **Data Breaches:** Attackers could also use the vulnerability to steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wsecure-config.php` file.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The configuration page is accessible without requiring administrator level privileges, making it easily exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress website to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit involves crafting a POST request to the `wsecure-config.php` with the `wsecure_action` parameter set to "update" and malicious code injected into the `publish` field. The injected code will be written into `/wp-content/plugins/wsecure/params.php` file.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided in the content to demonstrate how an attacker can inject PHP code into the `params.php` file.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.
*  The plugin was closed on August 17, 2023 due to security issues.
