With the latest version of the plugin my `mode: 'try'` routes exhibit this behaviour.

This did not happen previously.

### @nelsonic **[nelsonic](/nelsonic)** commented [Oct 15, 2015](#issue-111649351)

Adds regression test for `try` and `optional` auth modes.

see: [#111](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/111)

Without the lines:

```
if (!token && request.auth.mode !== 'required') {
   return reply.continue({ credentials: {} });
}
```

it *actually* works *exactly* as expected.

Confirmed by the *master* in: [hapijs/hapi#2843](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2843)

[@alanshaw](https://github.com/alanshaw) I took the regression tests directly from your branch: [alanshaw@736067f](https://github.com/alanshaw/hapi-auth-jwt2/commit/736067f8f73bf7388438e399e12050489b9a400c)

please `checkout` this branch and confirm it works as expected.

Thanks. 👍
