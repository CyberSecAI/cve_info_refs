- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Post Indexer plugin makes an unencrypted HTTP request to `premium.wpmudev.org`, and the response is passed to PHP's `unserialize()` function. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker, or the server itself, to return a malicious serialized object that can execute arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe usage of `unserialize()` on data obtained over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, which could lead to complete compromise of the affected WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks on the network connection between the affected site and `premium.wpmudev.org` or a compromised `premium.wpmudev.org` server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to intercept or manipulate the HTTP traffic between the WordPress site and `premium.wpmudev.org` or have control over `premium.wpmudev.org` server itself.
