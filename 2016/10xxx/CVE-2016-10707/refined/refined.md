Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10707:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the removal of logic that lowercased attribute names in jQuery. This change caused an infinite recursion when attribute getters were used with mixed-case names for boolean attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Infinite Recursion:** The core weakness is the lack of proper handling of mixed-case attribute names when retrieving boolean attributes, leading to infinite recursion.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The recursion exceeds the stack call limit, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service, rendering the affected application or service unavailable due to the crash caused by stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted Input:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing HTML elements with mixed-case attribute names, which are then processed by the vulnerable jQuery code. For example, using `$('<div>').attr('requiRed')`.
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any privileges or special access to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely, by sending requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in jQuery versions >=3.0.0-rc1 and <3.0.0
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that attribute hooks are determined for the lowercase versions of the names, also for boolean attributes.
- A test case was added to verify that mixed-case attributes are handled correctly.
