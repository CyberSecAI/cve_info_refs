### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a published code exploit for this vulnerability.

MatureEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 28 May 2016

[CVE-2016-10707  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-10707) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `jquery` to version 3.0.0 or higher.

## Overview

[jquery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) is a package that makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)
due to removing a logic that lowercased attribute names. Any attribute getter using a mixed-cased name for boolean attributes goes into an infinite recursion, exceeding the stack call limit.

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, npm `ws` package

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

3.7 low

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

## Description

[![@mgol](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1758366?u=b8bbaee0cb1861098456b83b8674e0a6897fc9f3&v=4&size=48)](/mgol)[mgol](https://github.com/mgol)opened [on May 29, 2016](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3133#issue-157400482)
### Description

In [#2916](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2916) we removed our logic that lowercased attribute names. This caused one regression: any attribute getter using a name for boolean attributes but not all lowercased is going into an infinite recursion, exceeding the stack call limit.

Amongst others, this is breaking the AngularJS test suite when tested with jQuery 3.0.0-rc1.

### Link to test case

<https://jsfiddle.net/shnann6y/2/>

Basically, `$('<div>').attr('requiRed')` is enough to trigger the error.

### Summary

Attribute hooks are determined for the lowercase versions of attribute names

but this has not been reflected in the bool attribute hooks. The code that

temporarily removed a handler to avoid an infinite loop was removing an

incorrect handler causing stack overflow.

Should this be a test that mixed-case attributes are correctly retrieved? This just ensures they don't throw but not that they yield correct results.

You're right, I'll change that.

What do you think about the `try-catch` approach? Or should I just check assertions and rely on QUnit to fail when it throws? I thought the `try-catch` approach is better here where I'm specifically testing that no error is thrown.

| PR updated. I added another commit that fixes an older test that was introducing side effects, in turn causing the test I've just added to fail only on even runs. 😄 |

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
