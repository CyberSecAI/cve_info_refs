{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of an offset within the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format when handling bitmap data. A crafted EMF file could specify an invalid offset that, when used, leads to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the LibreOffice process, or a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted EMF file using LibreOffice.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted EMF file. The user must open this file using a vulnerable version of LibreOffice."
  },
  "affected_products": [
      "LibreOffice versions prior to 5.2.5 and 5.3.0",
      "app-office/libreoffice versions prior to 5.2.7.2",
