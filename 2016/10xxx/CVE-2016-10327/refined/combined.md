**LibreOffice is a privacy-oriented office suite that runs on your own computer and doesn‚Äôt include AI features out-of-the-box. But we know that many users are interested in combining AI tools with the suite, so we talked to John Balis who is working on a (fully optional!) LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here‚Äôs what he had to say‚Ä¶**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc‚Äôs chart topic ‚Äì in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.‚Ä¶

**Marcial Machado recently [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/1hf4sqo/i_made_an_impress_template_in_native_opt_to_play/) about his ‚Äúfully-featured LibreOffice Impress template for creating Jeopardy-style games. Just add your questions and categories, and you‚Äôre good to go!‚Äù So let‚Äôs find out more‚Ä¶**

### What does the template do?

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.‚Ä¶

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinn√É¬ºtzige rechtsf√É¬§hige Stiftung des b√É¬ºrgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world‚Äôs leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinn√É¬ºtzige rechtsf√É¬§hige Stiftung des b√É¬ºrgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world‚Äôs leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

### Donate

LibreOffice is made possible by the efforts of thousands of volunteers around the globe, and by the generosity of donors. [Please support our efforts: your donation helps us to deliver a better product!](https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/)

### Become a TDF Member

If you are one of the volunteers contributing to the LibreOffice or Document Liberation projects, you should consider the opportunity of becoming a [member](/members/) of The Document Foundation, by filling the [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### The Bodies of the Foundation

The formal bodies of the Foundation are:

* The [Board of Directors](/board/) (or ‚ÄúBoD‚Äù). The Foundation‚Äôs Board of Directors is the main administration of the Foundation‚Äôs projects and teams. Board members are the foundation‚Äôs judicial and extrajudicial representatives.
* The [Membership Committee](/mc/) (or ‚ÄúMC‚Äù). Mission of the MC is to administer membership applications and renewals and to oversee election of the BoD.
* The [Board of Trustees](/members/) (or ‚ÄúMembers‚Äù). The Board of Trustees consists of all people actively contributing to the Foundation‚Äôs projects. To be acknowledged as a member you need to meet the [criteria defined in our statutes](/statutes/) and apply for membership using our [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### Other entities and officers

There are some entities to help the BoD to further the foundation‚Äôs projects, but not being formal bodies of the foundation:

* The [TDF team](/team/) oversees various projects, and supports the community in their work.
* The [Engineering Steering Committee](/engineering-sc/) (or ‚ÄúESC‚Äù) provides technological guidance on strategic matters and hypothetically will consist of the Community‚Äôs best engineers.
* The [Advisory Board](/advisory-board/) (or ‚ÄúAB‚Äù) provides a forum for organizations providing a substantial minimum level of financial or other support as determined by the BoD, to meet with the BoD and provide advice.

The BoD may appoint officers for administration or daily business of the Foundation.

### CVE-2016-10327

**Title:**¬†CVE-2016-10327 Heap-buffer-overflow in EMF filter

**Announced:** April 21, 2017

**Fixed in:** LibreOffice 5.2.5/5.3.0

**Description**:

Enhanced Metafiles (EMF) can contain bitmap data preceded by a header and a field with in that header which states the offset from the start of the header to the bitmap data. An emf can be crafted to provide an illegal offset which if not tested for validity can trigger a heap buffer overflow.

All users are recommended to upgrade to LibreOffice >= 5.2.5 or >= 5.3.0 which sanity test the offset before use.
