Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssh-7.4p1-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.   This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.   ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside     a trusted whitelist.   sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain     sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.   sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to     privilege-separated child processes via realloc().   sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression     support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising     compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.     process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.   sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at     configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was     previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges     (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting     in granting access where it was not intended.

Message-Id: <4ab69cb56675d73a@openbsd.org>
Date: Mon, 19 Dec 2016 06:56:04 -0700 (MST)
From: Damien Miller <djm@...nbsd.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 7.4 released

OpenSSH 7.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
   SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
   with privilege separation disabled.

 * The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
   OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.

 * ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
   block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
   attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
   only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
   connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
   but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
   configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
   anyway.

 * sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
   in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
   cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
   attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
   default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.

 * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
   of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
   at run-time.

 * sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
   an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
   refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
   The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
   forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
   error-prone.

 * sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
   for having /bin/login manage login sessions.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
   outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
   load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
   could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
   agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
   result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
   attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
   running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
   of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
   client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
   domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
   'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
   Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
   (Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
   Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
   privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
   keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
   nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
   to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
   compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
   some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
   incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
   disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
   privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
   process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
   This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
   from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
   optimisation identification tool (<http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/>)

 * sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
   sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
   connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.

 * sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
   directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
   ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
   ranges (e.g. user@....1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
   possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
   Reported by Laurence Parry.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
   version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
   client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
   the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
   with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
   IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
   lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
   code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
   forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
   different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
   "ssh -O proxy ..."

 * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config DisableForwaring option that disables
   X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
   as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
   'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
   and future-proof way of restricting an account.

 * sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
   method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
   "curve25519-sha256@...ssh.org".

 * sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
   already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
   if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
   retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
   also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
   it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
   the case of a configuration error. bz#2641

 * sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
   directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.

 * sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
   those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
   fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
   contents of the certificate being offered.

 * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
   string sanitisation functions.

 * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
   certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
   certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).

 * ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
   authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
   method attempted. bz#2642

 * regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. bz#2639

 * ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to load
   keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
   detail in debug messages. bz#2610

 * ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
   pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.

 * sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
   suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the terminal mode
   correctly if suspended during a password prompt.

 * ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a password
   prompt.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
   info messages.

 * sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
   sequence NEWKEYS message.

 * sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
   the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547

 * sshd(8): Fix sending ext_info message if privsep is disabled.

 * sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
   separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
   only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
   in the configuration

 * sshd(8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
   on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.

 * Fix false positive reports caused by explicit_bzero(3) not being
   recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
   -fsanitize-memory.

 * sshd_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
   configuration examples.

Portability
-----------

 * On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
   C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
   that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. bz#2643

 * sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
   ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, ..)

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.

 * Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.

 * contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640

 * sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
   force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
   sandboxing.

 * All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
   and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
   OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
   years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
   if we're cross compiling.

SUMMARY

SCALANCE X-200RNA switch devices before V3.2.7 contain multiple OpenSSL and OpenSSH vulnera-
bilities. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow a denial of service condition or could lead to
execution of arbitrary code.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-8176

The dtls1_clear_queues function in ssl/d1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and
1.0.1 before 1.0.1h frees data structures without considering that application data can arrive between

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openssh (7.4p1). (BZ#1341754)

Security Fix(es):

* A covert timing channel flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled authentication of non-existent users. A remote unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this flaw to determine valid user names by measuring the timing of server responses. (CVE-2016-6210)
* It was found that OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to temporarily trigger high CPU consumption in sshd by sending long passwords. (CVE-2016-6515)
* It was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from arbitrary paths. An attacker having control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server, and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ssh-agent. (CVE-2016-10009)
* It was found that the host private key material could possibly leak to the privilege-separated child processes via re-allocated memory. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could therefore obtain the leaked key information. (CVE-2016-10011)
* It was found that the boundary checks in the code implementing support for pre-authentication compression could have been optimized out by certain compilers. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could possibly use this flaw for further attacks against the privileged monitor process. (CVE-2016-10012)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Consequently, existing configurations that depend on chrooting in user-non-searchable paths stopped working. With this update of the \_openssh\_ packages, the change has been reverted. Additionally, the problem has been fixed in the SELinux system policy by allowing confined users to use \*OpenSSH chroot\* if the administrator enables the `selinuxuser\_use\_ssh\_chroot` boolean. The described configurations now work in the same way as in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1435264](show_bug.cgi?id=1435264 "CLOSED ERRATA - openssh package openssh-6.6.1p1-33.el7_3 does not resolve chroot permission denied status.")

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1418062#c0)  Matt Mezynski    2017-01-31 18:23:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The package release as a resolution to [Bug 1398569](show_bug.cgi?id=1398569 "CLOSED ERRATA - sftp/ssh ignores group permissions") still faces Permission denied status in the chroot environment.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHEL 7.3 openssh-6.6.1p1-33.el7_3   How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install openssh-6.6.1p1-33.el7_3 2. root uid is now dropped before doing chroot  3. encounter permission denied messages  Actual results: chroot privileges not respected   Expected results: chroot privileges should be respected   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1418062#c2)  Jakub Jelen    2017-02-02 11:10:38 UTC  ``` As already pointed out in the personal mail it is certainly different behavior caused by the fix in the [bug #1357859](show_bug.cgi?id=1357859 "CLOSED ERRATA - guest_t can run sudo").  The root cause is that we now drop root UID before doing chroot so the target user does not have permissions to stat all parts of the chroot directory.  As a workaround we can set the x permission for others on all parts in the path to the chroot.  For RHEL7.4 we will have to investigate if we will revert this feature or will be able to resolve it in some other way.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1418062#c3)  Matt Mezynski    2017-02-02 18:48:34 UTC  ``` Hopefully we can approximate the chroot behavior from RHEL 6 in in the 7.4 release?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1418062#c5)  Jakub Jelen    2017-02-06 08:19:42 UTC  ``` Thank you for verifying the workaround. I will keep you updated on how we are going to fix that as soon as possible.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1418062#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-08-01 18:42:47 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

Remove support for pre-authentication compression. Doing compression

```
early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable in the 1990s, but
today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both cryptography (cf.
multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and attack surface.

Moreover, to support it across privilege-separation zlib needed
the assistance of a complex shared-memory manager that made the
required attack surface considerably larger.

Prompted by Guido Vranken pointing out a compiler-elided security
check in the shared memory manager found by Stack
(<http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/>); ok deraadt@ markus@

NB. pre-auth authentication has been disabled by default in sshd
for >10 years.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406293#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-20 08:35:20 UTC  ```  It was found that the shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising compilers.

=== Content from www.openssh.com_6f042d16_20250126_075535.html ===
OpenSSH 7.4 was released on 2016-12-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:
\* In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).
\* In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
\* The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
with privilege separation disabled.
\* The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.
Potentially-incompatible changes
================================
This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:
\* This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.
\* ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
anyway.
\* sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.
\* ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
at run-time.
\* sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
error-prone.
\* sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
for having /bin/login manage login sessions.
Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================
This is primarily a bugfix release.
Security
--------
\* ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
(Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
optimisation identification tool (http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/)
\* sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.
\* sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
Reported by Laurence Parry.
New Features
------------
\* ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
IDs, etc. This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
"ssh -O proxy ..."
\* sshd(8): Add a sshd\_config DisableForwarding option that disables
X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
'restrict' authorized\_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
and future-proof way of restricting an account.
\* sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".
\* sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
the case of a configuration error. bz#2641
\* sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
directives to appear in sshd\_config Match blocks.
\* sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
contents of the certificate being offered.
\* Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
string sanitisation functions.
\* Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
certificate id\_rsa-cert.pub (and no id\_rsa.pub).
\* ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
method attempted. bz#2642
\* regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. bz#2639
\* ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to load
keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
detail in debug messages. bz#2610
\* ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.
\* sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the terminal mode
correctly if suspended during a password prompt.
\* ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a password
prompt.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
info messages.
\* sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
sequence NEWKEYS message.
\* sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547
\* sshd(8): Fix sending ext\_info message if privsep is disabled.
\* sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
in the configuration
\* sshd(8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.
\* Fix false positive reports caused by explicit\_bzero(3) not being
recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
-fsanitize-memory.
\* sshd\_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
configuration examples.
Portability
-----------
\* On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. bz#2643
\* sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
ptrace(PT\_DENY\_ATTACH, ..)
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.
\* Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.
\* contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640
\* sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
sandboxing.
\* All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
if we're cross compiling.

Debian Bug     : 790798 793616 795711 848716 848717

Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the SSH protocol suite:

CVE-2015-5352

    OpenSSH incorrectly verified time window deadlines for X connections.
    Remote attackers could take advantage of this flaw to bypass intended
    access restrictions. Reported by Jann Horn.

CVE-2015-5600

    OpenSSH improperly restricted the processing of keyboard-interactive
    devices within a single connection, which could allow remote attackers
    to perform brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service, in a
    non-default configuration.

CVE-2015-6563

    OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames during PAM authentication. In
    conjunction with an additional flaw in the OpenSSH unprivileged child
    process, remote attackers could make use if this issue to perform user
    impersonation. Discovered by Moritz Jodeit.

CVE-2015-6564

    Moritz Jodeit discovered a use-after-free flaw in PAM support in
    OpenSSH, that could be used by remote attackers to bypass
    authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-1908

    OpenSSH mishandled untrusted X11 forwarding when the X server disables
    the SECURITY extension. Untrusted connections could obtain trusted X11
    forwarding privileges. Reported by Thomas Hoger.

CVE-2016-3115

    OpenSSH improperly handled X11 forwarding data related to
    authentication credentials. Remote authenticated users could make use
    of this flaw to bypass intended shell-command restrictions. Identified
    by github.com/tintinweb.

CVE-2016-6515

    OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication.
    Remote attackers could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service via long strings.

CVE-2016-10009

    Jann Horn discovered an untrusted search path vulnerability in
    ssh-agent allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary local
    PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.

CVE-2016-10011

    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH did not properly consider the
    effects of realloc on buffer contents. This may allow local users to
    obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a
    privilege-separated child process.

CVE-2016-10012

    Guido Vranken discovered that the OpenSSH shared memory manager
    did not ensure that a bounds check was enforced by all compilers,
    which could allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access
    to a sandboxed privilege-separation process.

CVE-2016-10708

    NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash via an out-of-sequence
    NEWKEYS message.

CVE-2017-15906

    Michal Zalewski reported that OpenSSH improperly prevent write
    operations in readonly mode, allowing attackers to create zero-length
    files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:6.7p1-5+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.
