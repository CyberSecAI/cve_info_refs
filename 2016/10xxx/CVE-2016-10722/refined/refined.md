Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-10722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the FAT superblock in `partclone.fat`.
*   Specifically, the `get_used_block()` function allocates memory for the FAT bitmap based on the `sectors` field of the FAT superblock.
*   The `mark_reserved_sectors()` function writes 1 bits into the FAT bitmap based on other fields of the FAT superblock without proper bounds checking.
*   An integer overflow in `get_cluster_count()` and crafted FAT entries processed by `check_fat*_entry()` functions allow writing arbitrary data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   Similar heap buffer overflows are present in `readbitmap()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Occurs when writing beyond the allocated memory buffer for the FAT bitmap.
*   **Integer overflow:** In the `get_cluster_count()` function, leading to incorrect calculation of the bitmap size.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** Missing validation of FAT superblock fields when writing to the bitmap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running `partclone.fat`.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overwriting heap memory could cause a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FAT filesystem image:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted FAT filesystem image to `partclone.fat` that triggers the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious FAT filesystem image as input to `partclone.fat`.
*   No special privileges or position is mentioned other than running the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found using the `american fuzzy lop (afl)` fuzzer.
*   The vulnerability affects `partclone.fat` version 0.2.87 and potentially older versions.
*   The issue was reported to the Partclone project.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Partclone 0.2.88.
*   The provided proof of concept involves crafting a FAT filesystem image with a specific size, fat\_length and modified FAT entries to trigger the overflow.
