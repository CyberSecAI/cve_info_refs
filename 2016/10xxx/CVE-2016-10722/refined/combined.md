The bleeding-edge wl1251 wifi driver for Maemo Fremantle is now available! It is based on the upstream bleeding-edge wireless-testing tree and incorporates nearly all features found in the stock wl12xx driver used in Maemo Fremantle, adds some bugfixes and also provides some unique features like packet injection. More information can be found on this page.

I have updated my monitor mode patch for the wl1251 chip to fix some bugs. First it is now possible to capture encrypted packets. I want to thank hardkorek for reporting this bug. Second I have fixed the data rate reported for received packets. Previously all packets showed up as 1Mb/s regardless of which data […]

Many of you may already have noticed that I have ported Kismet to the N900 with support for internal GPS through liblocation. Now also a fully functional WLAN monitor mode is available for the N900! You might know the channel 6 problem, it’s gone now! 🙂 So here you can download my monitor mode patch […]

Maybe you also wanted to know where the antennas are located in the N900. I have done a little research on this and now share my results. As you can see on the picture the GSM and UMTS antenna is located on the left side of the battery. Therefore it is on the bottom when […]

As some may have already noticed I have published my Kismet package in the extras-devel Repository a few days. Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. If you had already tried using Kismet on your N900 you will have noticed that Maemo Fremantle isn’t using gpsd anymore. As a […]

## Advisory: Partclone FAT Bitmap Heap Overflow (CVE-2016-10722)

Posted by **David** on November 14, 2016

During my semester abroad I experimented a bit with the great fuzzer [american fuzzy lop (afl)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Due to my background with the [OpenClone](http://openclone.nongnu.org/) project I was curious about the security of the [Partclone](http://partclone.org/) partition imaging software.

It didn't take long and afl found some crashes. I analyzed them, built proof-of-concepts and [reported](https://github.com/Thomas-Tsai/partclone/issues/71) the issues to the Partclone project.

Here you can find the full version of the first advisory. The vulnerability is fixed since Partclone 0.2.88.

Stay tuned for a second advisory. I will delay its publication, since the vulnerability is not fully fixed yet.

**Update:** CVE-2016-10722 was assigned to this issue.

Vendor description:
-------------------

Partclone is a partition imaging tool supporting the FAT filesystem.
Partclone is shipped by various Linux distributions and used by
specialized disk cloning systems like DRBL (http://drbl.org/),
Clonezilla (http://clonezilla.org/), Redo Backup
(http://redobackup.org/), ...

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------

partclone.fat is prone to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability
due to insufficient validation of the FAT superblock. An attacker may
be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running
the affected application.

The vulnerability is located in fatclone.c and bitmap.h.
get_used_block() allocates memory for the FAT bitmap based on the
sectors field of the FAT superblock. mark_reserved_sectors() then
writes a number of 1 bits into the FAT bitmap based on multiple other
fields of the FAT superblock but without bounds check, leading to a
buffer overflow.
Due to an integer overflow in get_cluster_count() and specially crafted
FAT entries processed by the check_fat*_entry() functions, an attacker
can also write arbitrary data beyond the bounds of the allocated
buffer.
readbitmap() is prone to similar heap buffer overflows.

Summarized enumeration of stack traces where heap overflows can happen
(only top 3 frames):
#0  pc_clear_bit          at bitmap.h:22
    pc_set_bit            at bitmap.h:15
#1  check_fat12_entry     at fatclone.c:337,341,345
    check_fat16_entry     at fatclone.c:309,313,317
    check_fat32_entry     at fatclone.c:282,286,290
    mark_reserved_sectors at fatclone.c:218,223,228
#2  get_used_block        at fatclone.c:467,485,487,489
    readbitmap            at fatclone.c:405,427,429,431

Integer overflow in get_cluster_count() fatclone.c:135
[...]
    data_sec = total_sector - ( fat_sb.reserved + (fat_sb.fats * sec_per_fat) + root_sec);
[...]

Proof of concept:
-----------------

The proof of concept filesystem was created using mkfs.fat from
dosfstools with a size of 68 blocks (34816 bytes) and cluster size of
1. For triggering the integer overflow, the fat_length is increased
from 0x01 to 0x12. The FAT entries are modified. To shorten the PoC,
the filesystem is truncated to 2048 bytes.

## Linux PHC for Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal

Posted by **David** on May 20, 2011

The PHC kernel for Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal is now available in [the linux-phc PPA on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~linux-phc/%2Barchive/ppa).

The Linux PHC project provides cpufreq kernel modules for undervolting Intel and AMD processors on a Linux platforms. This gives you the ability to save energy, lower the CPU temperature and expand battery time.

If you want to know more about Linux PHC take a look at the [Linux PHC forum](http://www.linux-phc.org/) and the [PHC wiki](http://www.linux-phc.org/wiki/). The installation notes for the PHC kernel can be found in [this thread](http://www.linux-phc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=133). If you are going to measure the total power consumption, keep in mind [the "10-30% increase in power consumption" bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/760131).

  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

  I have been waiting for this for my T60p and it works beautifully. It worked well in 10.10 and I had been really missing it in Natty.

  Along with TPFancontrol, this is one of my most valued pieces of software.

  Appreciate your good work.

  Does the phc patch really already work with 11.04?

  I tried to build the phc-intel-0.3.2-12-1.tar.bz2 module but all I get is:

  Makefile detected your kernel version as 2.6.38

  \*\*\*NO MATCHING PATCHSET FOUND FOR 2.6.38\*\*\*

  make: \*\*\* Keine Regel vorhanden, um das Target »phc-intel.c«,

  benötigt von »phc-intel.ko«, zu erstellen. Schluss.

  I’m glad if someone can help me out.

  Regards

    No, you also have to install the phc modules and configure the undervolting.

    The installation notes say “… The Maverick/Natty kernels do NOT include the PHC modules. It is only prepared for PHC, so you have to install the appropriate PHC modules yourself. This should be very easy with the offtree releases. (See Releases thread <http://www.linux-phc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=2>) …”

    You should also take a look at the wiki to understand, why undervolting will never work automatically without configuration. (<http://www.linux-phc.org/wiki/doku.php?id=phc_basics>)

  All of you having problems with the phc-intel package, you can find an updated phc-intel version in this thread:

  <http://www.linux-phc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=267>

  I haven’t tested it myself, but it looks like it is working.

  David,

  Have noticed that you’ve released the PHC kernel for Ubuntu 11.10. Thank you for your hard work. It is certainly appreciated.

Due to my background with the OpenClone project I was curious about the security of the Partclone partition imaging software. It didn’t take long and afl found some crashes. I analyzed them, built proof-of-concepts and reported the issues to […]
