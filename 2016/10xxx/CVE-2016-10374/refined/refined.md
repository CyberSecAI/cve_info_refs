Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10374:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from `perltidy`'s default behavior of writing error messages to files named `somefile.pl.ERR` in the current working directory. When `perltidy` detects an error while processing a file, it attempts to delete any existing `perltidy.ERR` file. However, if the deletion fails, `perltidy` proceeds without reporting the issue, creating a new `perltidy.ERR` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Insecure File Creation:** `perltidy` creates output files in the current working directory using predictable file names, specifically `perltidy.ERR`
2.  **Lack of Symlink Protection:** `perltidy` does not properly handle symlinks during file deletion and creation. It attempts to delete an existing file, but if that file is a symlink and the target cannot be deleted, it proceeds as if the deletion succeeded
3.  **Reliance on Current Working Directory:** The tool relies on the current working directory to create the error output file, making it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
4.  **Insecure Default Behavior:** The default setting of writing error output to files in the working directory is unsafe.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can create a symlink named `perltidy.ERR` in the current working directory that points to an arbitrary file that the attacker can write to. When `perltidy` is run and encounters an error it will try to remove the symlink. If that fails then `perltidy` will proceed to write the error output to the location pointed to by the symlink effectively overwriting the target file, leading to arbitrary file overwrites.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Local Symlink Attack:** A local user can create a symlink named `perltidy.ERR` (or `perltidy.LOG`) pointing to a file they want to overwrite.
2.  **Triggering an Error in perltidy:**  The user then runs `perlcritic` (or another tool that uses `perltidy`), triggering an error that causes `perltidy` to write its error output.
3.  **File Overwrite:** Due to the symlink, `perltidy` will overwrite the file pointed to by the symlink with the error output.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

1.  **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create symlinks and execute the vulnerable tools.
2.  **Ability to Trigger Perltidy Errors:** The attacker must be able to provide input that will cause `perltidy` to output an error message.
3.  **Write Access to Target File (via symlink):** The attacker must have write access to the target file that they are redirecting to via the symlink.

**Additional Details**
-   The vulnerability affects `perltidy` directly, and indirectly affects tools that use it, such as `perlcritic` and `check-all-the-things`.
-   The fix involves a backported patch to `perltidy` to address the insecure file deletion and ensure that error messages are not written to a potentially attacker-controlled location
-   The fix for CVE-2016-10374 was included in version `20140328-2` of `perltidy`.
-   The issue was initially reported as a vulnerability in `perlcritic` but was later determined to be a vulnerability in `perltidy`.
