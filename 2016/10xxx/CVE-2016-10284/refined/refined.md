{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm video driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control within the Qualcomm video driver allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a local privilege escalation, allowing arbitrary code execution within the kernel context. This could result in a permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the device."
