<!‚Äì wp:paragraph ‚Äì>
<p class=‚Äù‚Äù>2+ years later and I still feel the same way about this plugin. This plugin does exactly what it says‚Ä¶ creates pages in bulk quickly. I‚Äôve been using this plugin for years and it is always one of the first plugins I install in a site to build out my site‚Äôs navigation. I highly recommend this plugin!</p>

I am a web designer and I don‚Äôt understand why this plugin is so inconsiderate. It‚Äôs the best there is, it makes me a lot of work.

It is very convenient to compose a structure of pages and subpages in a text document, and then create them all in a second together with their hierarchy.

You can export mindmaps from Mindmeister via textexport and then import with this plug-in. Viola added 500 pages struktur. Very nice.
