{
  "CVE-2016-10173": {
    "Description": "The rubygem minitar and archive-tar-minitar are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the libraries handle filenames within tar archives. Specifically, they don't properly sanitize filenames containing '..' sequences, which allows for directory traversal during extraction.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system where the archive is extracted, potentially leading to code execution, data corruption, or other forms of system compromise, depending on what files are overwritten.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious tar archive with filenames containing '..' sequences. When a vulnerable application uses the minitar or archive-tar-minitar library to extract this archive, the malicious files can be written to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious tar archive and have a vulnerable application extract it. This could occur through various means, such as a user downloading and extracting the archive or an automated system processing the archive.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability affects both minitar and archive-tar-minitar rubygems, as they share the same vulnerable codebase.",
        "The fix for the vulnerability involves adding checks to reject relative paths (paths with '..') during file extraction.",
        "The vulnerability is analogous to vulnerabilities in unzip and tar (CVE-2001-1268 and CVE-2001-1267)",
          "The fix also handles existing symbolic links by removing them before extracting the file."
