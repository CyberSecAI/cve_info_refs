[`a0b56c4`](/sfackler/rust-openssl/commit/a0b56c437803a08413755928040a0970a93a7b83)

The 0.9 release brings many major changes.

# OpenSSL version support

This crate now supports the newly released 1.1.0 version of OpenSSL. Massive

thanks to [@alexcrichton](https://github.com/alexcrichton) for driving this forward and implementing the changes

necessary to deal with the significant API changes in OpenSSL!

OpenSSL versions 0.9.8 and 1.0.0 have reached their end of life and are no

longer receiving security updates. As a result, this crate no longer supports

linking against them.

# openssl-sys changes

## Version and feature detection

openssl-sys now inspects the headers in the target OpenSSL installation,

extracting the version as well as build time options. These are used to provide

FFI bindings which are accurate to that specific configuration. Functions have

been added or removed, or even changed signatures across versions. This

information is exposed by the build script so that downstream crates may

conditionally compile themselves as appropriate.

To ensure these bindings remain accurate over time, we now use the `systest`

crate to automatically verify that the functions, constants, and struct

definitions correctly represent their C equivalents. This process has found

several issues, including incorrect signedness, constness, and even extra

function parameters!

## Build script improvements

The build script detection logic has been significantly improved. It will

automatically detect OpenSSL installed via Homebrew on OSX. If it fails to find

an installation, it will print a message explaining what steps need to be

taken. The separate `OPENSSL_LIB_DIR` and `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR` environment

variables have been merged into a single `OPENSSL_DIR` variable. This should

minimize the likelyhood of linking against a version that does not correspond

to the headers that were detected.

The build script will output the version of OpenSSL being linked against as

well as the OpenSSL build configuration (`OPENSSL_NO_COMP` for example).

Downstream crates can link against `openssl-sys` to conditionally compile code

to support multiple versions when necessary. See `openssl`'s build script for

reference.

## Probe module

The probe module has been removed, as it does not really belong in this crate.

# openssl changes

## SSL configuration

OpenSSL's SSL/TLS support is a minefield; it's default configuration is highly

insecure, and it is nontrivial to turn all of the right knobs in the right

ways. New types have been added which wrap `SslContext` and `Ssl`, managing all

of that for you. **You should probably never use the `Ssl` type directly to

create an `SslStream`**.

Clients should use the `SslConnector` type. Servers should use the

`SslAcceptor` type, which supports several configurations based off of

Mozilla's server side TLS recommendations.

## Other SSL APIs

The `SslContext` type is now immutable. It is reference counted and shared by

all `SslStreams` created from it, and so mutation of it is not thread safe.

There is now an `SslContextBuilder` which can be used to configure it.

`SslStream`'s constructors have been moved to methods on `Ssl` and the

`IntoSsl` trait has been removed.

The hostname verification APIs added in OpenSSL 1.0.2 have been exposed through

the `Ssl::param_mut` method.

`SslContextBuilder::set_tmp_ecdh` was added to configure the ECDH curve used by

a server.

Fatal handshake errors will contain a `MidHandshakeSslStream` when possible,

allowing the specific certificate validation error to be displayed in error

messages, and retrieval of other information from the `Ssl`.

`Ssl::shutdown` has been added to properly shutdown an SSL session.

## Feature overhaul

The crate now only has two features - `v102` and `v110`. They correspond to

asking for functionality exposed in OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 and 1.1.0

respectively, when the library is actually being linked against that version.

For example, the `SslContextBuilder::set_ecdh_auto` method will be exposed if

the `v102` feature is activated and `openssl-sys` links against OpenSSL 1.0.2.

The `Ssl::params_mut` method will be exposed if either the `v102` feature is

activated and `openssl-sys` links against OpenSSL 1.0.2, *or* the `v110`

feature is activated and `openssl-sys` links against OpenSSL 1.1.0.

## De-enumification

Many enums have been converted to opaque wrapper types, including `Nid`,

`Cipher`, and `SslMethod`.

## Ref types

All OpenSSL types have been split into two - an owned type and a reference

type, for example `SslContext` and `SslContextRef`. The owned type derefs to

the reference type, and most methods are defined on the reference type.

## Signatures

The `Signer` type can sign data with a `PKey`, and the `Verifier` type can

verify a signature against a `PKey`.

The `hmac` module and the `sign` and `verify` methods on the `Dsa` and `Rsa`

types have been removed in favor of these new APIs.

## BigNum

The `BigNum` APIs have been overhauled. In particular, a `BigNumContext` type

has been added, corresponding to the OpenSSL `BN_CTX` type. Some operations

have been moved to `BigNumContext`, as they require it for scratch space.

## RSA

RSA encryption and decryption is now supported.

## Symmetric encryption

AES GCM is now supported.

## Renamings

Modules previously placed under the `crypto` module have been moved to the

crate root.

Types have been camel-cased - `RSA` is now `Rsa`, for example.
