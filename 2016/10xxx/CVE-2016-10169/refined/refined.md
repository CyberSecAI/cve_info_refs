Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-10169:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect handling of certain WV files within the WavPack library. Specifically, a global buffer overread occurs in the `read_code` function, located in `read_words.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overread in `read_code` function.
- The `read_new_config_info` function in `open_utils.c` also has an issue where it does not check if `bytecnt` is sufficient before dereferencing `byteptr`, potentially causing an out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted WV file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted WV file to the WavPack library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
- A patch for the issue is included in the commit `4bc05fc490b66ef2d45b1de26abf1455b486b0dc`.
- The fix involves checking if `low > high` and setting `high = low` if this condition is true within the `get_word` function in `read_words.c`, and also checking if the byte count is sufficient before dereferencing the byte pointer in `read_new_config_info` function in `open_utils.c`
- The issue was fixed in Ubuntu as part of the USN-3568-1 security update.
- The affected Ubuntu versions are 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS.
