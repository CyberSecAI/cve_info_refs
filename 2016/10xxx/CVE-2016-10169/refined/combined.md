## Packages

* [wavpack](/security/cves?package=wavpack) - audio codec (lossy and lossless) - encoder and decoder

## Details

Hanno Böck discovered that WavPack incorrectly handled certain

WV files. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial

of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu

16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-10169](/security/CVE-2016-10169))

Joonun Jang discovered that WavPack incorrectly handled certain

RF64 files. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial

of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 17.10. ([CVE-2018-6767](/security/CVE-2018-6767))

Note that <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/23/4> had an
incorrect URL for the open_utils.c issue. (It was a duplicate of the
previous URL.) The correct URL is in the quoted text above. Also, the
vendor response of "I am pretty confident that these particular
failures are not exploitable, although I am not an expert in that
area" is on the
<https://sourceforge.net/p/wavpack/mailman/message/35618215/> page.

We are assigning the four CVE IDs to the individual reports even
though it is possible that
4bc05fc490b66ef2d45b1de26abf1455b486b0dc implies that there were
only three independent issues.

Two of the three fixes here are only related to features added since 4.80, so they would not apply. Only the fix in read\_words.c could be backported.

There have actually been several other similar fixes since 4.80, but many of these are also specific to new features, and so would have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. Also, some of the fixes affect only encoding (not decoding) so they do not pose a risk.

I do not understand the rationale behind trying to apply these fixes to previous versions, especially because applying the patches without all the context and more testing could even trigger other issues.

Wouldn't it be just as easy to upgrade to the most recent release? The current release has been extensively tested by AFL and is probably the most robust WavPack release to date. It is also 100% functionally compatible with 4.80 (no broken apps).

> Wouldn't it be just as easy to upgrade to the most recent release?

Hello , oops I think I confused WavPack with touchsound , I though I can't update it without rebuild a bunch of packages do a soname bump [1] , so now, IIRC is smooth update wavpack (all others packages will still work) I will update first on f26 and in my local computer if no problems , I will update lower versions and also EPEL packages.

Thank you for the feedback.
