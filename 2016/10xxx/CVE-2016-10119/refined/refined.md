Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure mounting of `/tmp` as a `tmpfs` file system with mode `0777` (read, write, and execute permissions for all users). This occurred because the default mount options for `/tmp` within Firejail were too permissive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness was the overly permissive `0777` mode on the `/tmp` directory when mounted as `tmpfs`. This allowed any user to create, modify, or delete files within the `/tmp` directory.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The insecure `/tmp` directory could be used to perform privilege escalation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could use the world-writable `/tmp` to overwrite or create files and directories, enabling privilege escalation, for example, by placing a malicious setuid binary in the directory and executing it.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Firejail is running.
- **Firejail Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to execute firejail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a non-privileged local user on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute `firejail` with the default configuration that was vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Firejail before the fix commit `aa28ac9e09557b833f194f594e2940919d940d1f`. After this fix,  `/tmp` is mounted with stricter permissions.
- The provided text specifically mentions that "Mode 0777 considered harmful" and provides an example of potential privesc via a system utility used with `"--caps.keep=setuid"`.
- The provided text states that, /dev, /dev/shm, /var/tmp, /var/lock were also mounted 0777 prior to commit `cd0ecfc7a7b30abde20db6dea505cd8c58e7c046` which was addressed by CVE-2016-10120.
- The provided text also mentions that `/dev/shm/firejail` was also 0777 prior to commit `1cab02f5ae3c90c01fae4d1c16381820b757a3a6` which was addressed by CVE-2016-10121.
