{
  "CVE-2016-10011": {
    "Description": "It was found that the host private key material could possibly leak to the privilege-separated child processes via re-allocated memory. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could therefore obtain the leaked key information.",
    "Root cause": "A theoretical leak of host private key material via realloc() when reading keys.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Leak of host private key material to the privilege-separated child processes due to memory reallocation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could obtain the leaked key information.",
    "Attack vector": "Exploitation requires compromising a sandboxed privilege-separation process.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "Requires an attacker to first compromise the sandboxed privilege-separation process, typically by exploiting another vulnerability."
