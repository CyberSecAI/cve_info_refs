# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE request: sunxi-debug (root privilege escalation in Allwinner kernel)

The official Allwinner 3.4 kernels (H3, H8 and A83T) shipped a driver
called sunxi-debug, which allows any process (file permissions are set to
666) to escalate to root without any interaction.

Full PoC/"exploit" is simply:

echo "rootmydevice" > /proc/sunxi_debug/sunxi_debug

This was originally spotted in April 2016 and removed after media coverage
in May. If a CVE could be assigned to it, that would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David Manouchehri

Posted May 2, 2016

**EDIT: This is NOT about a (hidden) backdoor but just a local privileges escalation that affects one single 3.4 kernel variant for 2 Allwinner SoCs. In case you came here through lurid headlines please read [this comment here](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/chinese-arm-vendor-left-developer-backdoor-in-kernel-for-android-pi-devices/?comments=1&post=31168921) first and help stop spreading further BS like "all Allwinner devices contain a *hidden* backdoor" -- the code has been found since Allwinner could be convinced to open their Github repos in the past so everyone is able to audit their Android kernel source!**

It has been brought to our attention two days ago on 2016-04-30 in linux-sunxi IRC that Allwinner's 3.4 legacy kernel for H3/A83T/H8 contains a nasty local privileges escalation. Any process running with any UID can become root easily by simply doing this:

```

echo "rootmydevice" > /proc/sunxi_debug/sunxi_debug

```

Combined with networked services that might allow access to /proc this means that this is also a network enabled root exploit. As usual we [fixed such an issue within a few hours](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/lib/issues/282), on May 1st new Armbian 5.10 images were rolled out and in the meantime the fix is also in Armbian's apt repo so **please upgrade now** (apt-get update/upgrade or start with a fresh OS image) if you're affected! If you're already running Armbian 5.10 then this vulnerability is already fixed.

This security flaw is currently present in every OS image for H3, A83T or H8 devices that rely on Kernel 3.4: this applies to all OS images available for Orange Pis (except Armbian 5.10 available since May 1st), any for FriendlyARM's NanoPi M1, SinoVoip's M2+ and M3, Cuebietech's Cubietruck + and Linksprite's pcDuino8 Uno

We informed all vendors where possible also two days ago (FriendlyARM and SinoVoip took notice, the others still ignore the issue)

* FriendlyARM: <https://github.com/friendlyarm/h3_lichee/issues/1>
* SinoVoip M3: <https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M3-bsp/issues/10>

Users of any of the available OS images for H3 based Orange Pis are somewhat lost since none of the OS images or kernels used for these are maintained any longer. Loboris disappeared (so the [opened issue is more like a reference](https://github.com/loboris/OrangePI-Kernel/issues/20)) and Xunlong themselves do not maintain their software at all (not even possible to open an issue there).

In case some readers here do also have accounts at Orange Pi forums, please spread the word and inform the users that their OS images are exploitable unless they already use Armbian 5.10. Same applies to Banana Pi forums, please spread the word there also that all M3 and their M2+ OS images are affected (I deleted my account there since talking to @sinovoip is like talking to a wall and just makes me sick, but it might be worth the efforts to try to warn their users)

Original BSP kernel is designed for Android, where getting root privileges in "one click" would be very useful for testing and debugging purposes...

... if only there was a simple way (even kernel config symbol!) to disable this for production / public images.

This security flaw has been proudly produced by Allwinner itself: <https://github.com/allwinner-zh/linux-3.4-sunxi/blob/master/arch/arm/mach-sunxi/sunxi-debug.c>

As Zador explained there might be good reasons to enable/use something like this while developing, the real problem ist that none of these devs does really care about Linux and 'productive use' (and security at all). That's one of the reasons no one wants to use these BSP kernels since you never know how many surprises like this are hidden in there.

Fortunately mainlining efforts for H3 are still progressing nicely so we can throw this Allwinner 3.4 crap in the bin rather sooner than later ![:)](https://forum.armbian.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png)

Well unless it is a problem in Chrome browser on my Android M8 ( S802) TV box, when I just tried the resources tab on Orange Pi Org the downloads, github, wiki links are not working. Wonder if with security problem they have been disabled?

BTW: The FriendlyARM folks were the only paying attention to this security flaw and now do it exactly that way: <https://github.com/friendlyarm/h3_lichee/commit/5d4d02b1c8f336ba002eed4d97dee3a51ea76cdd>

@tkaiser, you should bump the package number for Armbian (5.10a..) or something. because the update / upgrade won't force an update right now.

Sorry, I don't understand. 5.10 contains the necessary fixes for rootmydevice already and there is no more recent version released. What are you asking for?

You said, we have to do apt-get update / upgrade to latest 5.10 (2 days old).  I didn't do an upgrade since 3 or 4 days, I'm already w/ kernel package 5.10. so nothing to update ..

I wonder if you're deep enough into intercultural differences to understand anything? At least I'm not and I consider many things that happen in China as a miracle (and I would suspect that's the same regarding us Westerners when looking at us from China).

You should be aware that you're *not* an Allwinner customer and that this whole SBC thing is close to irrelevant for them. The vast majority of their customers produces Android devices and Allwinner supports them as much as they can. Compared to this large Android market the count of Allwinner SoCs used with Linux is laughable (even if you consider customers like Olimex that order tens of thousands for boards used in industrial environment).

Considering this I even understand that Open Source proponents inside Allwinner might have a hard time. But it seems there are some since they do release their kernel sources (even if there are some BLOBs inside). Please keep in mind: This whole issue has been discovered since we were able to audit the code (different story is that they could help us with better commit logs and so on but at least looking through nearly all code is possible).

I really hope that this incident doesn't stop Allwinner opening even more code (with useable licenses and not just "All rights reserved") since even if the Linux market seems to be small/irrelevant they get so much back from linux-sunxi community (better code, mainline kernel code and also a better reputation since most older Allwinner SoCs run perfectly fine with mainline kernel due to community's work. And support for the most recent ones is progressing nicely. An Armbian image with mainline kernel for H3 boards is not that far away since linux-sunxi community does such a great coding job!).

So let's stop speculating/badmouthing and hope for the best instead!

A little thought springs to mind, if I take Aliexpress Orange Pi boards for sale figures and add Banana Pi sale figures, friendlyarm, Olinuxino on just H3 soc that is growing tens of thousands extra sales of H3 soc above and beyond Android use in TV box, Dongle and Tablets.

So if these customer buy a extra 70,000 H3 socs is that still a small market to ignore compared to Android millions of sales. Allwinner states the company culture is

With the mission of â€œimproving the life quality through value innovationâ€, Allwinner is always in pursuit of excellence to make a sustainable industry leader.

Allwinner always sticks to the corporation value of "market-orientation, integrity and responsibility, great execution, courage and discipline, profession and quality, openness and win-win, and persistence", and insists the corporation culture of "teamwork, honest and respect, profession and fairness, faith, openness and curiosity".

BTW: Funny example how to deal with 'rootmydevice' on a distro where everything should happen as root anyway:

I wanted to understand why users who chose to use a distro that does not care that much about security did care about 'rootmydevice' (they are already logged in as root so why do they fear a root exploit?!). Doesn't work, distro maintainer constantly deletes my questions ![:)](https://forum.armbian.com/uploads/emoticons/default_smile.png)

This scares me a bit since censorship is not exactly the right way to address security concerns.

On a related note: today in linux-sunxi IRC an Allwinner Github repo has been spotted with kernel sources for Allwinner's so called "Tina OS". Funnily the kernel tree useable for R16 (the same as the already known A33 tablet SoC) still contains the ['rootmydevice' functionality](https://github.com/tinalinux/linux-3.4/blob/r16-v2.1.y/arch/arm/mach-sunxi/sunxi-debug.c) but this time it's disabled by default and needs to be enabled (you would've to set CONFIG\_ROOT\_DEVICE to enable the debug functionality)

Thomas,

If you can clearly define an issue with DietPi and/or its security, please make a git ticket and we will look into it.

In the mean time, I will continue to delete all "hear say" posts with no relevant proof of your claims.

It would also be worth noting, that, only your posts have ever been deleted, in the history of DietPi project.

Censorship is ALWAYS wrong. No matter how much you disagree with someone's opinion, the right to voice an opinion is crucial in any civilized discourse. In a weak and decadent world only "nice" people are tolerated, while the dedicated and ambitious ones who actually get things done and are ready to stand up for a cause are loathed.

Fourdee,

Thomas said that "rootmydevice" does not increase security risk at DietPi.  Please enlighten me how fixing this function increased security at DietPi.

Thanks.

Nah, I said that the whole 'issue' wasn't that much of an issue (especially when using a distro that is designed to be a single-user system where everything runs with UID==0 like DietPi). And that puzzled me -- why do DietPi users who use a distro that is designed to be 'root only' fear 'root exploits'? Was just for my personal understanding and to get stuff publicly documented as it is now.

I don't believe any discussion will help. We tried to support DietPi as much as possible over the last 6 months (and we're glad that we could help [providing a lot of improvements for DietPi users](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepibbsen/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=662&extra=&page=8)) but now for me a red line has been crossed (twice). We tried several times to explain why and how Armbian's understanding of security differs from DietPi's (to no avail) and I got a bit angry with Igor since he accepted an absolutely useless PR. But as soon as someone starts censoring opinions it's over. Same with blaming Armbian being responsible for DietPi not fixing 'high priority' bugs in time: <https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/issues/312#issuecomment-253204102>

Sorry, if it's about preventing access to a sysfs node */proc/sunxi\_debug/sunxi\_debug* then simply do it: *chmod 000 /proc/sunxi\_debug/sunxi\_debug* (and you're already done. If you lack the skills to build an OS image from scratch then provide a fix for your users and **don't blame others** providing you with a build system for your requirements you can't cope with due to your various special requirements)

Anyway: I don't support people deleting stuff I write (any more). Fortunately for DietPi users other Armbian devs handle this differently so DietPi users can still rely on a solid foundation for their distro of choice. The collection of links above is just necessary for the commit message when I'll remove the unsafe and absolutely useless code that has been submitted recently to Armbian in a few days (since there's no excuse to weaken default Armbian security)

Because even if doesn't make any difference for processes started as logged in user, there are many services (mostly of "server" type) that run from special restricted accounts, and there privileges escalation is still a consideration.

Anyway, let's end this discussion for now, at least until we have to deal with new kernel sources for other SoC that may have this debug "feature".

Sure but that doesn't help that much when the whole distro is constructed around a 'everything runs as root' principle anyway. DietPi stores sensitive information in world-readable files (Wi-Fi credentials in /etc/network/interfaces for example) so privileges separation won't work there as it's supposed to anyway. And while that's just a problem for DietPi users I really hate when such 'design decisions' arrive at Armbian.

But you're right, let's stop this useless discussion, get rid of dangerous code soon and (note to myself) the next time we provide such a security advisory like this we'll provide the simple workarounds for users of other distros also immediately (to fix laughable stuff like rootmydevice a 'chmod 000' is enough, no need to waste days switching to another distro as foundation)

Even though it's a bit off-topic, using PSK key from wpa\_passphrase still protects original passphrase (keep in mind this still was "recommended" by layout of our [default interfaces file](https://github.com/igorpecovnik/lib/blob/d02693bb506fc89083f65596f59e57ec7bef4165/config/network/interfaces.default) before accepting @Fourdee's PR), and recovering deleted file /boot/armbian\_first\_run.txt requires root (or "disk" group) privileges to even read block device:

```

root@odroidc2:~# ls -la /dev/mmc*
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179, 0 Oct 13 00:39 /dev/mmcblk0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 179, 1 Oct 13 00:39 /dev/mmcblk0p1

```

My desktop is win7 because I have some odd old software. Everything else in my house is linux.

[03:40](#16307807)
<willmore>
I would love to find a way to remove the crazy old functionality from the desktop.

[03:40](#16307808)

it's a pig on resources

[03:42](#16307831)
<willmore>
There is a donut place in the US called "dunkin donuts". Years (decades, really) ago, they had a commercial about a franchise owner looking forward to 'making the donuts (at 4am)'.

[03:42](#16307832)
<lennyraposo>
not to mention setting up a windows machine

[03:43](#16307833)
<willmore>
As the ad wore on, he got less excited.

[03:43](#16307835)
<lennyraposo>
the hours of updates befor ethe system is at a production point

[03:43](#16307839)
<willmore>
So, 'making the donuts' means 'doing the drudgery that makes the money'.

[03:43](#16307840)
<willmore>
Sorry, no real donuts.

[03:43](#16307841)
<lennyraposo>

[06:15](#16308630)
<oneinsect>
i already built armbian image

[06:15](#16308631)

its build system does crosscompilation itself

[06:15](#16308633)

i am trying to see

<oneinsect>
how to cross

[06:15](#16308637)
<oneinsect>
only a driver

[06:15](#16308640)
<KotCzarny>
isnt there option somewhere to enable that extras?

<oneinsect>
trying to make sense

[06:15](#16308642)
<oneinsect>
make -s -j4 ARCH=$ARCHITECTURE CROSS\_COMPILE="$CROSS\_COMPILE" LINUX\_SRC=$SOURCES/$LINUXSOURCEDIR/

[06:15](#16308643)
<KotCzarny>
anyway, ask igorpec or tkaiser

[06:15](#16308644)
<oneinsect>
what $ARCHITECUTR and what cross\_complie mean

[06:15](#16308645)
<oneinsect>
yes

[06:15](#16308646)
<KotCzarny>
or just browse armbian forums

[06:16](#16308647)
<oneinsect>
yes

[06:16](#16308649)
<IgorPec>
arch is usually armhf while cross\_compile is a compiler which you use ... if you compile native , leave that

<plaes>
prasannatsm: does your tablet have wiki page yet?

[07:49](#16309091)
<NiteHawk>
oops, yes i was wrong there - you're reading from device memory, so you don't need the SPL

[07:49](#16309098)
<prasannatsm>
nope. I could not find it. I guess I have to create one.

[07:50](#16309104)
<prasannatsm>
I am trying to fetch the .fex, create a devicetree for it.

[07:52](#16309110)
<NiteHawk>
the "read" commands obviously rely on a specific memory layout / load addresses of boot1 and script.bin - those might not match your device...

[07:52](#16309111)
<NiteHawk>
what method did you use to enter FEL, keypress on power-on or UART?

[07:53](#16309114)
<prasannatsm>
pressing vol+ and power button together

[07:53](#16309119)
<prasannatsm>
this is not a development board so I don't have access to UART directly. Its a finished tablet.

[07:54](#16309122)
<NiteHawk>
i see. (uart would probably mean microsd breakout)

[07:54](#16309126)
<prasannatsm>
so what does error -7 mean? I guess it is some USB IO error.

[07:56](#16309131)
<prasannatsm>
how much does the read command take usually?

[07:56](#16309135)
<NiteHawk>
it a rather unspecific "timeout", unfortunately. probably indicates that the FEL stack has crashed / is no longer responding

[07:58](#16309137)
<prasannatsm>
I think the USB connector may not be working well. I used to have usb connection issue.

[08:01](#16309152)
<NiteHawk>
try to dump the first few bytes of those memory ranges, e.g. "./sunxi-fel hex 0x42400000 16"

[08:02](#16309153)
<prasannatsm>
ok. will check if that works.

[08:02](#16309155)
<NiteHawk>
if that works, it may be an interrupted transfer of the larger blocks - but i suspect the hexdump will fail with the same error

[08:05](#16309166)
<NiteHawk>
my suspicion is that - contrary to the wiki description - the device may not be initialized ("boot1"). i can reproduce the error -7 on my A20 when i do a "clean" FEL boot without SPL loaded. it's only after "./sunxi-fel spl ..." that the read command can properly access DRAM (addresses >= 0x40000000)

[08:06](#16309168)
<prasannatsm>
yes even reading the first few bytes fail with the same error.

[08:06](#16309177)
<prasannatsm>
how do I get the spl file or uboot?

[08:10](#16309192)
<NiteHawk>
that's a bit tricky, as it's probably stored in nand on the tablet. if the vendor provides a firmware image, it may be possible to extract boot0 (or u-boot) from that - but i've never taken that route...

[08:11](#16309200)

[08:12](#16309208)

prasannatsm: i'm not sure that a "generic" spl from u-boot for another device would work on yours

[08:12](#16309209)
<prasannatsm>
NiteHawk: Flatfish is the name of the tablet.

[08:12](#16309210)

[08:14](#16309214)
<libv>
hrm, how not to do a device page: <http://linux-sunxi.org/Intenso_TAB744>

[08:14](#16309215)
<NiteHawk>
okay, if you're able to build u-boot, then the sunxi-fel utility should get you started with either "spl" or actually loading u-boot

[08:14](#16309216)
<prasannatsm>
If that could work I will be able to test it tonight. How will I be able to boot into uboot mode? Once I am in uboot will I be able to use sunxi-fel tool?

[08:14](#16309217)
<plaes>
prasannatsm: please start with here: <https://linux-sunxi.org/New_Device_howto>

[08:15](#16309226)
<NiteHawk>
sunxi-fel read/write should work as soon as you've loaded SPL (which initializes DRAM). u-boot can be loaded via FEL too, i'm just not sure how much of it will be of use to you if you don't have access to a serial console (yet)

Its not easy to remove the tablet case and access the UART pins.

why do you need to access the UART pins?

[08:22](#16309274)

you mean NAND on H3, or H3 in general?

[09:12](#16309625)
<plaes>
NAND in H3

[09:12](#16309626)
\* jelle
wonders which H3 boards have nand

[09:12](#16309627)
<plaes>
is it the same controller?

[09:12](#16309633)
<bbrezillon>
I'm pretty sure it's the same controller

[09:12](#16309635)

[09:13](#16309643)

isn't emmc different from nand?

[09:14](#16309645)

it is

Amit\_T: if I understand the second frame is never sent ?

[09:15](#16309648)

[09:15](#16309654)
<jelle>
nice

[09:17](#16309665)
<Amit\_T>
montjoie : Yes.It never sent on wire.

[09:18](#16309677)
<Amit\_T>
Also, how many sequences of packet exchange takes place for ping to work?

[09:20](#16309696)
<montjoie>
Amit\_T: arp(2) then ping

[09:20](#16309699)
<Amit\_T>
montjoie: you mean to say 4 in total

[09:20](#16309700)
<montjoie>
Amit\_T: try restart dma after each packet and print DMA STATE register

[09:20](#16309705)
<montjoie>
the DMA TX state will let you know if DMA is stopped and why

[09:21](#16309712)
<montjoie>
and check if your current descriptor is the same than HW current desc

[09:22](#16309715)
<Amit\_T>
sorry but didn't get your final point ?

[09:22](#16309719)

KotCzarny, NiteHawk, plaes: thanks for the heads up :)

[09:25](#16309729)
<montjoie>
Amit\_T: when the hardware sent a frame it then go the next descriptor (the 4\*u32 structure). you can see it in TX\_DMA\_CURR\_DESC

[09:26](#16309733)
<KotCzarny>
libv: thanks for the servicing time ;)

hmm... looks like ${u-boot}/include/configs/sunxi-common.h is already differentiating various SoCs - maybe sun8i should get its own setup, too?

<NiteHawk>
those ~24k seem to be the smallest common denominator based on sun4i

[10:31](#16310046)

(and looking at that i don't think that IRQ and application stacks are accounted for wrt CONFIG\_SPL\_MAX\_SIZE)

SMP is a no-brainer, because this a firmware thing, the kernel always uses PSCI

[12:27](#16310734)
<apritzel>
(on arm64, this is)

[12:27](#16310736)

<alpha\_one\_x86>
ha..., usb not important for me but I need ethernet

[12:32](#16310766)
<jelle>
with usb you can get internet ;-)

[12:32](#16310767)
<apritzel>
alpha\_one\_x86: because it makes the DT different, so it cannot go in at the moment

[12:32](#16310771)
<apritzel>
alpha\_one\_x86: well, give it a try: the interface shows up, but ifconfig does not work, as the MAC reset times out

[12:33](#16310774)
<apritzel>
I reckon it's some kind of missing power for the PHY

[12:34](#16310776)
<apritzel>
but looking at the schematics I don't see that that should be a problem

[12:34](#16310781)
<alpha\_one\_x86>
Then I can't use pine64+ and odroid C2 at moment with mainline...

[12:35](#16310789)

[12:35](#16310793)

alpha\_one\_x86: btw: what is the state of the Odroid C2 mainline support?

alpha\_one\_x86: what about Ethernet or USB? Can one use NFS root?

[12:37](#16310804)

[12:38](#16310806)

with swap over nfs? ;)

[12:39](#16310810)

wens: right now, thanks to the 24KiB limit, we have 8KiB of stack available for the SPL (32KiB - 24KiB), which is more than enough

[15:52](#16312632)
<ssvb>
wens: the SPL for A64 is a bit special, because if we are linking the libdram binary blob, then we go over the 24KiB limit

[15:54](#16312651)
<ssvb>
wens: we should be able to set the stack somewhere at the 40KiB boundary for A64 and A80 (hence the comments in the code), but the libdram blob was failing to work correctly in this setup for some unknown reason

[15:55](#16312660)
<apritzel>
ssvb: speaking of A64 SPL: do you plan to push those sunxi-fel patches upstream to sunxi-tools?

[15:55](#16312661)
<apritzel>
I am using them happily for some time now ...

[15:55](#16312662)
<ssvb>
wens: I did verify that the SRAM between the 32KiB and 40KiB is accessible for reading and writing, and also that the libdram blob does not try to modify this area

[15:56](#16312669)
<apritzel>
ssvb: or are you holding them back until this is clarified?

[15:56](#16312675)
<ssvb>
wens: so I'm a bit puzzled about why it fails, but was not particularly thrilled about debugging the binary blob

I think I loaded scp.bin also some time ago

[15:59](#16312691)
<apritzel>
could give it a try again

[15:59](#16312692)

apritzel: more like how we would need to modify the instructions at <http://linux-sunxi.org/FEL/USBBoot#Booting_the_whole_system_over_USB_>.28U-Boot\_.2B\_kernel\_.2B\_initramfs.29 to accommodate the A64

[15:59](#16312693)
<apritzel>
If you send those patches out, I can give my Tested-by:

[15:59](#16312694)

apritzel: and still keep this stuff user friendly

[15:59](#16312695)
<NiteHawk>
ssvb: in theory we could do the scratch buffer (addr) adjustment and readl/writel functionality independently, right?

[16:01](#16312705)
<ssvb>
NiteHawk: yes, the readl/writel functionality is not directly related to A64 support

[16:01](#16312707)
<NiteHawk>
it would allow to move forward with the "sid" command

[16:01](#16312709)

is video "encoding" supported by allwinner h3

i might consider proposing a corresponding set of patches on the ML. though the lack of feedback wrt sunxi-tools is frustrating...

If they just made a simple USB one, but USB recivers are expensive.

you know where to get one mini amp cheap for future reference?

<KotCzarny>
and your local auctioning sites

[16:55](#16313126)

With that said, the reason it's low is because there is no amp

[16:55](#16313127)

or yea

they are pretty popular and cheap

I took theirs as it was cheapest

[17:17](#16313327)

dont know, i'm using some frankencable made from ripped of connector and hdd enclosure power brick

[17:17](#16313331)

\*off

[17:17](#16313338)
<Rambler454>
sounds safe

[17:17](#16313347)
<KotCzarny>
not using any enclosure for the board isnt quite safe neither

[17:18](#16313357)
<oneinsect>
interesting the nanopim1 takes power from the debug header

[17:18](#16313358)
<oneinsect>
5v

[17:18](#16313360)
<oneinsect>
kinda strange

[17:19](#16313363)
<KotCzarny>
many boards have direct connection from dc-in to 40pin 5v

[17:19](#16313364)
<oneinsect>
they said when both microusb and the header get 5v...the one with the highest output voltage get preference

[17:19](#16313365)
<oneinsect>
and stays there

[17:19](#16313367)

I just added a sane alsa config for Pine64 to <https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image/blob/master/blobs/asound.state> - anyone can explain to me why the codec driver has 113 controls?

[18:52](#16314215)
<KotCzarny>
because why not?

[18:52](#16314223)
<longsleep>
yeah

[18:52](#16314229)
<KotCzarny>
do they even work?

[18:53](#16314241)
<longsleep>
yes - the ones which are wired on the board work good. means 5 out of 113

[18:53](#16314243)
<KotCzarny>
that's what i asked about ;)

[18:54](#16314246)
<KotCzarny>
maybe the driver was some catch-all

[18:54](#16314247)
<longsleep>
it certainly seems like that

[18:54](#16314249)
<KotCzarny>
whole thing must look hilarious in alsamixer

[18:55](#16314256)
<longsleep>
its essentially unusable - but i guess with a sane sate noone ever has to open up alsamixer again

[18:56](#16314261)
<longsleep>
but the analog audio is pretty good, no noise and very clear

[18:56](#16314266)

its actually usable for audio playback

[19:16](#16314391)

funny piece of code

[19:19](#16314407)

so they have a procfs file to become root?

[19:19](#16314414)

[19:21](#16314428)
<longsleep>
well at least the file is not there

[19:22](#16314429)
<KotCzarny>
it's probably some android fallout

[19:22](#16314434)
<longsleep>
well do you have a system running this kernel?

[19:22](#16314435)
<longsleep>
check for /proc/sunxi\_debug

[19:23](#16314441)
<longsleep>
echo "rootmydevice" > /proc/sunxi\_debug as normal user could be interesting

[19:23](#16314442)
<KotCzarny>
yes, its the kernel im running

[19:23](#16314443)
<KotCzarny>
3.4.39

[19:23](#16314444)
<KotCzarny>
sunxi\_debug is a dir

[19:24](#16314447)

;)

[19:26](#16314466)
<KotCzarny>
i guess its useful for android, but for normal linux it's .. well ..

[19:26](#16314472)
<longsleep>
even for android - every installed app can become root on such a system

[19:27](#16314473)
<KotCzarny>
;)

in short, all allwinner boxes are rooted ;)

no, not rooted - they have no protection at all from anything

that driver you linked creates it with 0666 permission

[19:30](#16314514)
<KotCzarny>
i wonder if there are other such 'ingenious' pieces of code

[19:31](#16314515)
<longsleep>
if these kernels are in use in the wild, it is certainly worth a CVE

[19:31](#16314519)
<KotCzarny>
not really

[19:31](#16314520)
<KotCzarny>
using old kernel is a security hole itself

[19:32](#16314523)
<longsleep>
sure, but that just breaks everything

[19:33](#16314528)

its not even an exploit, it is kernel provided 'su' for everyone

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.
