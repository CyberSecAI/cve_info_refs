| Would it make more sense to continue setting a default LHS, erroring out if we can't read an RHS and also don't find one in the environment? Setting HES\_DOMAIN during the tests should be enough for them. |

| Okay, switching back to setting a default LHS if we fail to read the configuration file, and erroring out later if there isn't an acceptable RHS value set in the environment, and making sure that HES\_DOMAIN is set to "athena.mit.edu" when we run hestest, seems to work. |

It's copied from read\_config\_file(), though I have no idea why read\_config\_file() uses that particular error code. Would ENOENT make more sense?

EINVAL or ENOENT make more sense

Okay, I'm leaning toward EINVAL because at that point we may well have managed to read a configuration file, so ENOENT could be confusing.

| Hmm, the more I think about this, the more I'm leaning toward going back to just returning an error when we fail to open the file, and setting HESIOD\_CONFIG to point to the in-tree hesiod.conf.sample file when we run *hestest*. That seems to be enough for it here. Opinions? |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1332493#c0)  Adam Mari≈°    2016-05-03 10:48:51 UTC  ``` It was reported that hesiod uses hard-coded default domain name allowing the attacker, that can control the athena.mit.edu zone or one of its parent zones or able to pose as MITM, to supply fake Hesiod data in certain cases, allowing injection of fake root accounts. If Hesiod deployment uses DNSSEC with a trusted, validating recursive resolver to secure Hesiod data, it can result into retrieval of non-DNSSEC-signed Hesiod data, since athena.mit.edu is currently unsigned.  Vulnerable code:  #define DEF_RHS ".athena.mit.edu" ... /* Try to open the configuration file. */ fp = fopen(filename, "r"); if (!fp) { /* Use compiled in default domain names. */ ctx->lhs = malloc(strlen(DEF_LHS) + 1); ctx->rhs = malloc(strlen(DEF_RHS) + 1);   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1332493#c1)  Adam Mari≈°    2016-05-03 10:49:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Florian Weimer (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1332493#c2)  Adam Mari≈°    2016-05-03 10:49:14 UTC  ```  Created hesiod tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332494](show_bug.cgi?id=1332494 "CLOSED ERRATA - hesiod: Use of hard-coded unsafe configuration if configuration file cannot be opened [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1332493#c3)  Florian Weimer    2016-05-03 11:28:20 UTC  ``` glibc is not affected by this issue.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: two flaws in hesiod permitting privilege elevation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> [] Weak SUID check allowing privilege elevation
>
> Hesiod unsafely checks EUID vs UID in a few places, consulting
> environment variables for configuration if they match. This could be
> used for privilege elevation under some circumstances. The fix uses
> secure_getenv() in place of getenv().
>
> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1332508>
> <https://github.com/achernya/hesiod/pull/9>

Use CVE-2016-10151.

> [] Use of hard-coded DNS domain if configuration file cannot be read
>
> If opening the configuration file fails, hesiod falls back on a default
> domain ".athena.mit.edu" to retrieve managed information. A local
> attacker with the opportunity to poison DNS cache could potentially
> elevate their privileges to root by causing fopen() to fail.
>
> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1332493>
> <https://github.com/achernya/hesiod/pull/10>

Use CVE-2016-10152.
