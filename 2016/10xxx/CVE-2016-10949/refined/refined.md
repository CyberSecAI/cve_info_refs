The provided content describes a vulnerability in Relevanssi Premium, which is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in an admin-side search function of Relevanssi Premium. This function is not visible in the user interface but is present in the code and can be accessed.
- The SQL injection allows user-controlled values to be passed into an unserialization call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw.
- **Unserialization Vulnerability:** The SQL injection is exploited to pass user-controlled input into PHP's `unserialize()` function. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if suitable classes with methods like `__destruct` are available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If exploitable classes are available, the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact, with complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Admin User Interaction:** An attacker can trick a logged-in admin user into visiting a malicious website. The malicious website uses JavaScript to send a crafted request to the vulnerable Relevanssi Premium installation.
- **Direct Exploitation with Admin Privileges:** An attacker with admin privileges can directly exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft SQL injection payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads to control data passed to `unserialize()`.
- **Ability to host a malicious website or access to an admin account:** The attacker needs a way to make an admin user send the malicious request or already have administrative access to the site.
- **Knowledge of potentially exploitable classes:** The attacker needs to understand what classes are available on the system and which might contain methods that will be executed when they are unserialized.

**Additional Information:**

- The advisory notes that arbitrary code execution is not guaranteed in all cases and depends on the presence of specific classes within the system.
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2016-10-07 and patched on 2016-11-02 in version 1.14.6.1 of the plugin.
