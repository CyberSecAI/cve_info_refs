Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-10287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm sound driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel.
- This is an elevation of privilege issue, meaning an attacker can gain access to capabilities they shouldn't normally have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
- This could result in a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing the operating system to repair the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. A malicious application installed on the device would be required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
- No specific user interaction is mentioned, so the app might run with minimal permissions to trigger this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically in the Qualcomm sound driver.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in the Android security patch level of 2017-05-05.
- The specific commit addressing the issue in the Qualcomm kernel is provided: [QC-CR#1112751](https://www.codeaurora.org/gitweb/quic/la/?p=kernel/msm-4.4.git;a=commit;h=937bc9e644180e258c68662095861803f7ba4ded).
