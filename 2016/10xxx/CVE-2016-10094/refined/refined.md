Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs in the `_TIFFmemcpy` function within the `libtiff` library.
- Specifically, the issue arises in the `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile()` function of the `tiff2pdf` tool, where an incorrect size calculation leads to an out-of-bounds write during the copy operation. This is related to handling of JPEGTables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow caused by incorrect size handling during a memory copy operation.
- **Off-by-one error:** The commit message indicates an "off-by-one error", suggesting that the size of the copy is one or two bytes larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution by corrupting memory via an out-of-bounds write.
- **Denial of service:** A less severe impact can be a crash, which would result in a denial of service.
- **Memory corruption:** The overflow can corrupt heap memory, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted TIFF file:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted TIFF file using the `tiff2pdf` tool. The crafted TIFF file contains specific data, likely in the JPEGTables, that triggers the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a crafted TIFF file:** An attacker would need the ability to provide a malicious TIFF file to be processed by a vulnerable `libtiff` version using `tiff2pdf` tool.
- **User Interaction:** The victim would need to open/process the crafted tiff file using a vulnerable version of `tiff2pdf`.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile()` function in `tools/tiff2pdf.c`.
- The vulnerability is located in `tif_unix.c` file, line 340 during call to `_TIFFmemcpy`.
- The commit `c7153361a4041260719b340f73f2f76b0969235c` fixes the issue by correcting the size calculation for JPEGTables.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop.
- The bug was reported by Agostino Sarubbo.
- The fix involves preventing the overflow during the `_TIFFmemcpy` call within the context of `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile()` when processing JPEGTables.

The provided information gives a clear picture of a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libtiff, specifically when using the tiff2pdf tool, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The fix commit and bug report are included in the analysis.
