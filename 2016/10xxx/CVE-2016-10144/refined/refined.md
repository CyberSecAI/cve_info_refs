{
  "CVE-2016-10144": {
    "Description": "The  vulnerability is a missing malloc check in the ipl file handling within ImageMagick.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper error checking after a memory allocation operation. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if `malloc` was successful in allocating memory before proceeding to use the allocated memory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing malloc check in coders/ipl.c can result in a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "If `malloc` fails, the program will likely crash due to a NULL pointer dereference when it tries to use the unallocated memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted IPL image file that leads to allocation failure.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to provide a malformed IPL image file that causes memory allocation to fail when processed by ImageMagick."
