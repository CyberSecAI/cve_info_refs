## 4. MITIGATIONS

Schneider Electric recommends that users of affected Citect and PlantStruxure products download and install the new version of the software located at:

<https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/documents/downloads/Floating_License_Manager_v2.1.0.0.zip>

Users using EcoStruxure Modicon Builder V3.0 are recommended to download and use the new version (V3.1) located at:

<https://partner.schneider-electric.com/partners/Menu/MyPartnership> (login required)

StructureWare 7.2.x users should upgrade to Version 7.2.2 and apply the floating licensing manager (FLM) patch from the following location:

<https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/n2fh1ym594pqvl87kf0zjsigamuryrje>

EcoStruxure/StruxureWare Power Monitoring Expert and Power SCADA Operations users need to upgrade to Version 8.2. Energy Expert users need to upgrade to Version 1.3. Once these are upgraded apply the Cumulative Update (CU) 2 located at:

<https://schneider-electric.box.com/s/kkdikodcksjj1dznqy68ko0j28wct7vb>

Schneider Electric has also released security notifications which contain further details and upgrade instructions at the following links:

<https://www.citect.schneider-electric.com/safety-and-security-central/36-security-notifications/9134-vulnerabilities-within-schneider-electric-floating-license-manager>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-137-01/>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-144-01/>

<https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2018-046-01/>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
