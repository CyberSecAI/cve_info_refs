Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2016-10095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `_TIFFVGetField` function within the `tif_dir.c` file of the libtiff library. This occurs when processing a crafted TIFF file, specifically when setting the Predictor tag on an uncompressed file. The vulnerability is triggered due to improper handling of codec-specific tags during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `_TIFFVGetField` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of proper input validation: The code doesn't adequately validate if a tag is valid for the current compression scheme or if the codec is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The stack buffer overflow can lead to program termination, causing a denial of service.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow has the potential for attackers to overwrite data on the stack, potentially gaining control of the program and executing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TIFF file: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file that triggers the buffer overflow in the `_TIFFVGetField` function.
- File Processing: The vulnerability can be exploited when a vulnerable application (e.g. `tiffsplit`, `tiffcmp`, `thumbnail`) processes the malicious TIFF file, leading to a crash or potential code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted TIFF file: The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious TIFF file to a user or application which then processes the file using the vulnerable libtiff library.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to other `_TIFFVGetField` issues like CVE-2015-7554 and CVE-2016-5318, suggesting a common root cause in how libtiff handles tags and codecs.
- The fix involves introducing a `_TIFFCheckFieldIsValidForCodec` function, which filters out tags that are not applicable to the current compression scheme, preventing the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability affects libtiff version 4.0.7 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)
- The fix was backported to older versions of Debian.
