Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10114 (Note: While the exploit-db entry mentions "CVE: REQUESTED," the Joomla VEL entry confirms it as CVE-2016-10114 )

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-supplied input within the `aweb_cartwatching_system` and `aweb_cart_autosave` components of the Joomla extension. Specifically, the `view` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (Blind Time-Based):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `view` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries. The vulnerability is blind time-based, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of their query, but they can infer information by observing delays introduced by the `SLEEP()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access the entire database of the Joomla application, potentially retrieving sensitive data such as user credentials, personal information, and other confidential details.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Further Attacks:** The attacker could use the compromised database to escalate their attack, gaining further control of the system or network, depending on the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Parameters:** The attack vector is through the `view` parameter within a HTTP GET/POST request to the vulnerable application.
- **Specific URL:** The vulnerable component is accessed through the URL structure:
  `index.php?option=com_virtuemart&view=categorysearch...`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the vulnerable Joomla installation.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `view`.
- The attacker uses `RLIKE` and `SLEEP()` function for time-based blind SQL injection.
- Example payload from the provided content: `option=com_virtuemart&view=categorysearch' RLIKE (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))sgjA) AND 'jHwz'='jHwz&task=smartSearch`

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerable software is `aweb-cartwatching-system` versions 2.6.0 and earlier for Joomla's Virtuemart extension.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later of the extension.
- The vulnerability was reported to the Joomla Vulnerability Extensions List (VEL).
