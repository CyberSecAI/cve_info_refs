### Bug Description

This vulnerability is almost same as CVE-2015-0854. If you click "Run a plugin" option while viewing a file with a specially-crafted filename allows arbitrary code execution with the permissions

of the user running Shutter.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

   1) Rename an image to something like "$(firefox)"

   2) Open the renamed file in shutter

   3) Click the "Run a plugin" option and select any plugin from the list and click "Run"

You should see firefox browser opened as separate process.

In line 7571-7572:/usr/bin/shutter

$session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} = $session\_screens{$key}->{'short'};

  $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} =~ s/.\*\.//ig;

if the file doesn't any have extension, $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} simply returns the actual filename instead of "undef".

In line 7163:/usr/bin/shutter

exec( sprintf( "$^X $plugin\_value %d $qfilename $session\_screens{$key}->{'width'} $session\_screens{$key}->{'height'} $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'}\n", $socket->get\_id ) );

by passing unescaped shell characters "$session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'}" to exec function, it directly gets executed as current running user.

# Exploit Title: Shutter user-assisted remote code execution
# Date: 2016-12-26
# Software Link: http://shutter-project.org/
# Version: 0.93.1
# Tested on: Ubuntu,  Debian
# Exploit Author: Prajith P
# Website: http://prajith.in/
# Author Mail: me@prajith.in
# CVE: CVE-2016-10081

1. Description.
   /usr/bin/shutter in Shutter through 0.93.1 allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted image name that is
mishandled during a "Run a plugin" action.

2. Proof of concept.
   1) Rename an image to something like "$(firefox)"
   2) Open the renamed file in shutter
   3) Click the "Run a plugin" option and select any plugin from the list and click "Run"

3. Solution:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/shutter/+bug/1652600

Thanks,
Prajithh

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1409785#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-03 11:21:47 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of Fedora.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.  [bug automatically created by: add-tracking-bugs]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1409785#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-03 11:21:53 UTC  ```  Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1409784,1409785  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [CVE-2016-10081](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10081)  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1409785#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2017-11-16 19:08:23 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 25 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '25'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 25 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1409785#c3)  Jan Kurik    2018-05-31 07:30:48 UTC  ``` This bug has been reported against a Fedora version which is already unsuported. In compliance with FESCo decision how to handle EOL of Security issues [1], I am changing the version to '27', the latest supported release.  Please check whether this bug is still an issue on the '27' release. If you find this bug not being applicable on this release, please close it.  [1] <https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1736>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1409785#c4)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 15:32:00 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.

### Bug Description

This vulnerability is almost same as CVE-2015-0854. If you click "Run a plugin" option while viewing a file with a specially-crafted filename allows arbitrary code execution with the permissions

of the user running Shutter.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

   1) Rename an image to something like "$(firefox)"

   2) Open the renamed file in shutter

   3) Click the "Run a plugin" option and select any plugin from the list and click "Run"

You should see firefox browser opened as separate process.

In line 7571-7572:/usr/bin/shutter

$session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} = $session\_screens{$key}->{'short'};

  $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} =~ s/.\*\.//ig;

if the file doesn't any have extension, $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'} simply returns the actual filename instead of "undef".

In line 7163:/usr/bin/shutter

exec( sprintf( "$^X $plugin\_value %d $qfilename $session\_screens{$key}->{'width'} $session\_screens{$key}->{'height'} $session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'}\n", $socket->get\_id ) );

by passing unescaped shell characters "$session\_screens{$key}->{'filetype'}" to exec function, it directly gets executed as current running user.
