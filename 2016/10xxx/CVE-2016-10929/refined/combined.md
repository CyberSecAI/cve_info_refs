### [Works great](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-4313/)

Thanks! Plugin works. I’ve combined it with “Ajax Pagination and Infinite Scroll” by Malinky, and this works!
One question: is there plans to support admin bar? I mean that if you open post there is no edit link in admin bar.

In many cases the extensions remove widget from the sidebar to put them in the main div content

This doesn’t work as it should and as it has been documented and there is no documentation or support.
Waste of time and effort

Works like a charm. Easy to install and incorporate.

### [Useful and reliable](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/useful-and-reliable-3/)

Very good work.
Offers very useful options for callbacks (reload code, click code, ajax load code).
Works out of the box in most cases.
Just had a big problem to make a plugin that relies on ajax json config work with AAPL (ajax call of the plugin worked only when the user is loggedin). Problem and resolution, that may be useful for other users of AAPL, is here : https://wordpress.org/support/topic/unable-to-use-wp-admin-for-non-admin-users/#post-8367119
