Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10063:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `tiff.c` file of ImageMagick. This occurs during the processing of TIFF image files. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a missing or insufficient check on the image dimensions (width and height) when processing a TIFF image, leading to an attempt to allocate a buffer with insufficient size.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacked proper validation of the image dimensions read from the TIFF file. This failure to validate the width and height allowed for the creation of an image buffer that was too small to accommodate the actual image data leading to a buffer overflow.
    *   **Memory Management Error:**  The vulnerability is triggered by the `SetImageExtent` function, which should be allocating the necessary memory to hold the image. The insufficient check on image dimensions leads to incorrect calculations of memory allocation and subsequent buffer overflows.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The most likely impact is a crash of the application due to the buffer overflow.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, buffer overflows can sometimes be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, but this would be more complex and dependent on the specific memory layout and exploit.
    *   **Unspecified impact:** According to the bug report a maliciously crafted file could cause unspecified impact.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted TIFF image file.
    *   An attacker would need to supply a malicious TIFF file to a vulnerable application using ImageMagick for image processing.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted TIFF file to a system using a vulnerable version of ImageMagick for processing images.
    *   This can be through user upload of a malicious image, processing of an attacker-supplied file, or any other scenario that makes ImageMagick process a malicious image.

**Additional details:**

* The fix involves a more robust check for buffer overflows during TIFF file handling and the use of the `SetImageExtent` function with proper exception handling.
* The vulnerability was addressed in the following upstream commit: `2bb6941a2d557f26a2f2049ade466e118eeaab91`.
* The fix was included in ImageMagick version 6.9.5
* This vulnerability was reported via Debian bug tracker.

**Summary of changes (from commit diffs):**
* The commit `2bb6941` modified `coders/tiff.c` to remove exception handling from the image extent setting function call in two places, meaning that if SetImageExtent returned false, it would terminate processing. The previous behavior would not properly check the returned status, leading to further processing of the corrupt image and leading to a crash or other unspecified impact.
* The commit `94936ef` modified `coders/tiff.c` to include exception handling in the `SetImageExtent` call. This allowed for more descriptive error messages rather than just aborting when `SetImageExtent` failed.
