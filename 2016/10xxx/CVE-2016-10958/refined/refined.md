Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `es_prop_media_images()` function in the Estatik WordPress plugin, which is intended for handling media uploads by logged-in administrators. However, this function was made accessible through WordPress AJAX functionality to unauthenticated users due to the use of `wp_ajax_nopriv_es_prop_media_images`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The core issue is the ability for any user (even those not logged in) to upload files to the server through the `es_prop_media_images()` function.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The plugin fails to restrict access to the file upload functionality, which should only be available to authenticated administrators.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The code uses `move_uploaded_file()` without adequate validation and sanitization of the uploaded file name, which could lead to arbitrary file upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, executables) to the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and then accessing a malicious PHP script, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking over the entire website or server.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could upload files that modify the content of the website, leading to defacement.
*   **Data Theft/Loss:** Successful RCE can enable the attacker to steal sensitive data or cause data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the action set to `es_prop_media_images` and including the file to be uploaded in the `es_media_images` array.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone, even unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress website.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to craft an HTTP POST request, or use an existing tool to do it. No elevated privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by pluginvulnerabilities.com and was confirmed by Estatik.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the Estatik plugin prior to version 2.3.0.
*   The Estatik team released a security update (version 2.3.0) to address the vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions that version 2.3.0 fixed the primary arbitrary file upload vulnerability but introduced a lesser authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability which is tracked in a separate advisory.
