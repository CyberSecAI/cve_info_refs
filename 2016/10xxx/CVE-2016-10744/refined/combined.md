### @snipe **[snipe](/snipe)** commented [Mar 19, 2019](#issue-422531443)

This fixes a few places where data was not being escaped in the API, and also handles what appears to be a bug in Select2 (that was first reported in 2016, but has not been addressed).

Because we use rich menus (images, etc) in our dropdowns, we use the HTML template feature of Select2. While the data we send to Select2 was properly escaped, a bug in Select2 takes that escaped data and parses the HTML in the DOM when the "selected" method fires.

This vulnerability in Select2 is likely reproducible in any implementation of Select2 where the application is using remote data loading via ajax and also using HTML templates to display the listbox data. We've mitigated it in our specific implementation, and have reached out to Select2 to see if there's been any progress on patching the Select2 library itself.

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

[![@Je1te](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3314346?v=4&size=48)](/Je1te)[Je1te](https://github.com/Je1te)opened [on Sep 15, 2016](https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/4587#issue-177178224)

Under "Loading remote data", the data that is retrieved remotely is not sanitized before displaying it, and this should be done to prevent XSS issues. For example, when I enter *je1* in the input field, one of the retrieved GitHub repo's data contains malicious JS code that is executed and that simulates a fake PayPal page which asks for your credit card info (seems like phishing).
