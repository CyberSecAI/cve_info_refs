RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Debian Bug     : 865303 865416

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10208

    Sergej Schumilo and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that a crafted ext4
    filesystem could trigger memory corruption when it is mounted.  A
    user that can provide a device or filesystem image to be mounted
    could use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-8824

    Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false

CVE-2017-8831

    Pengfei Wang discovered that the saa7164 video capture driver
    re-reads data from a PCI device after validating it.  A physically
    present user able to attach a specially designed PCI device could
    use this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-12190

    Vitaly Mayatskikh discovered that the block layer did not
    correctly count page references for raw I/O from user-space.  This
    can be exploited by a guest VM with access to a host SCSI device
    for denial of service (memory exhaustion) or potentially for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13080

    A vulnerability was found in the WPA2 protocol that could lead to
    reinstallation of the same Group Temporal Key (GTK), which
    substantially reduces the security of wifi encryption.  This is
    one of the issues collectively known as "KRACK".

    Updates to GTKs are usually handled by the wpa package, where this
    issue was already fixed (DLA-1150-1).  However, some wifi devices
    can remain active and update GTKs autonomously while the system is
    suspended.  The kernel must also check for and ignore key
    reinstallation.

CVE-2017-14051

    "shqking" reported that the qla2xxx SCSI host driver did not
    correctly validate I/O to the "optrom" sysfs attribute of the
    devices it creates.  This is unlikely to have any security
    impact.

CVE-2017-15115

    Vladis Dronov reported that the SCTP implementation did not
    correctly handle "peel-off" of an association to another net
    namespace.  This leads to a use-after-free, which a local user can
    exploit for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already
    have the sctp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling
    it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-sctp.conf install sctp false

CVE-2017-15265

    Michael23 Yu reported a race condition in the ALSA sequencer
    subsystem involving creation and deletion of ports, which could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with access to an ALSA
    sequencer device can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    loss) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15299

    Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem did not correctly
    handle update of an uninstantiated key, leading to a null
    dereference.  A local user can use this for denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-15649

    "nixioaming" reported a race condition in the packet socket
    (AF_PACKET) implementation involving rebinding to a fanout group,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with the
    CAP_NET_RAW capability can use this for denial of service (crash
    or data corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-15868

    Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16525

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB serial console
    implementation did not correctly handle disconnection of unusual
    serial devices, leading to a use-after-free.  A similar issue was
    found in the case where setup of a serial console fails.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or data corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16527

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound mixer driver did not
    correctly cancel I/O in case it failed to probe a device, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  A physically present user with a
    specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or data corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2017-16529

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB sound driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16531

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate IAD
    lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device may be able to
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16532

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB test driver did not
    correctly handle devices with specific combinations of endpoints.
    A physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16533

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB HID driver did not fully
    validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16535

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the USB core did not validate BOS
    descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer over-read.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device may
    be able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2017-16536

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the cx231xx video capture driver
    did not fully validate the device endpoint configuration, which
    could lead to a null dereference.  A physically present user with
    a specially designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2017-16537

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the imon RC driver did not fully
    validate the device interface configuration, which could lead to a
    null dereference.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16643

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the gtco tablet driver did not
    fully validate descriptor lengths, which could lead to a buffer
    over-read.  A physically present user with a specially designed
    USB device may be able to use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16649

    Bjørn Mork found that the cdc_ether network driver did not
    validate the device's maximum segment size, potentially leading to
    a division by zero.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2017-16939

    Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-1000407

    Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.96-2.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.96.  It also fixes some regressions caused by
the fix for CVE-2017-1000364, which was included in DLA-993-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-11-29 15:43:27 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of seq_file where an local attacker could create a situation in which an attacker could manipulate memory in which the function pointer to put() could be used for malicious purposes. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privledged escalation.  There are no exploits available for this flaw at this time.  Upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=77da160530dd1dc94f6ae15a981f24e5f0021e84>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c7)  Vladis Dronov    2017-02-09 13:26:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the code which can trigger the flaw is not present in the products listed.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and MRG-2. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases might address this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-04-11 11:48:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2017:0892 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0892](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A0892)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:31:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:1297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1297)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:41:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1298 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1298](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1298)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1399727#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 15:39:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1308 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1308](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1308)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1395190#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-11-15 11:39:14 UTC  ``` Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to a memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Reads (according to KASAN). Automounting a disk image either as USB or loopback is not configured by default on servers but is enabled on desktop environments.  Attackers with a remote connection will likely be unable to trigger this vulnerability on the commandline. Instead the automatic mounting feature of the GUI via a crafted USB-device is required.  The system will likely panic with a page fault, but attackers may be able to map another page in the correct location and be able to overwrite or corrupt memory possibly leading to privilege escalation.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1298)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the packet\_set\_ring() function of the Linux kernel's networking implementation did not properly validate certain block-size data. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_RAW capability could use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the crash of the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2017-7308, Important)
* Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to an attacker controlled memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds reads. (CVE-2016-10208, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq\_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation. (CVE-2016-7910, Moderate)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could trigger oops in shash\_async\_export() by attempting to force the in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set. (CVE-2016-8646, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo kernel team) for reporting CVE-2016-8646.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-514.21.1 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1440803)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1297)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the packet\_set\_ring() function of the Linux kernel's networking implementation did not properly validate certain block-size data. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_RAW capability could use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the crash of the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2017-7308, Important)
* Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to an attacker controlled memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds reads. (CVE-2016-10208, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq\_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation. (CVE-2016-7910, Moderate)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could trigger oops in shash\_async\_export() by attempting to force the in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set. (CVE-2016-8646, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo kernel team) for reporting CVE-2016-8646.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-514 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1440807)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

ext4: validate s\_first\_meta\_bg at mount timeRalf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
calculating fs overhead (ext4\_calculate\_overhead()), this is because
the image has very large s\_first\_meta\_bg (debug code shows it's
842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count\_overhead() when
setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE\_SIZE.
ext4\_calculate\_overhead():
buf = get\_zeroed\_page(GFP\_NOFS); <=== PAGE\_SIZE buffer
blks = count\_overhead(sb, i, buf);
count\_overhead():
for (j = ext4\_bg\_num\_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
ext4\_set\_bit(EXT4\_B2C(sbi, s++), buf); <=== buffer overrun
count++;
}
This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:
#!/bin/bash
rm -f fs.img
mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
fallocate -l 16M fs.img
mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta\_bg,^resize\_inode -F fs.img
debugfs -w -R "ssv first\_meta\_bg 842150400" fs.img
mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4
Fix it by validating s\_first\_meta\_bg first at mount time, and
refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta\_bg
number.

OS-S Security Advisory 2016-22
Local DoS: Linux Kernel EXT4 Memory Corruption / SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Read

Date:
October 31th, 2016
Authors:
Sergej Schumilo, Ralf Spenneberg
CVE:
Not yet assigned
CVSS:
4.9 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
Severity:
Critical
Ease of Exploitation:
Trivial
Vulnerability Type:
Memory Corruption / SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Read

Abstract:
Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to a memory corruption and
SLAB-Out-of-Bounds Reads (according to KASAN).
Since the mounting procedure is a privileged operation, an attacker is
probably not able to trigger this vulnerability on the commandline.
Instead the automatic mounting feature of the GUI via a crafted
USB-device is required.

Detailed product description:
We have verified the bug on the following kernel builds:
 Ubuntu Server 16.10 (GNU/Linux 4.8.0-22-generic x86_64)
 RedHat Kernel 3.10.0-327.18.2.el7.x86_64

Vendor Communication:
We contacted RedHat on May, 03th 2016.
To this day, no security patch was provided by the vendor.
We publish this Security Advisory in accordance with our responsible
disclosure policy.

Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1332503>

Proof of Concept:
As a proof of concept, we are providing the image that is causing the
memory corruption / use-after-free. For demonstration purposes a script
to mount this filesystem is also attached.

Severity and Ease of Exploitation:
The vulnerability can be easily exploited as a Denial-of-Service
remotely by using a USB-device. In this case the attacker must copy this
image (e.g. using dd) to a device or storage such as a SD-card which can
be set to read-only mode (using the write-protection switch).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A1308)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the packet\_set\_ring() function of the Linux kernel's networking implementation did not properly validate certain block-size data. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_RAW capability could use this flaw to trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the crash of the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out. (CVE-2017-7308, Important)
* Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only leads to an attacker controlled memory corruption and SLAB-Out-of-Bounds reads. (CVE-2016-10208, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of seq\_file where a local attacker could manipulate memory in the put() function pointer. This could lead to memory corruption and possible privileged escalation. (CVE-2016-7910, Moderate)
* A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could trigger oops in shash\_async\_export() by attempting to force the in-kernel hashing algorithms into decrypting an empty data set. (CVE-2016-8646, Moderate)
* It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version v4.10-rc8, an application may trigger a BUG\_ON in sctp\_wait\_for\_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is waiting on it to queue more data, and meanwhile another thread peels off the association being used by the first thread. (CVE-2017-5986, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Igor Redko (Virtuozzo kernel team) for reporting CVE-2016-8646.

Additional Changes:

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements. Documentation for these changes is available from the Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

ext4: validate s\_first\_meta\_bg at mount timeRalf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
calculating fs overhead (ext4\_calculate\_overhead()), this is because
the image has very large s\_first\_meta\_bg (debug code shows it's
842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count\_overhead() when
setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE\_SIZE.
ext4\_calculate\_overhead():
buf = get\_zeroed\_page(GFP\_NOFS); <=== PAGE\_SIZE buffer
blks = count\_overhead(sb, i, buf);
count\_overhead():
for (j = ext4\_bg\_num\_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
ext4\_set\_bit(EXT4\_B2C(sbi, s++), buf); <=== buffer overrun
count++;
}
This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:
#!/bin/bash
rm -f fs.img
mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
fallocate -l 16M fs.img
mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta\_bg,^resize\_inode -F fs.img
debugfs -w -R "ssv first\_meta\_bg 842150400" fs.img
mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4
Fix it by validating s\_first\_meta\_bg first at mount time, and
refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta\_bg
number.

In a default or common use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 this issue does not allow an unprivileged local user elevate their privileges on the system. In order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_RAW capability, which needs to be granted by the administrator to the attacker's account. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not have namespaces support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces feature to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.  So, this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 in the default configuration. Future updates for the respective releases will address this issue to secure non-default configurations.  In the non-default configuration mentioned above only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is vulnerable only to a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash, hence the impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is rated as being Moderate.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c9)  Martin Prpič    2017-05-11 07:09:15 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/05/exploiting-linux-kernel-via-packet.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:31:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2017:1297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1297)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 13:42:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1298 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1298](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1298)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-05-25 15:46:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2017:1308 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1308](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A1308)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1437404#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-19 04:48:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:1854 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1854](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1854)   ``` |  |

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

ext4: validate s\_first\_meta\_bg at mount time

Ralf Spenneberg reported that he hit a kernel crash when mounting a
modified ext4 image. And it turns out that kernel crashed when
calculating fs overhead (ext4_calculate_overhead()), this is because
the image has very large s_first_meta_bg (debug code shows it's
842150400), and ext4 overruns the memory in count_overhead() when
setting bitmap buffer, which is PAGE_SIZE.

ext4_calculate_overhead():
  buf = get_zeroed_page(GFP_NOFS);  <=== PAGE_SIZE buffer
  blks = count_overhead(sb, i, buf);

count_overhead():
  for (j = ext4_bg_num_gdb(sb, grp); j > 0; j--) { <=== j = 842150400
          ext4_set_bit(EXT4_B2C(sbi, s++), buf);   <=== buffer overrun
          count++;
  }

This can be reproduced easily for me by this script:

  #!/bin/bash
  rm -f fs.img
  mkdir -p /mnt/ext4
  fallocate -l 16M fs.img
  mke2fs -t ext4 -O bigalloc,meta_bg,^resize_inode -F fs.img
  debugfs -w -R "ssv first_meta_bg 842150400" fs.img
  mount -o loop fs.img /mnt/ext4

Fix it by validating s_first_meta_bg first at mount time, and
refusing to mount if its value exceeds the largest possible meta_bg
number.
