{
  "CVE-2016-10208": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem implementation does not properly validate the s_first_meta_bg value at mount time.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "SLAB out-of-bounds read",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially achieve privilege escalation by mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only. The system may panic with a page fault, but attackers might be able to overwrite or corrupt memory potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted EXT4 image read-only, likely through automated GUI mounting features (USB devices)",
      "Automounting a disk image either as USB or loopback"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with physical access can exploit the vulnerability with a specially designed USB or SD card. Attackers with a remote connection will likely be unable to trigger this vulnerability on the command line."
