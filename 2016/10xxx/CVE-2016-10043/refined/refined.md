{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `MSM_MACRO_NAME` POST parameter, before using it in a system call.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server, potentially leading to: compromising the application's data and functionality, compromising the web server, using the server as a platform for attacks against other systems.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to the `/swms/ms.cgi` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `MSM_MACRO_NAME` parameter with shell metacharacters like `|`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have a valid session."
