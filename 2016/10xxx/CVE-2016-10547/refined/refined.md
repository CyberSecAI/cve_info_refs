Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Nunjucks template engine, when `autoescape` is enabled, only performs escaping on string types. If a variable passed to the template is an array, the escaping is skipped. This is due to an explicit type check in the `suppressValue` function within the Nunjucks runtime, which can be found at https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/blob/master/src/runtime.js#L209.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Type Mismatch:** Nunjucks' `autoescape` feature is bypassed when template variables are arrays. The code does not handle the case where a value is not a string and simply passes it on without escaping.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** The behavior is inconsistent, as regular string variables are correctly escaped while array variables are not, leading to potential confusion and security vulnerabilities.
- **Data Type Coercion:**  Libraries like "qs" used by Express to parse query parameters allow for array notation in query parameters (e.g., `?name[]=value`), which means an attacker can easily provide input as an array, bypassing the escaping mechanism in Nunjucks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the rendered page by manipulating the query parameters or other inputs to become arrays. This enables them to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated Query Parameters:** By using array notation (`[]`) in query parameters, attackers can force the input to be an array, thus bypassing Nunjucks' autoescaping. The vulnerable URL would look like `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?name[]=<s>matt</s>` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?name[]=<script>alert(1)</script>`.
- **Manipulated Body Data:** Similarly, if the application uses `body-parser` to parse request bodies and passes these to templates, the same vulnerability exists. Input can be provided as an array in request body, also bypassing the escaping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Influence Input:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate input passed to the Nunjucks template, either through query parameters or via request body. 
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges, access, or special position.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided GitHub issue ([https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/issues/835](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/issues/835)) documents this vulnerability.
- A sample application demonstrating the vulnerability is available at [https://github.com/matt-/nunjucks_test](https://github.com/matt-/nunjucks_test).
- The vulnerability is triggered by the explicit type check `typeof val === 'string'` in the `suppressValue` function, which skips escaping when `val` is not a string.
