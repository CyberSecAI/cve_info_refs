## **Adirondack Staging Repository (Version 1.0.0)**

We are pleased to announce a new masternode coin with a real future!

Adirondack is the nickname for Mars Exploration Rover Spirit’s first target stone.

It is also the name of the first ever masternode coin with a real use;
for the advancement of space exploration!

There are thousands of other planets out there! We have eight planets in our Solar System. However, outside of our Solar System there are thousands of other planets. The extra-solar planets or exo-planets are in orbit around another star. So far, we have almost 1,800 confirmed new worlds, with another 3,000 awaiting confirmation. Astronomers are looking to a star’s goldilocks zone for planets that may be habitable, just like the Earth.

# Alert Key and Alert System Vulnerabilities Disclosure

The bitcoin alert keys are disclosed in this blog post, followed by a description of the purpose of this information and its history. The bitcoin alert system has been completely retired. The network is not at risk and this warning may be safely ignored if you do not have an ancient node (running v0.12.x or older) using the deprecated bitcoin alert system or its public keys.

```

These are openssl-serialized private keys.

In 2016, a plan was [proposed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-September/013104.html) for the completion of the retirement of the bitcoin alert system which included the idea of revealing the alert system private keys. The proposal still contains good information regarding the purpose and intention of alert system retirement and motivation for the disclosure of the private keys. Additionally, an overview of the alert system retirement and its timeline is available [on the web](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement). This disclosure was recently discussed in an [IRC meeting logs](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-06-21-19.00.log.html#l-30). A media site also recently discussed this [topic](https://www.coindesk.com/long-secret-bitcoin-key-finally-revealed/).

One of the reasons for disclosure of the keys is to mitigate the effects of unknown dissemination and proliferation of the keys. By broadcasting the values to make them available to everyone, the value of the keys is intended to be to be eliminated, since now everyone could feasibly sign messages, the value of the signed messages becomes zero.

## Vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin Alert system

The following text discloses a number of known vulnerabilities in the alert system.

The Alert System previously utilized by Bitcoin has several issues (some of which may be classified as vulnerabilities). These issues no longer exist in Bitcoin as of network protocol version 700013 which was released with Bitcoin Core 0.13.0. Many altcoins and Bitcoin client implementations were notified of the Alert Systemâs removal and have since removed the alert system themselves or transitioned to using an Alert system that does not share an Alert Key with Bitcoin.

All of the issues described below allow an attacker in possession of the Alert Key to perform a Denial of Service attack on nodes that still support the Alert system. These issues involve the exhaustion of memory which causes node software to crash or be killed due to excessive memory usage.

Many of these issues were not known until the Alert System was removed as developers inspected the code for vulnerabilities prior to releasing the Alert Key. Due to these issues, the publication of the Alert Key was delayed and affected altcoins and software were notified.

As of this writing, less than 4% of Bitcoin nodes are vulnerable. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Core developers have created a âfinal alertâ which is a maximum ID number alert which overrides all previous alerts and displays a fixed âURGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade requiredâ message on all vulnerable software. The Bitcoin Core developers believe that so few vulnerable nodes are present on the network, and risks to those nodes so minor, that it is safe to publish the Alert Key.

An Alert contains these fields:

```
int32_t nVersion;
int64_t nRelayUntil;      // when newer nodes stop relaying to newer nodes
int64_t nExpiration;
int32_t nID;
int32_t nCancel;
std::set<int32_t> setCancel;
int32_t nMinVer;            // lowest version inclusive
int32_t nMaxVer;            // highest version inclusive
std::set<std::string> setSubVer;  // empty matches all
int32_t nPriority;

```

Alerts are also identified by their SHA256 hash. The above fields can be freely modified to generate alerts with differing hashes.

### Infinitely Sized Map (CVE-2016-10724)

The Alert System was designed to support multiple Alerts simultaneously. As such, Alerts were stored in memory in a map. However, there is no limit on how large this map can be, thus an attacker with the Alert Key can send a large number of Alerts to a node. Eventually, the map containing all of the Alerts will be so large that the node runs out of memory and crashes, thus causing a Denial of Service attack.

The infinitely sized map is the basis for which the Alert system can be used to cause Denial of Service attacks.

### Infinitely Sized Alerts

Although the infinitely sized map is what causes the crash itself, an attacker can also send very large Alerts. Alerts themselves are not limited in size explicitly, they are only limited by the maximum network message size. This maximum network message size has varied between versions. At times in the past, it has been 32 MB. For Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 (the most recent version of Bitcoin Core with the alert system enabled by default), the maximum message size is 2 MB.

Although large Alerts do not directly cause a Denial of Service by themselves, combined with the infinitely sized map, large Alerts can more quickly cause a node to run out of memory.

* The `setCancel` field has no length limit (besides the maximum message size) and is a std::set of 32-bit integers. Given that it has no size constraints, an attacker can use this field to create a very large Alert by filling the set with many integers.
* The `setSubVer` field, like `setCancel`, has no length limit and is a std::set. However instead of integers it has std::strings. These strings do not have a length limit themselves and can thus be arbitrarily long to produce an Alert that is arbitrarily large.
* Bitcoin Core versions prior to 0.10.0 did not have a limit on the length of the `strComment`, `strStatusBar`, and `strReserved` fields. These strings can have an arbitrary length.

### The Final Alert

To protect against attackers abusing the Alert key following its publication, the Bitcoin Core developers constructed a âfinal alertâ. This final alert is a maximum ID alert which overrides all previous alerts. All Bitcoin Core versions since and including Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 contain the final alert and will send it to any node which is vulnerable to issues including the following disclosures. However this protection is not enough to protect those nodes as a few issues were found with the final alert implementation itself.

Final alerts are those which meet the following conditions:

```
nExpiration == maxInt &&
nCancel == (maxInt-1) &&
nMinVer == 0 &&
nMaxVer == maxInt &&
setSubVer.empty() &&
nPriority == maxInt &&
strStatusBar == "URGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade required"

```

`maxInt` is the maximum signed integer as defined by `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`.

### Multiple Final Alerts

The definition for a final alert does not include a few fields. Because alerts are identified by their hashes, changing the ommitted fields allows an Alert to be classified as a final alert but still be an alert that is added to the infinitely sized map.

* Since `setCancel` is not required to be empty for an alert to be a final alert, the `setCancel` field can contain different integers to produce alerts that have different hashes and are thus different alerts. Combined with the infinitely sized map and the infinitely sized `setCancel` issues, many final alerts can be created which are large, fill the map, and cause a node to run out of memory.
* The `strComment` field, while having a maximum length of 65536 bytes, is not required to be a particular string in order for an alert to be a final alert. Thus multiple final alerts can be crafted which have different hashes by using different values for `strComment`
* The`strReserved` field, while having a maximum length of 256 bytes, is not required to be a particular string in order for an alert to be a final alert. Thus multiple final alerts can be crafted which have different hashes by using different values for `strReserved`.
* The `nVersion` field is also not required to be a particular value. Thus this can be used to construct final alerts with different hashes by having different values for `nVersion`.
* `nRelayUntil` field is also not required to be a particular value. Thus this can be used to construct final alerts with different hashes by having different values for `nRelayUntil`.

### Final Alert Cancellation (CVE-2016-10725)

Although the final alert is supposed to be uncancellable, it unfortunately is cancellable due to the order of actions when processing an alert. Alerts are first processed by checking whether they cancel any existing alert. Then they are checked whether any of the remaining alerts cancels it. Because of this order, it is possible to create an alert which cancels a final alert before the node checks whether that alert is canceled by the final alert. Thus an attacker can cancel a final alert with another alert allowing a node to be vulnerable to all of the aforementioned attacks.

## Protecting Against DoS Attacks from the Alert System

Fixing these issues is relatively easy. The first and most obvious solution is to simply remove the Alert system entirely. As nodes upgrade to versions without the Alert system, fewer nodes will be vulnerable to attack should the Alert keys become public. This is the option that Bitcoin has taken. However, because Bitcoin has retired the Alert system entirely, the Alert key will also be published to reduce the risk that the Alert Key is mistakenly depended upon in the future.

Should altcoins wish to continue using the Alert system but with a different Alert Key, a few very simple fixes will safeguard nodes from the aforementioned issues. Limiting the number of alerts, the size of `setCancel` and `setSubVer`, and only allowing one final alert altogether fix the above issues. [This patch](https://gist.github.com/achow101/02d03238090691558a68010a9ccbbf9d), on top of Bitcoin Core 0.11 (a vulnerable version), fixes the aforementioned issues. Altcoins that still use the Alert system are recommended to port this patch to their software. Outdated node software is still vulnerable.

## Summary

Eleven months ago we discovered a counterfeiting vulnerability in the cryptography underlying some kinds of zero-knowledge proofs. This post provides details on the vulnerability, how we fixed it and the steps taken to protect Zcash users.

The counterfeiting vulnerability was fixed by the Sapling network upgrade that activated on October 28th, 2018. The vulnerability was specific to counterfeiting and did not affect user privacy in any way. Prior to its remediation, an attacker could have created fake Zcash without being detected. **The counterfeiting vulnerability has been fully remediated in Zcash and no action is required by Zcash users**.

The counterfeiting vulnerability was discovered by a cryptographer employed by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (aka The Zcash Company) on March 1st, 2018. It was not reported publicly at the time in order to protect against it being exploited prior to its remediation, and to provide information and remediated code to other projects that were also vulnerable. We employed stringent operational security measures to keep its existence a secret, even from our own engineers.

We believe that no one else was aware of the vulnerability and that no counterfeiting occurred in Zcash for the following reasons:

* Discovery of the vulnerability would have required a high level of technical and cryptographic sophistication that very few people possess.
* The vulnerability had existed for years but was undiscovered by numerous expert cryptographers, scientists, third-party auditors, and third-party engineering teams who initiated new projects based upon the Zcash code.
* The Zcash Company has seen no evidence that counterfeiting has occurred as might be discovered by monitoring the the total amount of Zcash held in Sprout addresses (i.e., the Sprout shielded pool). As long as the value in the shielded pools are greater than zero, no counterfeiting has been detected. Bitfly’s [Zcha.in displays these values on the network statistics page](https://zcha.in/statistics/network), and Zcash nodes report them in the output of the [getblockchaininfo command](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/sapling_turnstile.html).
* Upon discovering the vulnerability, the Zcash Company took extraordinary measures to minimize the possibility of exploitation. The specifics of our steps taken are documented in the detail below.
* The Zcash Company studied the blockchain for evidence of exploitation: An attack might leave a specific kind of footprint. We found no such footprint.

Although we believe that no counterfeiting occurred, we are monitoring pool totals and will act in accordance with our [published defense against counterfeiting](https://z.cash/blog/defense-against-counterfeiting-in-shielded-pools/) in an effort to preserve the monetary supply.

Zcash makes use of the most sophisticated and novel cryptography available on a public blockchain. Pushing cryptographic boundaries is inherently risky and user safety is of highest importance for the Zcash Company. We believe that the steps we have taken to mitigate the issue while working to ensure the safety of Zcash users has been successful. More information on the specific events that transpired from the initial discovery of the counterfeiting vulnerability through this disclosure will be covered in a future post.

### Key Points:

* A counterfeiting vulnerability was discovered in Zcash by a Zcash Company cryptographer.
* The counterfeiting vulnerability has been fully remediated in Zcash and no action is required by Zcash users.
* The successful remediation for Sprout addresses was introduced by the Zcash Company in the Zcash Sapling upgrade that occurred on the 28th of October, 2018.
* The vulnerability was specific to counterfeiting and its exploitation would not have impacted privacy.
* Zcash has not been susceptible to this attack since the Sapling activation.
* We have found no evidence that the vulnerability was discovered by anyone else or that counterfeiting occurred.
* The Zcash Company used best practices in operational security to keep this information private, and responsible disclosure to share it with two affected projects.

## Background

On March 1, 2018, Ariel Gabizon, a cryptographer employed by the Zcash Company at the time, discovered a subtle cryptographic flaw in the [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] paper that describes the zk-SNARK construction used in the original launch of Zcash. The flaw allows an attacker to create counterfeit shielded value in any system that depends on parameters which are generated as described by the paper.

This vulnerability is so subtle that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zero-knowledge proving systems and zk-SNARKs. In an analysis [[Parno15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437)] in 2015, Bryan Parno from Microsoft Research discovered a different mistake in the paper. However, the vulnerability we discovered appears to have evaded his analysis. The vulnerability also appears in the subversion zero-knowledge SNARK scheme of [[Fuchsbauer17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/587)], where an adaptation of [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] inherits the flaw. The vulnerability also appears in the ADSNARK construction described in [[BBFR14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/617)]. Finally, the vulnerability evaded the Zcash Company’s own cryptography team, which includes experts in the field that had [identified several flaws in other parts of the system](https://z.cash/blog/fixing-zcash-vulns/).

Importantly, the [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] construction did not have a dedicated security proof, as noted in [[Parno15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437)], and relied mainly on the [[PGHR13](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279)] security proof and the similarity between the two schemes. The Zcash Company team did attempt to write a security proof in [[BGG17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/602)], but it did not uncover this vulnerability. Zcash has since upgraded to a new proving system [[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260)] which has multiple independent proofs and significantly better analysis.

After finding the vulnerability, Ariel immediately contacted another cryptographer at the Zcash Company, Sean Bowe. After Sean confirmed the existence of the vulnerability, Zooko Wilcox (CEO of the Zcash Company) and Nathan Wilcox (CTO of the Zcash Company) were briefed. Through careful coordination, the counterfeiting vulnerability was mitigated in the Zcash network without any known further disclosure outside this group of four people.

With the activation of Sapling, Sprout transactions were moved onto the new [[Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260)] proving system, fixing the issue on the Zcash network as described below.

To exploit the counterfeiting vulnerability, an attacker would have needed to possess information found in the large MPC protocol transcript that was made available shortly after the launch of Zcash. This transcript had not been widely downloaded and was removed from public availability immediately upon discovery of the vulnerability to make it more difficult to exploit. The Zcash Company adopted and maintained a cover story that the transcript was missing due to accidental deletion. The transcript was later reconstructed from DVDs collected from the participants of the original ceremony and posted following the Sapling activation.

We have been monitoring the total of funds in the Sprout pool against time and have not found any indication that any counterfeiting activity has taken place.

## Counterfeiting Vulnerability Details

The [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] parameter setup algorithm, as described by the paper, mistakenly produces extra elements that violate the soundness of the proving system. The construction described by [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] Appendix B is a variant of the [[PGHR13](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279)] zk-SNARK scheme with modifications to improve performance and adapt the scheme for the asymmetric pairing setting. This scheme was used in the original launch of Zcash and has been independently implemented by several other projects.

Ariel Gabizon, a cryptographer employed by the Zcash Company at the time of discovery, uncovered a soundness vulnerability. The key generation procedure of [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)], in step 3, produces various elements that are the result of evaluating polynomials related to the statement being proven. Some of these elements are unused by the prover and were included by mistake; but their presence allows a cheating prover to circumvent a consistency check, and thereby transform the proof of one statement into a valid-looking proof of a different statement. This breaks the soundness of the proving system.

The [[BGG17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/602)] multi-party computation (MPC) protocol that produced Sprout parameters for the [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] construction follows the paper’s setup procedure, including the computation of the extra elements. These are not included in the actual parameters distributed to Zcash nodes since they are omitted from the parameter file format used by the proving routine implementation of [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] in the libsnark library (used by Sprout). However, these elements do appear in the MPC ceremony transcript. Consequently, anyone with access to the ceremony transcript would have been able to create false proofs.

### What is affected?

While Zcash is no longer affected, any project that depends on the MPC ceremony used by the original Sprout system that was distributed in the initial launch of Zcash is vulnerable. This original Sprout system for shielded funds is comprised of the original Sprout circuit, the [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] proving system using libsnark, and the parameters generated by an MPC ceremony [[BGG17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/602)]. It was used by the 1.x series of Zcash software (which also carried the “Sprout” name).

The algorithm described in [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)], before the update corresponding to this disclosure, is vulnerable (though its [libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark) implementation, when used with its built-in parameter generation is not). The vulnerability was included in some independent implementations of [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)], such as [[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)], even though they do not require an MPC. Similar flaws can be found in the [[BBFR14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/617)] and [[Fuchsbauer17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/587)] zk-SNARK schemes.

We do not have an exhaustive list of all systems affected by this vulnerability, and we encourage all users, developers and maintainers of systems using [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)] to take the time to triage this issue and check if they are affected.

### What is not affected?

The newer Sprout-on-Groth16 system used by Zcash mainnet for Sprout addresses ever since the Sapling activation (block 419200 at 28 Oct 2018) is not affected by the counterfeiting vulnerability. It uses a new Sprout circuit, that runs on the Groth16 proving system, with new parameters, and operates on the BLS12-381 curve implemented in the Bellman library. The newer Sapling system for shielded funds, activated at the same time and using a new address format, is not vulnerable either.

The vulnerability is not present in the algorithms of [[PGHR13](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279)] (which underlies [[BCTV14](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)]), nor in [[BCGTV13](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507)], which used similar techniques. It is also not present in other zk-SNARKs constructions, such as [[GM17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/540.pdf)] or [[BG18](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/187)], or in zero-knowledge proof systems that do not rely on a structured reference string. It is not present in libsnark when used with its built-in parameter generator.

## Third Party Disclosure

An analysis of the market cap of affected projects revealed that we could reach more than a two thirds majority of affected capital with only two disclosures: Horizen, with whom we already had a reciprocal vulnerability disclosure agreement, and Komodo who we worked with to form a disclosure agreement in order to disclose this issue to them privately.

We established a ninety-day maximum public disclosure timeline with both parties, and provided the conditions required for a workable solution.

Further disclosure would have significantly increased the risk of exploitation of the majority of capital for much smaller gains in terms of coverage of users and capital. To protect the shielded pools of these and other projects, exact details of the cause of the vulnerability were redacted from the private disclosures. It appears that both Horizen and Komodo have taken appropriate actions per our recommendation. We recommend that third parties including affected projects, wallets, and exchanges, carefully consider how best to work through the upgrades needed to fix this issue.

## Timeline of Events

### 01 March 2018

Ariel Gabizon, a cryptographer working for the Zcash Company, discovered the flaw while attending the Financial Cryptography 2018 conference, where he had been invited to present [[BGG17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/602)] to the Bitcoin’18 workshop. Sean Bowe, a cryptographer at the Zcash Company, and Zooko Wilcox, the CEO of the Zcash Company, were also attending the conference.

The issue was discovered by Ariel the night before his presentation, and he contacted Sean to confirm. Sean met Ariel in person and the two contacted Zooko immediately. Zooko then met Sean and Ariel in person to determine a response strategy. It was quickly determined that the transcript (which would allow an adversary to create false proofs) should be deleted from where it had been publicly made available by the company, since it appeared unlikely that many had downloaded it until that point. Zooko contacted Nathan Wilcox, the CTO of the Zcash Company, to ask him to delete the transcript.

### 02 March 2018 – 27 October 2018

Nathan deleted the transcript under a coinciding operational security cover story.

Sean had an additional backup of the transcript, which was later transferred into the dual possession of Sean and Zooko (Sean kept an encryption key, while Zooko deposited the USB in a safe deposit box) until it was later decided to destroy the backup entirely.

Two mitigation strategies were proposed. Ariel proposed a mitigation which involved an emergency hardfork that required users to switch to new zk-SNARK parameters that did not suffer from the vulnerability, by re-randomizing or replacing the existing parameters in a subsequent ceremony. Sean proposed that the mitigation be covertly included in the Sapling network upgrade by switching to the Groth16 proving system and parameters constructed in the upcoming Sapling ceremony. The team agreed to adopt Sean’s recommendation.

Covert mitigations were developed and deployed without further known disclosures beyond these four individuals.

The Zcash Company did not disclose the specifics of the vulnerability, only its existence and our recommendation to upgrade their proving system to Groth16. We also did not tell them who else was notified. The [complete message and disclosure sent to both Horizen and Komodo](#correspondence-horizen-komodo) is copied below.

Three hours later, Zencash responded to say that they had decrypted our message and that they were looking into the issue.

## Technical Details of CVE-2019-7167

Title
\*\*\*\*\*

BCTV14 setup produces elements that violate soundness leading to Counterfeiting Vulnerability in Zcash and others

Description
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The construction described by [BCTV14] in Appendix B, is a variant of the [PGHR13] zk-SNARK scheme with modifications to improve performance. This scheme was used in the original 2016 launch of Zcash and has been independently implemented by several other projects.

Ariel Gabizon, while working for the Zcash company, discovered a soundness bug in [BCTV14] that is described in this security notice:

The key generation procedure of [BCTV14], in step 3, produces various elements that are the result of evaluating polynomials related to the statement being proven. Some of these elements are unused by the prover and were included by mistake; but their presence allows a cheating prover to circumvent a consistency check, and thereby transform the proof of one statement into a valid-looking proof of a different statement. This breaks the soundness of the proof system. We refer to these elements as “bypass elements.”

The [BGG17] multi-party computation (MPC) protocol that produces parameters for the [BCTV14] construction follows the setup procedure closely, and so the bypass elements are produced. They are not included in the actual proving key distributed to Zcash nodes since they are explicitly excluded from the parameter file format used by the proving routine implementation of [BCTV14] in the “libsnark” library (used by Sprout). However, these elements do appear in the MPC ceremony transcript. Consequently, anyone with access to the ceremony transcript would have been able to create false proofs.

The vulnerability also affects an older MPC scheme [BCGTV15]. This vulnerability was also included in some independent implementations of [BCTV14], such as [snarkjs], even though they do not require an MPC. Similar flaws can be found in the [BBFR14] and [Fuchsbauer17] zk-SNARK schemes, which are adaptations of [BCTV14].

Impact
\*\*\*\*\*

The ability to break soundness in the proving system permits the creation of false proofs. Zero-knowledge proofs are used in a system like Zcash to ensure that transactions are valid, so this implies the ability to create an unlimited amount of shielded coins where the verifier is affected by this bug.

Credit
\*\*\*\*\*\*

This vulnerability was discovered by Ariel Gabizon while he was working for the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company.

What is affected?
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Any project that implements [BCTV14] and does not completely dispose of the bypass elements as part of the setup process.

That includes but is not limited to any project that depends on the trusted setup used by the original Sprout system that was distributed in the initial 2016 launch of Zcash. This original Sprout system for shielded funds is comprised of the original Sprout circuit, the [BCTV14] proving system using libsnark, and the parameters generated by an MPC ceremony [BGG17]. It was used by the 1.x series of Zcash software (which also carried the “Sprout” name).

[BCTV14] is available at [https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//eprint.iacr.org/2013/879)

What is not affected?
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The newer Sprout-on-Groth16 system used by Zcash mainnet for Sprout addresses ever since the Sapling activation (block 419200 at 28 Oct 2018) is not affected by the counterfeiting vulnerability. It uses a new Sprout circuit, that runs on the Groth16 proving system, with new parameters, and operates on the BLS12-381 curve implemented in the Bellman library. The newer Sapling system for shielded funds, activated at the same time and using a new address format, is not vulnerable either.

The vulnerability is not present in the algorithms of [PGHR13] (which underlies [BCTV14]), nor in [BCGTV13], which used similar techniques. It is also not present in other zk-SNARKs constructions, such as [GM17] or [BG18], or in zero-knowledge proof systems that do not rely on a structured reference string. It is not present in libsnark when used with its built-in parameter generator.

The new Sprout-on-Groth16 circuit implementation is located here at time of publishing this information: [https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-crypto/tree/master/src/circuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-crypto/tree/master/src/circuit)

The new Sprout-on-Groth16 proving and verifying routines are located in the librustzcash library (at time of publishing): [https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash/librustzcash)

The Groth16 proving system is implemented in the Bellman Rust library: [https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zkcrypto/bellman)

Mitigation
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Users of projects still affected by this issue should change the zk-SNARK parameters to some that are not affected by this bug. Zcash switched to new parameters using a new “Sprout-on-Groth16” proving system as of the Sapling network upgrade on October 28th 2018, and so is not affected by the bug.

Therefore, users of Zcash do not need to take any action.

Projects still affected by this vulnerability that do not wish to switch proving systems might instead wish to perform their own parameter setup to produce replacement parameters. Projects following this path are strongly encouraged to use a large, public MPC with thorough security analysis. In the interim, they are advised to disable functionality (e.g., shielded transactions) that relies on the affected proof system.

## Correspondence to Horizen and Komodo

Hello,

There is a serious vulnerability in your software. Enclosed is a private advisory with more detail about the vulnerability. We strongly recommend keeping the impact of this issue secret until your project is able to deploy mitigations, because of the associated risks to projects that are still affected and people who know the details.

The issue was discovered internally at Zcash and extreme caution has been exercised to protect its existence from premature disclosure, to avoid exploitation anywhere and to assure the availability of our network and the safety of our people. With the activation of Sapling, our network is no longer vulnerable to this bug, but we’d like to take the right steps to provide you a similar opportunity without putting any of our people at risk.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to create very large, virtually unlimited amounts of counterfeit shielded tokens without detection.

In order to mitigate this bug, we recommend a hardfork that adopts the newer Groth16 implementation of Sprout shielded transactions, which uses a more secure circuit implementation and parameters and is not affected by this bug.

This mitigation was successfully deployed in Zcash as part of the Sapling network upgrade. This mitigation has several advantages, but among them is that it does not require alerting anyone to the existence of a security bug in order to deploy, because the upgrade has legitimate performance and security benefits beyond fixing this bug.

Other possible mitigations for this bug have been analyzed and determined to be too expensive and risky to undertake. Further, revealing those considerations would make it harder for you to protect your users, given that other projects are also affected. Our best effort has been put into developing a strong mitigation to this bug in our own software, which we believe now presents you with a far simpler upgrade path than you might otherwise face.

We have disclosed this to the largest projects who use this code by market cap in order to protect the largest possible amount of capital, however we have decided not to alert all other affected projects yet.

I would like to assign a CVE to this issue, then publish the full details of this vulnerability publicly and notify all remaining affected projects no later than ninety days from today’s date: Today is Tuesday November 13th 2018, meaning I’d like to publicly disclose full details of this issue before Monday February 11th 2019 at the latest.

I will do my best to assist you in understanding the software upgrade path.

Title
\*\*\*\*\*

Sprout shielded transaction bug allows for unlimited counterfeiting.

Description
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A fundamental cryptographic flaw exists that allows an attacker to create proofs that falsely convince the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier of the correctness of a transaction.

Impact
\*\*\*\*\*\*

By exploiting this bug, an attacker could create fake Sprout shielded notes containing large amounts of counterfeit funds without being detected.

Credit
\*\*\*\*\*\*

We would like to include credit for this discovery in a coordinated public release after your software is fixed and your users are safe.

What is affected?
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Any project that depends on the original Sprout system that was distributed in the initial launch of Zcash.

The original Sprout zk-SNARK system is comprised of the original Sprout circuit and parameters on the [BCTV14] proving system using libsnark and was used by the 1.x series of Zcash software (which also carried the “Sprout” name).

The original Sprout circuit implementation is here:
[https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/src/zcash/circuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/src/zcash/circuit)

The original Sprout zk-SNARK parameters are here:
[https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key)
[https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-verifying.key](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//z.cash/downloads/sprout-verifying.key)

The Sprout proving and verifying routines are here:
[https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/zcash/JoinSplit.cpp](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/zcash/JoinSplit.cpp)

The BCTV14 proving system implementation (in libsnark) is here:
[https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/src/snark/libsnark/zk\_proof\_systems/ppzksnark/r1cs\_ppzksnark](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/src/snark/libsnark/zk_proof_systems/ppzksnark/r1cs_ppzksnark)

What is not affected?
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The newer Sprout-on-Groth16 system used by Zcash mainnet for Sprout transactions on and after block 419200 is not affected by this bug. It uses a new Sprout circuit, that runs on the Groth16 proving system, new parameters and operates on the BLS12-381 curve implemented in the Bellman library.

The new Sprout-on-Groth16 circuit implementation is located here:
[https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-crypto/tree/master/src/circuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-crypto/tree/master/src/circuit)

The new Sprout-on-Groth16 zk-SNARK parameters are located here:
[https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params)

The new Sprout-on-Groth16 proving and verifying routines are located in the librustzcash library:
[https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zcash/librustzcash)

The Groth16 proving system is implemented in the Bellman Rust library:
[https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman](https://web.archive.org/web/20231206230039/https%3A//github.com/zkcrypto/bellman)

Mitigation
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

We strongly recommend that you switch to the newer Sprout-on-Groth16 zk-SNARK system, as it is not vulnerable to this bug.

Publication Timeline
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

We would like to publish this vulnerability publicly and notify all other affected projects who are not in our initial distribution list using Github’s security response system, and on our social media channels and website no later than 90 days from today’s date. Today is Tuesday November 13th 2018, meaning I’d like to publicly disclose full details of this issue before Monday February 11th 2019 at the latest.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

Subject: [[bitcoin-dev] Alert key disclosure](#r)
Date: Mon, 2 Jul 2018 18:03:13 -0500	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <CABaSBay8r4JkXkgUZJm30tZKHk-55ho6-C5Hf15ovuNk_VZWEg@mail.gmail.com> (<raw>)

The bitcoin alert keys are disclosed in this email, followed by a
disclosure of various known vulnerabilities in what was once the alert
system. The bitcoin alert system has been completely retired. The
network is not at risk and this warning may be safely ignored if you
do not have an ancient node (running v0.12.x or older) using the
deprecated bitcoin alert system or its public keys.

These are openssl-serialized private keys.

In 2016, a plan was proposed[1] for the completion of the retirement
of the bitcoin alert system which included the idea of revealing the
alert system private keys. The proposal still contains good
information regarding the purpose and intention of alert system
retirement and motivation for the disclosure of the private keys.
Additionally, an overview of the alert system retirement and its
timeline is available on the web at [2]. This disclosure was recently
discussed in an IRC meeting logs at [3]. A media site also recently
discussed this topic[4].

One of the reasons for disclosure of the keys is to mitigate the
effects of unknown dissemination and proliferation of the keys. By
broadcasting the values to make them available to everyone, the value
of the keys is intended to be to be eliminated, since now everyone
could feasibly sign messages, the value of the signed messages becomes

# Vulnerabilities in the bitcoin alert system

The following text[5] discloses a number of known vulnerabilities in
the alert system. Writeup contributed by achow101.

[5] <https://gist.github.com/achow101/18a2dfc371c421419d494a3ae0447f66>

The Alert System previously utilized by Bitcoin has several issues
(some of which may be classified as vulnerabilities). These issues no
longer exist in Bitcoin as of network protocol version 700013 which
was released with Bitcoin Core 0.13.0. Many altcoins and Bitcoin
client implementations were notified of the Alert System's removal and
have since removed the alert system themselves or transitioned to
using an Alert system that does not share an Alert Key with Bitcoin.

All of the issues described below allow an attacker in possession of
the Alert Key to perform a Denial of Service attack on nodes that
still support the Alert system. These issues involve the exhaustion of
memory which causes node software to crash or be killed due to
excessive memory usage.

Many of these issues were not known until the Alert System was removed
as developers inspected the code for vulnerabilities prior to
releasing the Alert Key. Due to these issues, the publication of the
Alert Key was delayed and affected altcoins and software were
notified.

As of this writing, less than 4% of Bitcoin nodes are vulnerable.
Furthermore, the Bitcoin Core developers have created a "final alert"
which is a maximum ID number alert which overrides all previous alerts
and displays a fixed "URGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade required"
message on all vulnerable software. The Bitcoin Core developers
believe that so few vulnerable nodes are present on the network, and
risks to those nodes so minor, that it is safe to publish the Alert
Key.

An Alert contains these fields:

    int32_t nVersion;
    int64_t nRelayUntil;      // when newer nodes stop relaying to newer nodes
    int64_t nExpiration;
    int32_t nID;
    int32_t nCancel;
    std::set<int32_t> setCancel;
    int32_t nMinVer;            // lowest version inclusive
    int32_t nMaxVer;            // highest version inclusive
    std::set<std::string> setSubVer;  // empty matches all
    int32_t nPriority;

Alerts are also identified by their SHA256 hash. The above fields can
be freely modified to generate alerts with differing hashes.

# Infinitely sized map (CVE-2016-10724)

The Alert System was designed to support multiple Alerts
simultaneously. As such, Alerts were stored in memory in a map.
However, there is no limit on how large this map can be, thus an
attacker with the Alert Key can send a large number of Alerts to a
node. Eventually, the map containing all of the Alerts will be so
large that the node runs out of memory and crashes, thus causing a
Denial of Service attack.

The infinitely sized map is the basis for which the Alert system can
be used to cause Denial of Service attacks.

# Infinitely sized alerts

Although the infinitely sized map is what causes the crash itself, an
attacker can also send very large Alerts. Alerts themselves are not
limited in size explicitly, they are only limited by the maximum
network message size. This maximum network message size has varied
between versions. At times in the past, it has been 32 MB. For Bitcoin
Core 0.12.0 (the most recent version of Bitcoin Core with the alert
system enabled by default), the maximum message size is 2 MB.

Although large Alerts do not directly cause a Denial of Service by
themselves, combined with the infinitely sized map, large Alerts can
more quickly cause a node to run out of memory.

* The setCancel field has no length limit (besides the maximum message
size) and is a std::set of 32-bit integers. Given that it has no size
constraints, an attacker can use this field to create a very large
Alert by filling the set with many integers.

* The setSubVer field, like setCancel, has no length limit and is a
std::set. However instead of integers it has std::strings. These
strings do not have a length limit themselves and can thus be
arbitrarily long to produce an Alert that is arbitrarily large.

* Bitcoin Core versions prior to 0.10.0 did not have a limit on the
length of the strComment, strStatusBar, and strReserved fields. These
strings can have an arbitrary length.

# The final alert

To protect against attackers abusing the Alert key following its
publication, the Bitcoin Core developers constructed a "final alert".
This final alert is a maximum ID alert which overrides all previous
alerts. All Bitcoin Core versions since and including Bitcoin Core
0.14.0 contain the final alert and will send it to any node which is
vulnerable to issues including the following disclosures. However this
protection is not enough to protect those nodes as a few issues were
found with the final alert implementation itself.

Final alerts are those which meet the following conditions:

    nExpiration == maxInt &&
    nCancel == (maxInt-1) &&
    nMinVer == 0 &&
    nMaxVer == maxInt &&
    setSubVer.empty() &&
    nPriority == maxInt &&
    strStatusBar == "URGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade required"

maxInt is the maximum signed integer as defined by
std::numeric_limits<int>::max().

# Multiple final alerts

The definition for a final alert does not include a few fields.
Because alerts are identified by their hashes, changing the omitted
fields allows an Alert to be classified as a final alert but still be
an alert that is added to the infinitely sized map. The nCancel field
omits the maxInt ID number used by the final alert so all of the final
alerts share the same ID.

* Since setCancel is not required to be empty for an alert to be a
final alert, the setCancel field can contain different integers to
produce alerts that have different hashes and are thus different
alerts. Combined with the infinitely sized map and the infinitely
sized setCancel issues, many final alerts can be created which are
large, fill the map, and cause a node to run out of memory.

* The strComment field, while having a maximum length of 65536 bytes
(and no maximum length prior to Bitcoin Core version 0.10.0), is not
required to be a particular string in order for an alert to be a final
alert. Thus multiple final alerts can be crafted which have different
hashes by using different values for strComment

* The strReserved field, while having a maximum length of 256 bytes,
is not required to be a particular string in order for an alert to be
a final alert. Thus multiple final alerts can be crafted which have
different hashes by using different values for strReserved.

* The nVersion field is also not required to be a particular value.
Thus this can be used to construct final alerts with different hashes
by having different values for nVersion.

* nRelayUntil field is also not required to be a particular value.
Thus this can be used to construct final alerts with different hashes
by having different values for nRelayUntil.

# Final Alert Cancellation (CVE-2016-10725)

Although the final alert is supposed to be uncancellable, it
unfortunately is cancellable due to the order of actions when
processing an alert. Alerts are first processed by checking whether
they cancel any existing alert. Then they are checked whether any of
the remaining alerts cancels it. Because of this order, it is possible
to create an alert which cancels a final alert before the node checks
whether that alert is canceled by the final alert. Thus an attacker
can cancel a final alert with another alert allowing a node to be
vulnerable to all of the aforementioned attacks.

# Protecting against DoS attacks from the alert system

Fixing these issues is relatively easy. The first and most obvious
solution is to simply remove the Alert system entirely. As nodes
upgrade to versions without the Alert system, fewer nodes will be
vulnerable to attack should the Alert keys become public. This is the
option that Bitcoin has taken. However, because Bitcoin has retired
the Alert system entirely, the Alert key will also be published to
reduce the risk that the Alert Key is mistakenly depended upon in the
future.
Should altcoins wish to continue using the Alert system but with a
different Alert Key, a few very simple fixes will safeguard nodes from
the aforementioned issues. Limiting the number of alerts, the size of
setCancel and setSubVer, and only allowing one final alert altogether
fix the above issues. This patch[6], on top of Bitcoin Core 0.11 (a
vulnerable version), fixes the aforementioned issues. Altcoins that
still use the Alert system are recommended to port this patch to their
software. Outdated node software is still vulnerable.

This disclosure was authored primarily by Bryan Bishop (kanzure) and
Andrew Chow (achow101). Special thanks to reviewers. Also, an
interesting proposal was floated to not disclose the private keys in
WIF format-- one is that this is not how the original values were
received, and second (more importantly) to prevent users from
importing the key into their wallet and reusing it in their wallet key
circulation.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## CVE-2018-17144

[National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Report](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17144)

A reachable assert statement in Bitcoin Core allows a remote denial of service (application crash) exploitable by miners via attempting to double-spend a transaction insinde a mined block. This CVE also later leads to an inflation bug, which we do not focus on here.

The code relevant to this vulnerability can be found in the file `validation.cpp` of Bitcoin Core 0.14.X.
This specific file can be found [here](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/tree/master/CVE-2018-17144/Bitcoin-0.14.X).

When a block containing a double spent transaction is validated, it skips the duplicate input check because of the false parameter [here](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2018-17144/Bitcoin-0.14.X/validation.cpp#L2883). The double spend will reach the function [UpdateCoins()](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2018-17144/Bitcoin-0.14.X/validation.cpp#L1323), and the inputs to the transaction are being marked as spent in the Unspent Transaction Output(UTXO) database. The first time the transaction is seen, the coins involved are marked as spent. Since the coins involved in the transaction are already marked as spent, the second time the transaction is seen, `coins->vout[nPos].IsNull()` will be true. It will then enter this [if statement](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2018-17144/Bitcoin-0.14.X/validation.cpp#L1332) and subsequently execute the assert statement that follows. The assert then causes the node to crash, resulting in the denial of service vulnerability. (Paraphrased from Source 2)

The coin(s) that we found to still contain this vulnerability as of 26/3/2019 include:

* [Irlecoin](https://github.com/irlecoin/irlecoin)
* [MinexCoin](https://github.com/minexcoin/minexcoin) (Fixed)
* [MktCoin](https://github.com/mktcoin/mktcoin)
* [PlatinCoin](https://github.com/platincoin-project/platincoin)
* [QuasarCoin](https://github.com/quasarcoin/quasar)
* [TCOIN](https://github.com/koba24/tcoin)

**Total Coins: 6**

## CVE-2019-7167

[National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Report](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7167)

BCTV14 setup produces elements that violate soundness, misleading the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction. This allows an attacker to create very large, virtually unlimited amounts of counterfeit shielded tokens without detection. Zcash has switched to different parameters using a new “Sprout-on-Groth16” proving system as of the Sapling network upgrade on October 28th 2018, and so is not affected by the bug.

The code relevant to this vulnerability can be found in the file `JoinSplit.cpp` of Zcash 1.X.
This specific file can be found [here](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2019-7167/Zcash-1.X/JoinSplit.cpp).

The coin(s) that we found to still contain this vulnerability as of 27/5/2019 include:

* [Hush](https://github.com/MyHush/hush)

**Total Coins: 1**

## CVE-2016-10724 / CVE-2016-10725

These two vulnerabilites are closely related and hence are grouped in the same section. All coins presented in this section are vulnerable to both vulnerabilities.

### CVE-2016-10724

[National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Report](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10724)

A remote network alert system originating from Bitcoin allows the denial of service (memory exhaustion) if an attacker can sign a message with a certain private key that had been known by unintended actors. Due to an infinitely sized map, an attacker can send a large number of alerts (or very large alerts, or both) to a node, causing the node to run out of memory and crash.

### CVE-2016-10725

[National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Report](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10725)

A 'final alert' was developed to prevent attackers from abusing CVE-2016-10724, which comprises a maximum ID alert that overrides all previous alerts. A final alert is an alert that meets the following conditions [here](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2016-10724/Bitcoin-0.12.X/alert.cpp#L190-L196). However, due to alerts being classified by their hashes, any alert can be classified as a final alert, which can also cause the the node to run out of memory.
Final alerts are also supposed to be uncancellable, but can inadvertently be cancelled. Alerts first check they cancel any existing alert. Then they are checked for whether any of the remaining alerts cancel it. Because of this order, it is possible to create an alert which cancels a final alert before the node checks whether that alert is cancelled by the final alert. Thus an attacker can cancel a final alert with another alert allowing a node to also be vulnerable to CVE-2016-10724.

The alert system in itself also creates a centralized source in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has since deprecated the alert system entirely.
Bitcoin has also released a patch for the alert vulnerability which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/achow101/02d03238090691558a68010a9ccbbf9d)

The code relevant to these vulnerabilities can be found in the file `alert.cpp` of Bitcoin 0.12.X.
This specific file can be found [here](https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension/blob/master/CVE-2016-10724/Bitcoin-0.12.X/alert.cpp).

# Absolute Core 0.14.0.1

Products designed by you. Create and configure your own items with the option to log your creation on the Absolute blockchain.

Our goal is to allow you to produce excellent quality products that are designed by you using our online configurator. Certain designs have the choice of being recorded in the Absolute blockchain, allow independent verification that the design you made is unique to you.

Find out more about Absolute: <https://absify.me/>

The One Protocol is Absolutes goal aiming for there only to be one ABS left in circulation. Although this is unlikely due to the mechanics of supply and demand, it allows us to reward you by reducing supply based on the performance of our business. This makes your holdings absolute more valuable.

On a monthly basis we take 10% of our profit margin to buy and then destroy those collected ABS. This destroyed ABS is sent to specific addresses which are then closed off and hardcoded into the system to make sure that they are never used again. We then use these addresses to offset the max supply calculations.

Find out more about the One Protocol: <https://absify.me/one-protocol/>

Absolute runs a Governance system maintained by LLMQ based Masternodes which can be serviced via: <http://proposal.absify.me/>

10% Of blockchain rewards are dedicated to our governance system, these super blocks are issued once per week.

## Development Process

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/absolute-community/absolute/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Absolute Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Testing

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

## Translations

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Absolute Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/absolute/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](/absolute-community/absolute/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

## About
