The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10226.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how JavaScriptCore's parser handles the `async` keyword. Specifically, when `async` is followed by an identifier in a context where a member expression is expected, the parser incorrectly returns 0 instead of reporting an error. This leads to the parser misinterpreting the `async` keyword as a unary operator, resulting in a crash due to an out-of-bounds read when `operatorString()` is called. Furthermore, some keyword tokens could also be misinterpreted as unary operators due to bitfield limitations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of the `async` keyword in member expression contexts.
- Insufficient bits allocated for token types, causing keyword tokens to be treated as unary operators due to bitfield overflow.
- Lack of proper error handling in the parser when `async` is followed by an identifier.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A crash due to an out-of-bounds read, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can occur by providing specially crafted JavaScript code containing the `async` keyword followed by an identifier where a member expression is expected such as "0/-async J".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable JavaScriptCore environment.
