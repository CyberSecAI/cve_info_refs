Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `xtrlock` program, designed to lock an X display, did not properly block multitouch events. It was only grabbing the "core pointer" and not individual input devices that might be used for multitouch input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Blocking:** `xtrlock` failed to intercept and block input from multitouch devices, such as touchscreens and touchpads, beyond the primary mouse pointer.
*   **Lack of Device Enumeration:** It did not enumerate over all available input devices to apply the lock, leading to a bypass via other input methods.
*   **New device handling**: `xtrlock` did not handle devices plugged in after the lock has been initiated

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Control of Applications:** An attacker with physical access to a locked computer could send input to applications, like Chromium, through multitouch gestures (e.g., pinch-to-zoom, pan scrolling) or simulated mouse clicks using multiple fingers on a trackpad/touchscreen.
*   **Circumvention of Screen Lock:** The security measure (screen lock) provided by `xtrlock` could be bypassed.
*   **Manipulation of Application Settings:** Attackers could potentially change settings within vulnerable applications (like Chromium) while the system is supposedly locked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the target machine to interact with its input devices.
*   **Multitouch Input:** The attack uses a multitouch device like a touchscreen or a touchpad.
*   **Specific Applications:** Some applications, like Chromium, might be more susceptible because they are configured to process multitouch events or lack window decorations, making them vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have physical access to the locked computer.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to use multitouch gestures to control applications.
*   The attacker needs to be able to use multiple fingers on a touch interface or touchpad.
* If a device is plugged in after the lock is active it may not be blocked

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2016-10894.
*   The fix involves enumerating and grabbing all multitouch devices using the X Input Extension (XInput2).
*   There was discussion of the issue of a potential attacker being able to plug in a multitouch device after `xtrlock` was started, which was not fixed due to no input from upstream.
*   The bug report includes discussions between the reporter, maintainer and other parties on various aspects of the fix including handling of dynamically plugged in devices.
* The fix for this issue does not prevent circumvention if an attacker plugs in a new multitouch device *after* the screen has been locked.
* Some discussion around a timing attack for enabling input devices during `xtrlock` execution was investigated.
