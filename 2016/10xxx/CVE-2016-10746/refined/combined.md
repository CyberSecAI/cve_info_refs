We have a policy that if API may end up talking to a guest agent
it should require RW connection. We don't obey the rule in
virDomainGetTime().

Hash: SHA256

Package        : libvirt
Version        : 1.2.9-9+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-10746

libvirt-domain.c in libvirt supports virDomainGetTime API calls by guest agents
with an RO connection, even though an RW connection was supposed to be
required.  This could lead to could lead to potentially disclosing unintended
information or denial of service by causing libvirt to block.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.9-9+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
