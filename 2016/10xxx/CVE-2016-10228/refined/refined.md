{
  "CVE-2016-10228": {
    "Description": "The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect parsing of '//' marked suffixes in the iconv program. The second suffix is dropped during parsing. When '//ignore' suffix is not picked up, the program enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service. The iconv program hangs (enters an infinite loop), becoming unresponsive and consuming resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Invoking the iconv program with crafted input and specific options.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the iconv program with a crafted input sequence and specific options. User interaction may be necessary to cause the hang."
