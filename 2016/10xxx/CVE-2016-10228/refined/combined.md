## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c0)  Jan Engelhardt    2016-01-25 18:41:47 UTC  ``` In glibc 2.19 and glibc 2.22, I observe that combining //translit with //ignore with -c with an unconvertible sequence will hang the iconv program. The order of //translit and //ignore is significant. The target charset is of no significance; it could also be -t utf-8//translit//ignore.   echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c1)  Florian Weimer    2016-01-26 13:09:51 UTC  ``` Thanks for reporting this.  I tested a glibc based on 2.12 upstream, without any of the gconv fixes from the last years, and the problem is still there.  This does not look like a regression. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c2)  Florian Weimer    2017-03-01 09:12:56 UTC  ``` Another reproducer:  echo -en "\x0e\x0e" | /usr/bin/iconv -c -f IBM1364  We received an independent report of this issue, and I think we should treat this as a minor security bug. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c3)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 07:57:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 9875](attachment.cgi?id=9875&action=diff "attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=9875&action=edit "attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228") attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228  This is my attempt to fix that bug by advancing the buffer whenever an illegal character is detected by one byte. While this does fix the specific examples in this bug report I am not sure whether it is a good idea since I am not particularly deep in that code.  Concerns that come to my mind and should be commented upon by someone that is more familiar with that code: 1. Is the place I fixed here the only place that needs fixing or did I probably miss other places. 2. Is advancing by one byte generally a good idea? Some character sets operate on multiple byte characters. Do we need to consider this here and probably advance with the character size instead? Is there information available in some data structure about how many bytes we would need to advance? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c4)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 08:11:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 9876](attachment.cgi?id=9876&action=diff "Add missing brackets.")

Is advancing by one byte generally a good idea?  In case where each codepoint is known to be encoded as the same number of bytes, e.g. 4 octets in UTF-32, I would expect it to advance by that stride.  echo -en '\xff\xff\xff\xff' | iconv -f utf-32 -t utf-32//translit//ignore -c ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c6)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 10:27:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Engelhardt from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c5)) > >2.

Thus next task is to find a way to determine within that context the size of each code point in bytes. This might probably be a bit difficult given that this knowledge seems to be totally encapsulated within the iconv function call. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c7)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-16 08:03:53 UTC  ``` Ok, I experimented quite a bit to figure out the minimal number of bytes used to encode a code point but it seems I didn't really fully understand the underlying data structure and so far didn't find a working solution for all cases I tested.  Therefore for my own purposes I left the solution advancing one byte, leaving the risk that for some encodings the output can contain even more garbage than what was found in the input, following the concept "garbage in, garbage out". At least it still avoids the tool to hang in those cases.  I leave it to the experts of this code area to improve this fix or provide me a hint, where in the data structures I can find the information about what is the smallest number of bytes for one code point in the input data encoding. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c8)  Shane Seymour    2017-04-06 08:33:45 UTC  ``` I thought I'd chime in since I believe the independent report mentioned by Florian was from me.  Although it's not a generic fix for the underlying issue for a class of character sets that use shift in/shift out sequences (e.g. IBM930 and IBM933) some of them work as expected and some don't (I can't remember which one did ignore a duplicate shift in or out). For IBM930 the BODY macro looks in part like:  #define BODY \   {                                                                           \     uint32_t ch = *inptr;                                                     \     uint32_t res;                                                             \                                                                               \     if (__builtin_expect (ch, 0) == SO)                                       \       {                                                                       \         /* Shift OUT, change to DBCS converter.  */                           \         if (curcs == db)                                                      \           {                                                                   \             result = __GCONV_ILLEGAL_INPUT;                                   \             break;                                                            \           }                                                                   \         curcs = db;                                                           \         ++inptr;                                                              \         continue;                                                             \       }                                                                       \  if this line:          if (curcs == db)                                                      \  was changed to:          if (curcs == db && (! ignore_errors_p ()))                            \  Then a duplicate shift out sequence in IBM930 would not cause the iconv command to loop forever with the -c option (the shift in code needs the same change).   But in general the issue could be resolved up by the code that does the conversions not returning an error when being told ignore errors. In the above example while it appears to be illegal to have duplicate shift in/out sequences when ignoring errors the duplicate should probably just be consumed and ignored.  Should there be a general rule that the character set conversion macros must do something with their input when faced with something invalid and they've been told to ignore errors? Then iconv doesn't need to know anything when set to ignore errors and it shouldn't loop.  For non-variable size multi-byte character sets the converter at least it knows based on the character set the number of bytes it should consume so it's easier for it to skip past any error (e.g. IBM930 knows if it should skip one or two bytes based on the current shift state).   I thought of these general rules when errors are ignored:  1. Character set converters using a fixed or know number of bytes will skip forward one character when encountering an invalid character (includes character sets that are always the one fixed size and character sets using shift states between different size fixed characters) 2. Invalid structural data will be consumed (e.g. duplicate shift in/out states in character sets like IBM930) 3. Variable size character sets will consume everything in from the start of a character up to and including the byte that made the character invalid (e.g. in SJIS if the sequence of bytes 0x81 0x20 was seen both bytes would be consumed not just the 0x81 but that could instead easily be advance one byte and start again).  Those rules are entirely open to discussion though - I've probably missed some conditions that need to be covered. The downside would be that there are a lot of macros to review to make sure that they would all follow a defined set of rules and may it change their behaviour.  Anything following a conversion failure should really be considered undefined anyway (as someone else said garbage in garbage out) so how bad data gets treated can follow set rules as long as they are followed consistently by everything.  Does it make more sense that the character set converters should decide what to drop, skip or quitely consume when being told to ignore errors vs doing it somewhere that doesn't really know much about any particular character set? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c9)  Shane Seymour    2017-04-06 23:35:24 UTC  ``` Sorry I should add that the IBM930 example was just that (an example). That's an illustration of a downstream issue not upstream since that code has been changed for that conversion to ignore duplicate shift in shift out characters. The same general class of issues exists in other things though. Should the conversion routines be allowed to return errors when told to ignore them (or if they do they can't return with the input pointer unchanged so forward progress can always be guaranteed). ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c10)  Florian Weimer    2017-05-08 05:25:19 UTC  ``` Perhaps we should do the following:  (1) -c should add //IGNORE to the conversions if not already there.  (2) The conversion functions should be adjusted to make progress in //IGNORE.  See [bug 13541](show_bug.cgi?id=13541 "NEW - iconv //IGNORE charsets are inconsistent about INBUF* state after EILSEQ").  (3) If the iconv function does not make progress, skip over individual input bytes.  With (2), this is only used as a last resort, to avoid a hang.   We can probably implement (1) and (3) for this bug.  (2) is mostly a charset-specific quality issue after that.  Even then, the scope of this bug is a bit larger than what I expected. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c11)  Arjun Shankar    2017-06-22 13:52:30 UTC  ``` > echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c > echo -en "\x0e\x0e" | /usr/bin/iconv -c -f IBM1364  I have not investigated the second reproducer, but I am quite sure that it is completely unrelated to the first one.  The first one is caused by incorrect parsing of the "//" marked suffixes (//translit and //ignore). The problem is that the second suffix is being dropped when parsing. This is why the order matters. The case reported, i.e.:  $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c  is one where the "//translit" suffix is actually irrelevant because the input does not have characters that can/should be transliterated, but its presence as the first suffix leads to the actually relevant "//ignore" suffix (0x80 is not valid ASCII) being *ignored* by iconv, leading to a hang.  This is why, these four similar cases:  $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//ignore//translit -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//ignore -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit -c  do not hang. The '//ignore' suffix being first (or implied via -c) gets picked up by the program and it correctly outputs nothing, and  the "//translit", if present, is dropped (incorrectly) - but this has no effect for this particular input on the program's running because like I mentioned earlier: there is nothing to be transliterated in the input. Note that '-c' actually appends the "//ignore" to the target encoding suffix if no suffixes are present, and ",ignore" if one or more suffixes are already present. If two suffixes are passed during input, then the ',ignore' appended because of '-c' will get dropped along with the second suffix, which may or may not lead to hang depending on whether the first suffix is //ignore.  The hang in case of a missing "//ignore" suffix (well, not really missing here but ignored by the program) afterwards during execution is a separate problem (that I haven't investigated).  I'm going to write a patch to fix the problem with the parsing at the right place(s), and then tackle the hangs separately. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c12)  Arjun Shankar    2017-06-22 14:05:14 UTC  ``` I quickly want to point out that passing an input character that requires transliteration and then passing //translit as the second suffix also leads to erroneous program behaviour (it reports an error instead of performing transliteration). Some test cases:  Exits successfully with 'A' written to stdout (because //translit is the only or first suffix):  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//translit" $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//translit//ignore"  No transliteration and corresponding "illegal input sequence" error thrown, even though //translit is passed, but it is incorrectly ignored by the program because it is not the first suffix:  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//ignore//translit"  Exits without error messages but (incorrectly) writes nothing to stdout. This is because 'translit' got ignored (2nd suffix), but '-c' leads to silently dropping the input character that wasn't transliterated:  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//ignore//translit" -c ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c13)  Arjun Shankar    2019-05-21 11:06:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11786](attachment.cgi?id=11786 "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=11786&action=edit "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8") Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8  I wrote a bash script that tests every possible 2-byte conversion from every supported charset to UTF-8.

Subject: CVE-2016-10228: glibc iconv program can hang when invoked with the -c
 option

The iconv program (not the iconv function) provided by glibc can hang
(enter an infinite loop) when invoked with the -c option and an invalid
multi-byte sequence is encountered in the input:

   <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19519>

We have received an independent report of this issue, so we are treating
this as a (minor) security bug now on the glibc upstream side.

(Note to Red Hat Product Security: We already have a couple of product
bugs for this.)

Thanks,
Florian

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c0)  Jan Engelhardt    2016-01-25 18:41:47 UTC  ``` In glibc 2.19 and glibc 2.22, I observe that combining //translit with //ignore with -c with an unconvertible sequence will hang the iconv program. The order of //translit and //ignore is significant. The target charset is of no significance; it could also be -t utf-8//translit//ignore.   echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c1)  Florian Weimer    2016-01-26 13:09:51 UTC  ``` Thanks for reporting this.  I tested a glibc based on 2.12 upstream, without any of the gconv fixes from the last years, and the problem is still there.  This does not look like a regression. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c2)  Florian Weimer    2017-03-01 09:12:56 UTC  ``` Another reproducer:  echo -en "\x0e\x0e" | /usr/bin/iconv -c -f IBM1364  We received an independent report of this issue, and I think we should treat this as a minor security bug. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c3)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 07:57:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 9875](attachment.cgi?id=9875&action=diff "attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=9875&action=edit "attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228") attempt to fix CVE-2016-10228  This is my attempt to fix that bug by advancing the buffer whenever an illegal character is detected by one byte. While this does fix the specific examples in this bug report I am not sure whether it is a good idea since I am not particularly deep in that code.  Concerns that come to my mind and should be commented upon by someone that is more familiar with that code: 1. Is the place I fixed here the only place that needs fixing or did I probably miss other places. 2. Is advancing by one byte generally a good idea? Some character sets operate on multiple byte characters. Do we need to consider this here and probably advance with the character size instead? Is there information available in some data structure about how many bytes we would need to advance? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c4)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 08:11:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 9876](attachment.cgi?id=9876&action=diff "Add missing brackets.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=9876&action=edit "Add missing brackets.") Add missing brackets.  Sorry, the indention style tricked me into missing the brackets before. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c5)  Jan Engelhardt    2017-03-07 08:56:51 UTC  ``` >2. Is advancing by one byte generally a good idea?  In case where each codepoint is known to be encoded as the same number of bytes, e.g. 4 octets in UTF-32, I would expect it to advance by that stride.  echo -en '\xff\xff\xff\xff' | iconv -f utf-32 -t utf-32//translit//ignore -c ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c6)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-07 10:27:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Engelhardt from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c5)) > >2. Is advancing by one byte generally a good idea? >  > In case where each codepoint is known to be encoded as the same number of > bytes, e.g. 4 octets in UTF-32, I would expect it to advance by that stride. >  > echo -en '\xff\xff\xff\xff' | iconv -f utf-32 -t utf-32//translit//ignore -c  Exactly such a case I had in mind with my concern. Thus next task is to find a way to determine within that context the size of each code point in bytes. This might probably be a bit difficult given that this knowledge seems to be totally encapsulated within the iconv function call. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c7)  Robert Schiele    2017-03-16 08:03:53 UTC  ``` Ok, I experimented quite a bit to figure out the minimal number of bytes used to encode a code point but it seems I didn't really fully understand the underlying data structure and so far didn't find a working solution for all cases I tested.  Therefore for my own purposes I left the solution advancing one byte, leaving the risk that for some encodings the output can contain even more garbage than what was found in the input, following the concept "garbage in, garbage out". At least it still avoids the tool to hang in those cases.  I leave it to the experts of this code area to improve this fix or provide me a hint, where in the data structures I can find the information about what is the smallest number of bytes for one code point in the input data encoding. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c8)  Shane Seymour    2017-04-06 08:33:45 UTC  ``` I thought I'd chime in since I believe the independent report mentioned by Florian was from me.  Although it's not a generic fix for the underlying issue for a class of character sets that use shift in/shift out sequences (e.g. IBM930 and IBM933) some of them work as expected and some don't (I can't remember which one did ignore a duplicate shift in or out). For IBM930 the BODY macro looks in part like:  #define BODY \   {                                                                           \     uint32_t ch = *inptr;                                                     \     uint32_t res;                                                             \                                                                               \     if (__builtin_expect (ch, 0) == SO)                                       \       {                                                                       \         /* Shift OUT, change to DBCS converter.  */                           \         if (curcs == db)                                                      \           {                                                                   \             result = __GCONV_ILLEGAL_INPUT;                                   \             break;                                                            \           }                                                                   \         curcs = db;                                                           \         ++inptr;                                                              \         continue;                                                             \       }                                                                       \  if this line:          if (curcs == db)                                                      \  was changed to:          if (curcs == db && (! ignore_errors_p ()))                            \  Then a duplicate shift out sequence in IBM930 would not cause the iconv command to loop forever with the -c option (the shift in code needs the same change).   But in general the issue could be resolved up by the code that does the conversions not returning an error when being told ignore errors. In the above example while it appears to be illegal to have duplicate shift in/out sequences when ignoring errors the duplicate should probably just be consumed and ignored.  Should there be a general rule that the character set conversion macros must do something with their input when faced with something invalid and they've been told to ignore errors? Then iconv doesn't need to know anything when set to ignore errors and it shouldn't loop.  For non-variable size multi-byte character sets the converter at least it knows based on the character set the number of bytes it should consume so it's easier for it to skip past any error (e.g. IBM930 knows if it should skip one or two bytes based on the current shift state).   I thought of these general rules when errors are ignored:  1. Character set converters using a fixed or know number of bytes will skip forward one character when encountering an invalid character (includes character sets that are always the one fixed size and character sets using shift states between different size fixed characters) 2. Invalid structural data will be consumed (e.g. duplicate shift in/out states in character sets like IBM930) 3. Variable size character sets will consume everything in from the start of a character up to and including the byte that made the character invalid (e.g. in SJIS if the sequence of bytes 0x81 0x20 was seen both bytes would be consumed not just the 0x81 but that could instead easily be advance one byte and start again).  Those rules are entirely open to discussion though - I've probably missed some conditions that need to be covered. The downside would be that there are a lot of macros to review to make sure that they would all follow a defined set of rules and may it change their behaviour.  Anything following a conversion failure should really be considered undefined anyway (as someone else said garbage in garbage out) so how bad data gets treated can follow set rules as long as they are followed consistently by everything.  Does it make more sense that the character set converters should decide what to drop, skip or quitely consume when being told to ignore errors vs doing it somewhere that doesn't really know much about any particular character set? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c9)  Shane Seymour    2017-04-06 23:35:24 UTC  ``` Sorry I should add that the IBM930 example was just that (an example). That's an illustration of a downstream issue not upstream since that code has been changed for that conversion to ignore duplicate shift in shift out characters. The same general class of issues exists in other things though. Should the conversion routines be allowed to return errors when told to ignore them (or if they do they can't return with the input pointer unchanged so forward progress can always be guaranteed). ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c10)  Florian Weimer    2017-05-08 05:25:19 UTC  ``` Perhaps we should do the following:  (1) -c should add //IGNORE to the conversions if not already there.  (2) The conversion functions should be adjusted to make progress in //IGNORE.  See [bug 13541](show_bug.cgi?id=13541 "NEW - iconv //IGNORE charsets are inconsistent about INBUF* state after EILSEQ").  (3) If the iconv function does not make progress, skip over individual input bytes.  With (2), this is only used as a last resort, to avoid a hang.   We can probably implement (1) and (3) for this bug.  (2) is mostly a charset-specific quality issue after that.  Even then, the scope of this bug is a bit larger than what I expected. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c11)  Arjun Shankar    2017-06-22 13:52:30 UTC  ``` > echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c > echo -en "\x0e\x0e" | /usr/bin/iconv -c -f IBM1364  I have not investigated the second reproducer, but I am quite sure that it is completely unrelated to the first one.  The first one is caused by incorrect parsing of the "//" marked suffixes (//translit and //ignore). The problem is that the second suffix is being dropped when parsing. This is why the order matters. The case reported, i.e.:  $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit//ignore -c  is one where the "//translit" suffix is actually irrelevant because the input does not have characters that can/should be transliterated, but its presence as the first suffix leads to the actually relevant "//ignore" suffix (0x80 is not valid ASCII) being *ignored* by iconv, leading to a hang.  This is why, these four similar cases:  $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//ignore//translit -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//ignore -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii -c $ echo -en '\x80' | iconv -f us-ascii -t us-ascii//translit -c  do not hang. The '//ignore' suffix being first (or implied via -c) gets picked up by the program and it correctly outputs nothing, and  the "//translit", if present, is dropped (incorrectly) - but this has no effect for this particular input on the program's running because like I mentioned earlier: there is nothing to be transliterated in the input. Note that '-c' actually appends the "//ignore" to the target encoding suffix if no suffixes are present, and ",ignore" if one or more suffixes are already present. If two suffixes are passed during input, then the ',ignore' appended because of '-c' will get dropped along with the second suffix, which may or may not lead to hang depending on whether the first suffix is //ignore.  The hang in case of a missing "//ignore" suffix (well, not really missing here but ignored by the program) afterwards during execution is a separate problem (that I haven't investigated).  I'm going to write a patch to fix the problem with the parsing at the right place(s), and then tackle the hangs separately. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c12)  Arjun Shankar    2017-06-22 14:05:14 UTC  ``` I quickly want to point out that passing an input character that requires transliteration and then passing //translit as the second suffix also leads to erroneous program behaviour (it reports an error instead of performing transliteration). Some test cases:  Exits successfully with 'A' written to stdout (because //translit is the only or first suffix):  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//translit" $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//translit//ignore"  No transliteration and corresponding "illegal input sequence" error thrown, even though //translit is passed, but it is incorrectly ignored by the program because it is not the first suffix:  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//ignore//translit"  Exits without error messages but (incorrectly) writes nothing to stdout. This is because 'translit' got ignored (2nd suffix), but '-c' leads to silently dropping the input character that wasn't transliterated:  $ echo -en '\xc3\x81' | iconv -f utf8 -t "us-ascii//ignore//translit" -c ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=19519#c13)  Arjun Shankar    2019-05-21 11:06:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 11786](attachment.cgi?id=11786 "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=11786&action=edit "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8") Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8  I wrote a bash script that tests every possible 2-byte conversion from every supported charset to UTF-8.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=26224#c0)  Arjun Shankar    2020-07-09 20:21:51 UTC  ``` I found the following hangs when running an iconv input fuzzer I wrote while trying to fix [bug 19519](show_bug.cgi?id=19519 "RESOLVED FIXED - iconv(1) with -c option hangs on illegal multi-byte sequences (CVE-2016-10228)"). The hangs are present in master:  echo -en '\x00\x0f' | iconv -t UTF-8 -c -f IBM1364 echo -en '\x00\x0f' | iconv -t UTF-8 -c -f IBM1371 echo -en '\x00\x0f' | iconv -t UTF-8 -c -f IBM1388 echo -en '\x00\x0f' | iconv -t UTF-8 -c -f IBM1390 echo -en '\x00\x0f' | iconv -t UTF-8 -c -f IBM1399  These hangs are presently mentioned but commented out in iconv/tst-iconv_prog.sh and should eventually be un-commented when this bug is fixed.  The fuzzer itself ([attachment 11786](attachment.cgi?id=11786 "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=11786&action=edit "Test to perform every possible 2-byte conversion from all charsets to UTF-8")) should also be run against these character sets after this bug is fixed, because they skip all remaining inputs for a character set once they encounter a hang in the corresponding converter, and thus any other hangs (from possibly other bugs) aren't tested for. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=26224#c1)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2020-11-06 02:19:15 UTC  ``` Fixed by:  commit 9a99c682144bdbd40792ebf822fe9264e0376fb5 Author: Arjun Shankar <arjun@redhat.com> Date:   Wed Nov 4 12:19:38 2020 +0100      iconv: Accept redundant shift sequences in IBM1364 [BZ #26224]          The IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390 and IBM1399 character sets     share converter logic (iconvdata/ibm1364.c) which would reject     redundant shift sequences when processing input in these character     sets.  This led to a hang in the iconv program (CVE-2020-27618).          This commit adjusts the converter to ignore redundant shift sequences     and adds test cases for iconv_prog hangs that would be triggered upon     their rejection.  This brings the implementation in line with other     converters that also ignore redundant shift sequences (e.g. IBM930     etc., fixed in commit 692de4b3960d).

                 983479 989147 990542

This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
affects character set conversion.

CVE-2016-10228

    The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
    suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
    the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2019-19126

    On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
    LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
    execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
    restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
    thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

CVE-2019-25013

    The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
    over-read.

CVE-2020-10029

    The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
    reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
    non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
    0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
    to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

CVE-2020-1752

    A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
    way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
    an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
    issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
    specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
    would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2020-27618

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
    and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
    lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
    service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

CVE-2020-6096

    An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
    memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
    targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
    value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
    vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
    memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
    writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
    execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
    program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
    or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
    execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
    corrupted data.

CVE-2021-27645

    The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
    processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
    double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
    Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

CVE-2021-3326

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
    the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-33574

    The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
    may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
    its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
    leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
    unspecified other impact.

CVE-2021-35942

    The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
    memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
    untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
    service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
    used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

CVE-2021-3999

    An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
    memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
    attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
    in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
    arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

CVE-2022-23218

    The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
    module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
    without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
    is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2022-23219

    The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
    of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
    validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
    not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.28-10+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.
