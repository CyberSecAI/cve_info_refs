## Description

WP Editor is a plugin for WordPress that replaces the default plugin and theme editors as well as the page/post editor. Using integrations with CodeMirror and FancyBox to create a feature rich environment, WP Editor completely reworks the default WordPress file editing capabilities. Using Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) to retrieve files and folders, WP Editor sets a new standard for speed and reliability in a web-based editing atmosphere.

#### Features:

* CodeMirror
* Active Line Highlighting
* Line Numbers
* Line Wrapping
* Eight Editor Themes with Syntax Highlighting
* Fullscreen Editing (ESC, F11)
* Text Search (CMD + F, CTRL + F)
* Individual Settings for Each Editor
* FancyBox for image viewing
* AJAX File Browser
* Allowed Extensions List
* Easy to use Settings Section

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-editor.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

## FAQ

### Does WP Editor provide syntax highlighting for the page/post editor?

Yes! This feature was added in version 1.1 of WP Editor. If it’s not enabled by default, visit the settings page, click on the “Post Editor” section and enable it there.

### Can I search for text within a file?

Yes! Just use the key combination, CTRL + F or CMD + F and it will open up a search dialog box that will allow you to type in a search string.

### Does WP Editor have a fullscreen mode?

Yes! Just hit the Esc key or click on the fullscreen button on the post editor and it will take the editor to the full size of the browser.

### I don’t like the active line highlighting in the editor, can I disable this?

Yes! Just visit the settings page and you can disable the active line highlighting there.

### A file type that my theme uses is not supported by WP Editor, how can I get it added?

If there is a filetype that is not supported by WP Editor, just visit the [WP Editor support page](http://wpeditor.net/support) and fill out the support form. We will do our best to include it by the next release.

### My custom quicktags don’t work with WP Editor, why not?

WP Editor uses a custom method for creating quicktags to get them to work with the update. If you use a specific quicktag that is not supported, fill out our [support form](http://wpeditor.net/support) and we will try to implement it as soon as possible.

### Is WP Editor better than the competition?

Yes! Well, we like to think so. If there is a feature that another plugin has that you think WP Editor should include, let us know. We will do our best to add it in to the plugin!

### I love WP Editor! Can I help somehow?

Yes! While we don’t have a need for further developers at this time, any financial contributions are welcome! Just visit the [WP Editor](http://wpeditor.net) website and click on the donate link, and thank you!

I tried several plugins, but the WP-Editor is the only valid, ready to use and simple solution. It works on PHP5+. Thanks to author! Also, it works together with WP Bakery Visual Composer (no conflict)!
===
Единственный плагин для подсветки HTML-кода в редакторе, который работает как надо “из коробки”. В том числе на PHP5 (некоторые требуют PHP7), и параллельно с WP Bakery Visual Composer (они не конфликтуют). И, в отличие от ещё одного плагина, здесь не создаётся ещё одна вкладка в дополение к двум (Визуально / Текст), а подсвечивается код именно во вкладке “Текст”. То, что мне и нужно было!
