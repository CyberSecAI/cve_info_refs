Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10764:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The commit `193e87143c290ec16838f5368adc0e0bc94eb931`, specifically mentioned in the provided content, is directly related to the fix for an off-by-one error described by CVE-2016-10764.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect bounds check in the `cqspi_setup_flash()` function within the `drivers/mtd/spi-nor/cadence-quadspi.c` file of the Linux kernel. The code used `>` instead of `>=` when comparing the chip select value (`cs`) against `CQSPI_MAX_CHIPSELECT`, which is the maximum number of chip selects. This off-by-one error would allow the code to potentially access memory beyond the allocated array.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is an **incorrect bounds check**, which is a common programming error. This allows the program to attempt to access a memory location outside the intended boundaries, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.

*   **Impact:** While the content does not explicitly state the impact of this specific vulnerability, an off-by-one error in memory access could lead to several issues:
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Writing data to an unintended memory location could corrupt data structures, leading to unpredictable behavior or a system crash.
    *   **Denial of Service:** A crash could result in a denial-of-service condition as the affected service or the whole system becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** In some scenarios, memory corruption issues can become an entry point for more severe exploits such as code injection.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability lies within the Cadence Quad SPI flash controller driver. The attack vector would involve providing a chip select value (`cs`) that is equal to  `CQSPI_MAX_CHIPSELECT` causing the incorrect check to pass but the code to access an invalid location.

*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would likely need some control or influence over the device tree or platform data to manipulate the value of `cs`. This usually means the attacker would need to be in a position to control or modify the kernel boot process or have root access.

**3. Additional Details**

*   The patch fixes the off-by-one error by changing the condition from `cs > CQSPI_MAX_CHIPSELECT` to `cs >= CQSPI_MAX_CHIPSELECT`.
*   The commit message also references the commit that introduced the bug `140623410536 ('mtd: spi-nor: Add driver for Cadence Quad SPI Flash Controller')`.
*   The fix was authored by Dan Carpenter, reviewed by Marek Vasut and signed-off by Cyrille Pitchen.

**4. Summary:**

CVE-2016-10764 describes an off-by-one error in the Cadence Quad SPI Flash Controller driver within the Linux kernel. The incorrect bounds check (using `> ` instead of `>=`) in the `cqspi_setup_flash()` function could lead to potential memory corruption issues and system instability. The provided content contains the patch that addresses this vulnerability.
