# Path Traversal Attack Security Vulnerability

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of the path traversal attack vulnerability (also known as directory traversal, dot-dot-lash, directory climbing, and backtracking) that an attacker can use to access every file and directory on a system stored outside the web root folder.

This software vulnerability affects the following NETGEAR products:

* FVS336Gv3
* FVS318N
* FVS318Gv2
* SRX5308

NETGEAR strongly recommends that you upgrade to the latest firmware, version 4.3.3-8 that eliminates the path traversal attack security vulnerability. To install firmware v4.3.3-8, click the link to your product support page and follow the Installation Instructions:

* Product Model Number: FVS336Gv3

  ProSAFE Dual WAN Gigabit Firewall with SSL & IPSec VPN

  <https://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30722>

* Product Model Number: FVS318N

  ProSAFE Wireless N VPN Firewall

  <https://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30721>

* Product Model Number: FVS318Gv2

  ProSAFE VPN Firewall Series

  <https://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30720>

* Product Model Number: SRX5308

  ProSAFE Quad WAN Gigabit SSL VPN Firewall

  <https://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30719>

The potential for the path traversal attack vulnerability remains if you do not update the firmware as recommended in this notification. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.

NETGEAR emails firmware updates to all registered users as firmware becomes available. To register your product, visit <https://my.netgear.com/register/>.

NETGEAR will update this KB article as more information becomes available.
