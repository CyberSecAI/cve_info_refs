**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of style attributes in HTML tags by OWASP AntiSamy. By crafting a specific input with a tag that supports style with active content, an attacker could bypass the library's protections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization
- Failure to properly validate style attributes
- Insufficient filtering of active content in style attributes

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be launched remotely.
- Input: The vulnerability is triggered by providing malicious HTML input to the AntiSamy library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges or specific user interaction beyond submitting crafted input.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input to an application using the vulnerable version of AntiSamy.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of OWASP AntiSamy prior to 1.5.5.
- The issue was reported by Vivek Krishna from Zoho Corporation.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a moderate severity with a CVSS v3 score of 6.1.
- The EPSS score indicates a low probability (0.089%) of exploitation within the next 30 days.

The issue is tracked in the AntiSamy GitHub repository as issue #2.
