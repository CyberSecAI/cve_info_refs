Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10330:

**CVE Description:**

The Synology advisory indicates that CVE-2016-10330 is related to a vulnerability in Synology Photo Station that allows an attacker to copy files via unauthorized access.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Vulnerability 2: Privilege Escalation:**  The root cause is an insecure use of a setuid binary (`/var/packages/PhotoStation/target/bin/synophoto_dsm_user`). This binary is owned by root and has the setuid bit set, meaning it runs with root privileges when executed.  It's used to copy files and is exploitable via the `--copy-no-ea` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation via Setuid Binary:**  The `synophoto_dsm_user` binary allows an unprivileged user (http) to copy files to arbitrary locations due to its setuid permissions. This enables attackers to overwrite system files (like `/etc/crontab`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution as Root:** By overwriting `/etc/crontab` with malicious content, an attacker can schedule arbitrary commands to run with root privileges. This allows for complete system takeover.
*   **Unauthorized File Copying**:  The advisory states that this vulnerability allows an attacker to copy files via unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (after initial command injection):** After gaining initial access via the command injection vulnerability described in the same posting (though related to CVE-2016-10329, not this CVE), an attacker can leverage the setuid binary to escalate privileges. The initial command injection is not necessary to exploit this vulnerability, the setuid binary is exploitable even if the attacker has basic http level access.
*   **Exploitation of Setuid Binary:** The attacker can call `synophoto_dsm_user` with the `--copy-no-ea` option to copy a file they control to a privileged location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial http user access (potentially through command injection or other means):** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands as the `http` user (UID 1023). This could be achieved by exploiting the command injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10329) or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to write to a location controlled by the http user:** An attacker must be able to create/modify a file, like `/tmp/hack2`, which can then be used as a source to copy via the setuid binary.
