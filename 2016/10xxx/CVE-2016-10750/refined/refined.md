Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-10750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **untrusted Java deserialization** within the Hazelcast cluster join procedure.  Hazelcast blindly deserializes objects received in the `JoinRequest` stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:**  The core issue is that Hazelcast doesn't validate or sanitize the data it's deserializing during the cluster join process. This allows an attacker to send malicious serialized Java objects.
*   **Pre-authentication:** This vulnerability is exploitable before authentication since the `JoinRequest` is what implements the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Hazelcast server.  This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary Shell Commands:** The attacker can run shell commands, potentially taking full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector requires the attacker to have network access to a listening Hazelcast instance.
*   **Crafted JoinRequest:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious `JoinRequest` containing the exploit payload as a serialized Java object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the Hazelcast instance.
*   **Knowledge of Java Serialization:** The attacker must be capable of creating malicious serialized Java objects that exploit known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*  **Vulnerable Classes on Classpath**: The attacker needs to have exploitable classes that are present on the classpath of the Hazelcast server.

**Mitigation:**
The provided github content shows the process of adding a blacklist/whitelist filter for deserialization, which was the ultimate fix.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The github content shows the discussion and implementation of a fix involving blacklisting and whitelisting of classes for deserialization. It also documents the performance concerns raised and the testing done to address them.
*   The redhat bugzilla and errata content indicate that this vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0.
* The vulnerability affects Hazelcast before version 3.11.
