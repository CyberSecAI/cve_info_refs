### Untrusted deserialization protection for Hazelcast

This pull request introduces java deserialization protection based on class names blacklisting and whitelisting.

The new feature is controlled by a new section in Hazelcast serialization configuration. The feature is not enabled by default, you can enable it by adding `<java-serialization-filter/>` element into `<serialization/>` configuration section.

**Example:**

```
<hazelcast>
    <serialization>
        <java-serialization-filter>
            <whitelist>
                <class>java.lang.String</class>
                <class>example.Foo</class>
                <package>com.acme.app</package>
                <package>com.acme.app.subpkg</package>
            </whitelist>
            <blacklist>
                <class>com.acme.app.BeanComparator</class>
            </blacklist>
        </java-serialization-filter>
    </serialization>
</hazelcast>
```

Once the feature is enabled, following filtering rules are used when objects are deserialized.

**Filtering rules**

* When whitelist is not provided:
  1. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is blacklisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is blacklisted, then deserialization fails;
  2. deserialization is allowed otherwise.
* When whitelist is provided:
  1. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is blacklisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is blacklisted, then deserialization fails;
  2. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is whitelisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is whitelisted, then deserialization is allowed;
  3. deserialization fails otherwise.

Failed deserialization means a `SecurityException` is thrown.

When the blacklist is not explicitly provided, a default hardcoded value with some well known vulnerable class names is used.

The safest way to protect against untrusted deserialization is to use whitelisting, nevertheless it's also hard to maintain such a whitelist.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I'm not sure about the config style, but this is already discussed in Slack, so we can see what the outcome is there.

I'm also not sure about the configuration parsing and check order. If I read the code correctly, the `DEFAULT_BLACKLIST` is overwritten as soon as I define a blacklist property. So I need to look into the code to add the defaults + my custom classes. Maybe adding the configured blacklist is better? But then the whitelist should overrule the blacklist, so you can override our blacklisted defaults.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`ClassNotFoundException` doesn't seem a good fit here, since the class might be deployed, but still unwanted to be deserialized. Maybe `HazelcastSerializationException`?

Hi guys, original reporter here! If a whitelist is present, only classes on the union of all whitelists should be allowed. If no whitelist is present, classes not present on the union of all blacklists should be allowed. In both cases, any defaults should be merged with any additions by user configuration. The user should be required to explicitly remove items on the default blacklist.

For example, Weblogic allows a `-class` syntax in user filters which removes any matching classes or packages from the list.

I also agree that `ClassNotFoundException` isn't the right exception to throw here, because it doesn't communicate the correct information. The exception message back to the client should include something indicating that deserialization failed due to filtering, but not give too much information. If local logging is configured, the local log should include more information.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Or more accurately:

If (a class matches a pattern in the whitelist or the whitelist is empty), and it does not also match a pattern in the blacklist, then it is allowed.

If a class matches a pattern in the blacklist, and it does not also match a pattern in the whitelist, then it is not allowed.

Else, it is allowed.

This allows whitelisting `com.package.*`, then disallowing specific classes in the package.

Current plan is to have following configuration:  ``` <hazelcast>     <serialization>         <java-serialization-filter>             <whitelist>                 <class>java.lang.String</class>                 <class>example.Foo</class>                 <package>com.acme.app</package>                 <package>com.acme.app.subpkg</package>             </whitelist>             <blacklist>                 <class>com.acme.app.BeanComparator</class>             </blacklist>         </java-serialization-filter>     </serialization> </hazelcast> ```  The exception, which will be thrown by look-ahead ObjectInputStream is `java.lang.SecurityException`. The deserializer will wrap it into `HazelcastSerializationException`.  **Filtering rules**   * When whitelist is not provided:   1. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is blacklisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is blacklisted, then deserialization fails;   2. deserialization is allowed otherwise. * When whitelist is provided:   1. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is blacklisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is blacklisted, then deserialization fails;   2. if the deserialized object's getClass().getName() is whitelisted or getClass().getPackage().getName() is whitelisted, then deserialization is allowed;   3. deserialization fails otherwise. |

Litter is created on the fast path for package checks. This is not acceptable from a performance point of view. So I'm blocking this PR from merging.

Can you add documentation to this interface? I guess an exception is thrown when the class isn't allowed, but that isn't clear from the end user.

Also the com.hazelcast.nio package is a mixed bag of public and private code. If the end user shouldn't see this code, this logic should be placed to com.hazelcast.internal.serialization.

AFAIK it can't happen that for a regular created serializationservice, the classFilter can be null since if the config is null, a default config is created and used. So afaik this branch normally can't be null.. also there is no proper way to get rid of the check completely (the end user can't trigger the filter to become null).

Litter (the substring) is being created on the fast path. This isn't acceptable.

A potential solution:

1: determine if the class with this package is allowed; so you create your substring. This will only be done once per class.

2: once you have determined the class with this package is valid, replace the classes set by current set with the new class added. So there will be some litter while the system is learning about the classes which are valid, but after that there is no litter.

The only form of synchronization that is needed is to make the classes field volatile and make sure you update the classes field with a cas. the HashSet of classes can remain immutable. Another similar approach would be to use a mutable threadsafe (based on ConcurrentHashMap) set.

| I've updated the PR. The comments were mostly addressed.  The feature is not enabled by default now. The default blacklist is used after adding the `<java-serialization-filter/>` element.  I don't think the package name extraction from a class name is a litter, I like it more than adding classnames without limit to the classname `Set`, or using an overkill like a cache with a proper eviction mechanism. As the feature is not enabled by default, I think we are safe here now from the performance PoV. Do you agree [@pveentjer](https://github.com/pveentjer)? |

This will lead to litter. You can optimize it by storing the clasname in the 'classes'. So this substring check will be done one per class and then it will be stored in 'classes'. Then you need to make classes modifiable by using either a CHM or replace the whole collection and consider it immutable.

This is the second time I placed this comment.

This is the second time I object the suggestion for adding classes to a Set if their packages are listed. It would create another unsafe piece in the code - possible DOS by causing OOM.

Hmm, can't we settle this issue with a JFR test? The current implementation vs. a cached one. And a normal usage scenario vs. a DOS based one (so a handful of classes vs. an attack based with thousands of generated classes). Would be four scenarios in total to compare.

EDIT: Sorry, six scenarios, we should include the current master of course, to see the impact of the feature.

## Description

[![@drosenbauer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3833208?u=c1cf892b642320c2099a9c1a9b404e19cf8f7dcb&v=4&size=48)](/drosenbauer)[drosenbauer](https://github.com/drosenbauer)opened [on Apr 26, 2016](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8024#issue-151231465)

I emailed the support address on April 17 and received a response indicating that I should report my findings here. So here we are.

The Hazelcast cluster join procedure is vulnerable to remote code execution due to Java deserialization. If an attacker can reach a listening Hazelcast instance with a crafted `JoinRequest`, and vulnerable classes are also on the classpath, the attacker can run arbitrary shell commands (among other nefarious things). Hazelcast will blindly deserialize any object it receives in that request stream. Since the `JoinRequest` is what implements authentication, this is necessarily pre-authentication.

This was verified against the latest code from the Git repository, as well as releases 3.7 and 3.2.1.

I have a small whitelist/blacklist filter patch that I can submit a PR for, once I'm cleared to do so. I've already emailed the signed form. Or if you have another solution, feel free!

If you choose to go the filtering route, the Hazelcast team should probably create a default whitelist for serialization, because blacklists are almost always out of date as soon as they are created.
