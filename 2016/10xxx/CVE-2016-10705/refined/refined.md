    *   **Attack vector:** Unspecified, but likely involves exploiting a vulnerability in the mechanism used to change settings.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Would likely require some knowledge of how the post by email feature works or the ability to manipulate requests to the WordPress server

*   **Likes:** An XSS vulnerability was fixed in the Likes module.
    *   **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data in the "Likes" module
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially allowing injection of malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious scripts could be injected into the pages viewed by other users, which could lead to various attacks including session hijacking, redirects and defacement.
