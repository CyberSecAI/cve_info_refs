- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Scoreme theme's `index.php` file does not properly sanitize the `s` parameter in GET requests, allowing for the injection of malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects, malware loads, and manipulation of the affected module context.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a GET request to the `index.php` file, by injecting malicious script code into the `s` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers do not need a privileged user account. Exploitation requires low user interaction.
