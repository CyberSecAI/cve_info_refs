Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `Security::strip_image_tags` function within the Kohana PHP framework. The regular expression used to remove `<img>` tags was not comprehensive enough, specifically expecting a space after `<img`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `strip_image_tags` function failed to properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML tags.
- **Regex Bypass:**  The regular expression used for stripping `<img>` tags had a vulnerability where it could be bypassed by not including a space after the `<img` tag (e.g., `<img/src...`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into web pages. This could lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Stealing user session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or installing malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or functionality of a website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** Attackers could provide crafted input containing the exploitable `<img>` tag bypass through any input field that is processed by `Security::strip_image_tags`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject content:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into an application that uses the vulnerable `Security::strip_image_tags` function. This often involves exploiting a vulnerability in input handling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerable function `strip_image_tags` was removed in a later version and users are advised to use external libraries to sanitize user input.
- The vulnerability was found by David Sopas from Checkmarx.
- Debian LTS issued a security update (DLA 1241-1) to address this vulnerability in libkohana2-php.

In summary, the vulnerability allowed for XSS attacks by bypassing the regex in the function `Security::strip_image_tags` within the Kohana framework due to insufficient sanitization.
