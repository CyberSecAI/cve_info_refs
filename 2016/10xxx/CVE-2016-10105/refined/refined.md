Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2016-10105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `$_GET['section']` parameter in the `admin/plugin.php` file of the Piwigo application. This parameter, which is controlled by the user, is directly used to construct a file path within the plugins directory. Subsequently, the constructed file path is used in an `include_once()` function, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unsanitized User Input:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `$_GET['section']` parameter before using it in a file path construction. While there is a check to remove empty sections and `..` path traversal attempts, it does not fully prevent malicious file inclusion.
-   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The direct use of the user-controlled file path in the `include_once()` function allows an attacker to include any accessible file on the server, potentially leading to code execution if the included file contains PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a file containing malicious PHP code (e.g., disguised as an image or other file type) and then using the vulnerability to include this file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
-   **Server Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete server compromise, allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive data, install backdoors, or further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `section` parameter in the HTTP GET request to point to the malicious file's location within the plugins directory.
-   **File Upload:** The attacker needs to upload a malicious file (e.g. disguised as .jpg with PHP payload inside) to the server, typically within the plugins directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the plugins directory or a location accessible through the application. This could potentially be achieved through a separate vulnerability or an existing feature.
-   **Knowledge of Server File Structure:** The attacker needs some understanding of the server file structure to construct the correct file path via the `section` parameter to include the malicious file.
-   **Access to Admin Interface:**  While the exact access requirements aren't explicitly stated, the vulnerable `admin/plugin.php` file suggests that the attacker may need some form of access to the administrative part of the application to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided commit diffs show the fix for this issue: the code is modified to also validate each section of the path with a regular expression: `!preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z\_\.-]+$/', $sections[$i])`, preventing path traversal and similar tricks.
-   The linked issue #574, clearly describes the vulnerability and its potential for RCE.
-   The fix was included in version 2.8.5 of Piwigo.
