{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The PySAML2 library was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to its use of a weakly configured XML parser when processing SAML XML requests or responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server-side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted SAML XML request or response containing references to external entities.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted SAML XML message to a vulnerable application."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fix_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by integrating the `defusedxml` library which disables external entity loading by default. The fix was included in commit 6e09a25d9b4b7aa7a506853210a9a14100b8bc9b and addressed in pull request #379.",
    "cve_scope": "The CVE scope is limited to XXE vulnerabilities directly within the pysaml2 code itself and does not include vulnerabilities in underlying libraries like libxml2 or xmlsec.",
    "reassignment_note": "Initially, the fix for XXE was associated with CVE-2016-10127, however, it was later clarified that this CVE was specifically for the vulnerability in pysaml2 code, with a separate CVE, CVE-2016-10149, being assigned to an Entity Expansion issue also found in pysaml2."
