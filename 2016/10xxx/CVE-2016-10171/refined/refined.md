Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10171:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read in the `unreorder_channels` function within the `wvunpack.c` file of the WavPack library.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The `unreorder_channels` function attempts to read data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerable code is located in `wvunpack.c:2142:27`.

**Impact:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to read sensitive information from the heap memory.
- While the vendor expressed confidence that these issues were not exploitable, there's still a risk of unexpected program behavior or crashes.
- The full impact is not completely known and might be system-dependent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted WavPack file. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during the decoding process performed by `wvunpack.c`.
- The attacker would need to provide a malicious file to an application or system that uses the vulnerable WavPack library to perform decoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted WavPack file to a system running an application using the vulnerable `wvunpack` decoder.
- The attacker does not require privileged access to trigger the vulnerability as it is triggered by a malformed file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in the commit `4bc05fc490b66ef2d45b1de26abf1455b486b0dc`.
- The provided text also references a mailing list thread which shows that the vendor considers the issues "not exploitable", however, CVE assignment was still deemed necessary.
- The commit fixes multiple issues, identified by CVE-2016-10169, CVE-2016-10170, CVE-2016-10171, and CVE-2016-10172.
