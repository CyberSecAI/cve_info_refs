Abstract

   This document discusses the security implications of the generation
   of IPv6 atomic fragments and a number of interoperability issues
   associated with IPv6 atomic fragments, and concludes that the

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   [RFC2460] specifies the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism, which allows
   IPv6 packets to be fragmented into smaller pieces such that they can
   fit in the Path-MTU to the intended destination(s).

   A legacy IPv4/IPv6 translator implementing the Stateless IP/ICMP
   Translation algorithm [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")] may legitimately generate ICMPv6
   "Packet Too Big" messages [[RFC4443](/doc/html/rfc4443 "\"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")] advertising a "Next-Hop MTU"
   smaller than 1280 (the minimum IPv6 MTU).  [SectionÂ 5 of [RFC2460]](/doc/html/rfc2460#section-5)
   states that, upon receiving such an ICMPv6 error message, hosts are
   not required to reduce the assumed Path-MTU, but must simply include
   a Fragment Header in all subsequent packets sent to that destination.
   The resulting packets will thus *not* be actually fragmented into
   several pieces, but rather be "atomic fragments" [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] (i.e.,
   just include a Fragment Header with both the "Fragment Offset" and
   the "M" flag set to 0).  [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] requires that these atomic
   fragments be essentially processed by the destination host as non-
   fragmented traffic (since there are not really any fragments to be
   reassembled).  The goal of these atomic fragments is simply to convey
   an appropriate Identification value to be employed by IPv6/IPv4
   translators for the resulting IPv4 fragments.

   While atomic fragments might seem rather benign, there are scenarios
   in which the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments can be leveraged for
   performing a number of attacks against the corresponding IPv6 flows.

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful  September 2016

   Since there are concrete security implications arising from the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, and there is no real gain in
   generating IPv6 atomic fragments (as opposed to e.g. having IPv6/IPv4
   translators generate a Fragment Identification value themselves), we
   conclude that this functionality is undesirable.

   [Section 2](#section-2) briefly discusses the security implications of the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, and describes a specific Denial
   of Service (DoS) attack vector that leverages the widespread
   filtering of IPv6 fragments in the public Internet.  [Section 3](#section-3)
   provides additional considerations regarding the usefulness of
   generating IPv6 atomic fragments.

[2](#section-2).  Security Implications of the Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments

   The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at
   length in [[RFC6274](/doc/html/rfc6274 "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol Version 4\"")] and [[RFC7739](/doc/html/rfc7739 "\"Security Implications of Predictable Fragment Identification Values\"")].  An attacker can leverage the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of
   fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual
   fragmentation of packets is not needed), and subsequently perform any
   fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not
   implement [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")].  That is, employing fragmentation where not
   actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be
   employed, unnecessarily.

   We note that, Unfortunately, even nodes that already implement
   [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation
   of IPv6 atomic fragments.  Let us assume that Host A is communicating
   with Server B, and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of
   IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation)
   [[RFC7872](/doc/html/rfc7872 "\"Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in the Real World\"")], some intermediate node filters fragments between Server B
   and Host A.  If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
   (PTB) error message to server B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280,
   this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that
   moment on (as required by [[RFC2460](/doc/html/rfc2460 "\"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")]).  When server B starts sending
   IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB), these
   packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets
   with extension headers were being dropped between Server B and Host
   A.  Thus, this situation will result in a Denial of Service (DoS)
   scenario.

   Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are
   employing IPv6 transport, and they implement Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks).  If
   the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor
   received ICMPv6 Packet Too Big error messages, an attacker could
   easily attack the peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB
   message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.  Once the attack

   packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be
   the ones dropping their own traffic.

   The aforementioned attack vector is exacerbated by the following
   factors:

   o  The attacker does not need to forge the IPv6 Source Address of his
      attack packets.  Hence, deployment of simple [BCP38](/doc/html/bcp38) filters will
      not help as a counter-measure.

   o  Only the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 packet embedded in the ICMPv6
      payload needs to be forged.  While one could envision filtering
      devices enforcing [BCP38](/doc/html/bcp38)-style filters on the ICMPv6 payload, the
      use of extension headers (by the attacker) could make this
      difficult, if at all possible.

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages, as recommended in [SectionÂ 5.2 of
      [RFC4443]](/doc/html/rfc4443#section-5.2) and documented in [[RFC5927](/doc/html/rfc5927 "\"ICMP Attacks against TCP\"")].  It should be noted that in
      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)
      been elicited by a connection-less transport protocol (or some
      other connection-less protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may
      be virtually impossible to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error message.  And, because of IPv6 extension
      headers, the ICMPv6 payload might not even contain any useful
      information on which to perform validation checks.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big"
      error messages, the Destination Cache [[RFC4861](/doc/html/rfc4861 "\"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)\"")] is usually updated
      to reflect that any subsequent packets to such destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6
      "Packet Too Big" error message might affect multiple communication
      instances (e.g., TCP connections) with such destination.

   o  As noted in [Section 3](#section-3), SIIT (Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
      Algorithm) [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")], including derivative protocols such as
      Stateful NAT64 [[RFC6146](/doc/html/rfc6146 "\"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers\"")], was the only technology making use of
      atomic fragments.  Unfortunately, an IPv6 node cannot easily limit
      its exposure to the aforementioned attack vector by only
      generating IPv6 atomic fragments towards IPv4 destinations behind
      a stateless translator.  This is due to the fact that [SectionÂ 3.3
      of [RFC6052]](/doc/html/rfc6052#section-3.3) encourages operators to use a Network-Specific Prefix
      (NSP) that maps the IPv4 address space into IPv6.  When an NSP is
      being used, IPv6 addresses representing IPv4 nodes (reached
      through a stateless translator) are indistinguishable from native
      IPv6 addresses.

[3](#section-3).  Additional Considerations

   Besides the security assessment provided in [Section 2](#section-2), it is
   interesting to evaluate the pros and cons of having an IPv6-to-IPv4
   translating router rely on the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments.

   Relying on the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments implies a reliance
   on:

   1.  ICMPv6 packets arriving from the translator to the IPv6 node

   2.  The ability of the nodes receiving ICMPv6 PTB messages reporting
       an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes to actually produce atomic
       fragments

   3.  Support for IPv6 fragmentation on the IPv6 side of the translator

   4.  The ability of the translator implementation to access the
       information conveyed by the IPv6 Fragment Header

   5.  The value extracted from the low-order 16-bits of the IPv6
       fragment Identification resulting in an appropriate IPv4
       Identification value

   Unfortunately,

   1.  There exists a fair share of evidence of ICMPv6 Packet Too Big
       messages being dropped on the public Internet (for instance, that
       is one of the reasons for which PLPMTUD [[RFC4821](/doc/html/rfc4821 "\"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery\"")] was produced).
       Therefore, relying on such messages being successfully delivered
       will affect the robustness of the protocol that relies on them.

   2.  A number of IPv6 implementations have been known to fail to
       generate IPv6 atomic fragments in response to ICMPv6 PTB messages
       reporting an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes (see [Appendix A](#appendix-A) for a
       small survey).  Additionally, the results included in [SectionÂ 6
       of [RFC6145]](/doc/html/rfc6145#section-6) note that 57% of the tested web servers failed to
       produce IPv6 atomic fragments in response to ICMPv6 PTB messages
       reporting an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.  Thus, any protocol
       relying on IPv6 atomic fragment generation for proper functioning
       will have interoperability problems with the aforementioned IPv6
       stacks.

   3.  IPv6 atomic fragment generation represents a case in which
       fragmented traffic is produced where otherwise it would not be
       needed.  Since there is widespread filtering of IPv6 fragments in
       the public Internet [[RFC7872](/doc/html/rfc7872 "\"Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in the Real World\"")], this would mean that the
       (unnecessary) use of IPv6 fragmentation might result,

       unnecessarily, in a Denial of Service situation even in
       legitimate cases.

   4.  The packet-handling API at the node where the translator is
       running may obscure fragmentation-related information.  In such
       scenarios, the information conveyed by the Fragment Header may be
       unavailable to the translator.  [[JOOL](#ref-JOOL "\"nf_defrag_ipv4 and nf_defrag_ipv6\"")] discusses a sample
       framework (Linux Netfilter) that hinders access to the
       information conveyed in IPv6 atomic fragments.

   5.  While [[RFC2460](/doc/html/rfc2460 "\"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")] requires that the IPv6 fragment Identification of
       a fragmented packet be different that of any other fragmented
       packet sent recently with the same Source Address and Destination
       Address, there is no requirement on the low-order 16-bits of such
       value.  Thus, there is no guarantee that, by employing the low-
       order 16-bits of the IPv6 fragment Identification of a packet
       sent by a source host, IPv4 fragment identification collisions
       will be avoided or reduced.  Besides, collisions might occur
       where two distinct IPv6 Destination Addresses are translated into
       the same IPv4 address, such that Identification values that might
       have been generated to be unique in the IPv6 context end up
       colliding when used in the translated IPv4 context.

   We note that SIIT essentially employs the Fragment Header of IPv6
   atomic fragments to signal the translator how to set the DF bit of
   IPv4 datagrams (the DF bit is cleared when the IPv6 packet contains a
   Fragment Header, and is otherwise set to 1 when the IPv6 packet does
   not contain an IPv6 Fragment Header).  Additionally, the translator
   will employ the low-order 16-bits of the IPv6 Fragment Identification
   for setting the IPv4 Fragment Identification.  At least in theory,
   this is expected to reduce the IPv4 Identification collision rate in
   the following specific scenario:

   1.  An IPv6 node communicates with an IPv4 node (through SIIT).

   2.  The IPv4 node is located behind an IPv4 link with an MTU smaller
       than 1260 bytes.  An IPv4 Path MTU of 1260 corresponds to an IPv6
       Path MTU of 1280, due to an option-less IPv4 header being 20
       bytes shorter than the IPv6 header.

   3.  ECMP routing [[RFC2992](/doc/html/rfc2992 "\"Analysis of an Equal-Cost Multi-Path Algorithm\"")] with more than one translator is employed
       for e.g., redundancy purposes.

   In such a scenario, if each translator were to select the IPv4
   Identification on its own (rather than selecting the IPv4
   Identification from the low-order 16-bits of the Fragment
   Identification of IPv6 atomic fragments), this could possibly lead to
   IPv4 Identification collisions.  However, as noted above, the value

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful  September 2016

   extracted from the low-order 16-bits of the IPv6 fragment
   Identification might not result in an appropriate IPv4
   identification: for example, a number of implementations set the IPv6
   Fragment Identification according to the output of a Pseudo-Random
   Number Generator (PRNG) (see [AppendixÂ B of [RFC7739]](/doc/html/rfc7739#appendix-B)); hence,if the
   translator only employs the low-order 16-bits of such value, it is
   very unlikely that relying on the Fragment Identification of the IPv6
   atomic fragment will result in a reduced IPv4 Identification
   collision rate (when compared to the case where the translator
   selects each IPv4 Identification on its own).  Besides, because of
   the limited sized of the IPv4 identification field, it is
   nevertheless virtually impossible to guarantee uniqueness of the IPv4
   identification values without artificially limiting the data rate of
   fragmented traffic [[RFC6864](/doc/html/rfc6864 "\"Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID Field\"")] [[RFC4963](/doc/html/rfc4963 "\"IPv4 Reassembly Errors at High Data Rates\"")].

   [RFC6145] was the only "consumer" of IPv6 atomic fragments, and it
   correctly and diligently noted (in [Section 6](#section-6)) the possible
   interoperability problems of relying on IPv6 atomic fragments,
   proposing a workaround that led to more robust behavior and
   simplified code.  [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")] has been obsoleted by [[RFC7915](/doc/html/rfc7915 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")], such
   that SIIT does not rely on IPv6 atomic fragments.

[4](#section-4).  Conclusions

   Taking all of the above considerations into account, we recommend
   that IPv6 atomic fragments be deprecated.

   In particular:

   o  IPv4/IPv6 translators should be updated to not generate ICMPv6
      Packet Too Big errors containing a Path MTU value smaller than the
      minimum IPv6 MTU of 1280 bytes.  This will ensure that current
      IPv6 nodes will never have a legitimate need to start generating
      IPv6 atomic fragments.

   o  The recommendation in the previous bullet ensures there no longer
      are any valid reasons for ICMPv6 Packet Too Big errors containing
      a Path MTU value smaller than the minimum IPv6 MTU to exist.  IPv6
      nodes should therefore be updated to ignore them as invalid.

   We note that these recommendations have been incorporated in
   [[I-D.ietf-6man-rfc1981bis](#ref-I-D.ietf-6man-rfc1981bis)], [[I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis](#ref-I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis)] and [[RFC7915](/doc/html/rfc7915 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")].

Internet-Draft  IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful  September 2016

[6](#section-6).  Security Considerations

   This document briefly discusses the security implications of the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, and describes one specific
   Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector that leverages the widespread
   filtering of IPv6 fragments in the public Internet.  It concludes
   that the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments is an undesirable
   feature, and documents the motivation for removing this functionality
   from [[I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis](#ref-I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis)].

[Appendix A](#appendix-A).  Small Survey of OSes that Fail to Produce IPv6 Atomic
             Fragments

   [This section will probably be removed from this document before it
   is published as an RFC].

   This section includes a non-exhaustive list of operating systems that
   *fail* to produce IPv6 atomic fragments.  It is based on the results
   published in [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] and [[Morbitzer](#ref-Morbitzer)].  It is simply meant as a
   datapoint regarding the extent to which IPv6 implementations can be
   relied upon to generate IPv6 atomic fragments.

   The following Operating Systems fail to generate IPv6 atomic
   fragments in response to ICMPv6 PTB messages that report an MTU
   smaller than 1280 bytes:

   o  FreeBSD 8.0

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* It was discovered that a remote attacker could leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and could subsequently perform any type of a fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement RFC6946. (CVE-2016-10142, Moderate)
* A flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual->physical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table). (CVE-2016-2069, Moderate)
* A race condition flaw was found in the ioctl\_send\_fib() function in the Linux kernel's aacraid implementation. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access or system crash) by changing a certain size value. (CVE-2016-6480, Moderate)
* It was found that when the gcc stack protector was enabled, reading the /proc/keys file could cause a panic in the Linux kernel due to stack corruption. This happened because an incorrect buffer size was used to hold a 64-bit timeout value rendered as weeks. (CVE-2016-7042, Moderate)
* It was found that when file permissions were modified via chmod and the user modifying them was not in the owning group or capable of CAP\_FSETID, the setgid bit would be cleared. Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr sets the file permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in a similar way. This could allow a local user to gain group privileges via certain setgid applications. (CVE-2016-7097, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the Linux networking subsystem where a local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capabilities could cause an out-of-bounds memory access by creating a smaller-than-expected ICMP header and sending to its destination via sendto(). (CVE-2016-8399, Moderate)
* It was found that the blk\_rq\_map\_user\_iov() function in the Linux kernel's block device implementation did not properly restrict the type of iterator, which could allow a local attacker to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging write access to a /dev/sg device. (CVE-2016-9576, CVE-2016-10088, Moderate)
* A flaw was found in the USB-MIDI Linux kernel driver: a double-free error could be triggered for the 'umidi' object. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2016-2384, Low)

The CVE-2016-7042 issue was discovered by Ondrej Kozina (Red Hat) and the CVE-2016-7097 issue was discovered by Andreas Gruenbacher (Red Hat) and Jan Kara (SUSE).

         Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful

Abstract

   This document discusses the security implications of the generation
   of IPv6 atomic fragments and a number of interoperability issues

   aforementioned functionality is undesirable and thus documents the
   motivation for removing this functionality from an upcoming revision
   of the core IPv6 protocol specification ([RFC 2460](/doc/html/rfc2460)).

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   [RFC2460] specifies the IPv6 fragmentation mechanism, which allows
   IPv6 packets to be fragmented into smaller pieces such that they can
   fit in the Path MTU to the intended destination(s).

   A legacy IPv4/IPv6 translator implementing the Stateless IP/ICMP
   Translation Algorithm [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")] may legitimately generate ICMPv6
   "Packet Too Big" (PTB) error messages [[RFC4443](/doc/html/rfc4443 "\"Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")] advertising an MTU
   smaller than 1280 (the minimum IPv6 MTU).  [SectionÂ 5 of [RFC2460]](/doc/html/rfc2460#section-5)
   states that, upon receiving such an ICMPv6 error message, hosts are
   not required to reduce the assumed Path MTU but must simply include a
   Fragment Header in all subsequent packets sent to that destination.
   The resulting packets will thus *not* be actually fragmented into
   several pieces; rather, they will be "atomic" fragments [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")]
   (i.e., they will just include a Fragment Header with both the
   "Fragment Offset" and the "M" flag set to 0).  [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] requires
   that these atomic fragments be essentially processed by the
   destination host(s) as non-fragmented traffic (since there are not

   really any fragments to be reassembled).  The goal of these atomic
   fragments is simply to convey an appropriate Identification value to
   be employed by IPv6/IPv4 translators for the resulting IPv4
   fragments.

   While atomic fragments might seem rather benign, there are scenarios
   in which the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments can be leveraged for
   performing a number of attacks against the corresponding IPv6 flows.
   Since there are concrete security implications arising from the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments and there is no real gain in
   generating IPv6 atomic fragments (as opposed to, for example, having
   IPv6/IPv4 translators generate an IPv4 Identification value
   themselves), we conclude that this functionality is undesirable.

   [Section 2](#section-2) briefly discusses the security implications of the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments and describes a specific
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack vector that leverages the widespread
   dropping of IPv6 fragments in the public Internet.  [Section 3](#section-3)
   provides additional considerations regarding the usefulness of
   generating IPv6 atomic fragments.

[2](#section-2).  Security Implications of the Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments

   The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at
   length in [[RFC6274](/doc/html/rfc6274 "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol Version 4\"")] and [[RFC7739](/doc/html/rfc7739 "\"Security Implications of Predictable Fragment Identification Values\"")].  An attacker can leverage the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of
   fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual
   fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform
   any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that
   do not implement [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")].  That is, employing fragmentation where
   not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to
   be employed, unnecessarily.

   We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement
   [[RFC6946](/doc/html/rfc6946 "\"Processing of IPv6 \"")] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation
   of IPv6 atomic fragments.  Let us assume that Host A is communicating
   with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6
   packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation)
   [[RFC7872](/doc/html/rfc7872 "\"Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in the Real World\"")], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B
   and Host A.  If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message
   to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required
   by [[RFC2460](/doc/html/rfc2460 "\"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")]).  When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in
   response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets
   will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with
   extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A.
   Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario.

[RFC 8021](/doc/html/rfc8021)        IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful    January 2017

   Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are
   employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks).  If
   the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor
   received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack
   the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB
   message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.  Once the attack
   packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be
   the ones dropping their own traffic.

   The aforementioned attack vector is exacerbated by the following
   factors:

   o  The attacker does not need to forge the IPv6 Source Address of his
      attack packets.  Hence, deployment of simple filters as per [BCP 38](/doc/html/bcp38)
      [[BCP38](#ref-BCP38 "\"Network Ingress Filtering: Defeating Denial of Service Attacks which employ IP Source Address Spoofing\"")] does not help as a countermeasure.

   o  Only the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 packet embedded in the ICMPv6
      payload need to be forged.  While one could envision filtering
      devices enforcing filters in the style of [BCP 38](/doc/html/bcp38) on the ICMPv6
      payload, the use of extension headers (by the attacker) could make
      this difficult, if not impossible.

   o  Many implementations fail to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error messages as recommended in [SectionÂ 5.2 of
      [RFC4443]](/doc/html/rfc4443#section-5.2) and documented in [[RFC5927](/doc/html/rfc5927 "\"ICMP Attacks against TCP\"")].  It should be noted that in
      some cases, such as when an ICMPv6 error message has (supposedly)
      been elicited by a connectionless transport protocol (or some
      other connectionless protocol being encapsulated in IPv6), it may
      be virtually impossible to perform validation checks on the
      received ICMPv6 error message.  And, because of IPv6 extension
      headers, the ICMPv6 payload might not even contain any useful
      information on which to perform validation checks.

   o  Upon receipt of one of the aforementioned ICMPv6 PTB error
      messages, the Destination Cache [[RFC4861](/doc/html/rfc4861 "\"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)\"")] is usually updated to
      reflect that any subsequent packets to such a destination should
      include a Fragment Header.  This means that a single ICMPv6 PTB
      error message might affect multiple communication instances (e.g.,
      TCP connections) with such a destination.

   o  As noted in [Section 3](#section-3), SIIT (the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
      Algorithm) [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")], including derivative protocols such as
      Stateful NAT64 (Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6
      Clients to IPv4 Servers) [[RFC6146](/doc/html/rfc6146 "\"Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers\"")], was the only technology making
      use of atomic fragments.  Unfortunately, an IPv6 node cannot
      easily limit its exposure to the aforementioned attack vector by
      only generating IPv6 atomic fragments towards IPv4 destinations

[RFC 8021](/doc/html/rfc8021)        IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful    January 2017

      behind a stateless translator.  This is due to the fact that
      [SectionÂ 3.3 of [RFC6052]](/doc/html/rfc6052#section-3.3) encourages operators to use a
      Network-Specific Prefix (NSP) that maps the IPv4 address space
      into IPv6.  When an NSP is being used, IPv6 addresses representing
      IPv4 nodes (reached through a stateless translator) are
      indistinguishable from native IPv6 addresses.

[3](#section-3).  Additional Considerations

   Besides the security assessment provided in [Section 2](#section-2), it is
   interesting to evaluate the pros and cons of having an IPv6-to-IPv4
   translating router rely on the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments.

   Relying on the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments implies a
   reliance on:

   1.  ICMPv6 packets arriving from the translator to the destination
       IPv6 node

   2.  The ability of the nodes receiving ICMPv6 PTB messages reporting
       an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes to actually produce atomic
       fragments

   3.  Support for IPv6 fragmentation on the IPv6 side of the translator

   4.  The ability of the translator implementation to access the
       information conveyed by the Fragment Header

   5.  The value extracted from the low-order 16 bits of the IPv6
       fragment header Identification field resulting in an appropriate
       IPv4 Identification value

   Unfortunately,

   1.  There exists a fair share of evidence of ICMPv6 PTB error
       messages being dropped on the public Internet (for instance, that
       is one of the reasons for which Packetization Layer Path MTU
       Discovery (PLPMTUD) [[RFC4821](/doc/html/rfc4821 "\"Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery\"")] was produced).  Therefore, relying
       on such messages being successfully delivered will affect the
       robustness of the protocol that relies on them.

   2.  A number of IPv6 implementations have been known to fail to
       generate IPv6 atomic fragments in response to ICMPv6 PTB messages
       reporting an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes.  Additionally, the
       results included in [SectionÂ 6 of [RFC6145]](/doc/html/rfc6145#section-6) note that 57% of the
       tested web servers failed to produce IPv6 atomic fragments in
       response to ICMPv6 PTB messages reporting an MTU smaller than

```

[RFC 8021](/doc/html/rfc8021)        IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful    January 2017

       1280 bytes.  Thus, any protocol relying on IPv6 atomic fragment
       generation for proper functioning will have interoperability
       problems with the aforementioned IPv6 stacks.

   3.  IPv6 atomic fragment generation represents a case in which
       fragmented traffic is produced where otherwise it would not be
       needed.  Since there is widespread dropping of IPv6 fragments in
       the public Internet [[RFC7872](/doc/html/rfc7872 "\"Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in the Real World\"")], this would mean that the
       (unnecessary) use of IPv6 fragmentation might result,
       unnecessarily, in a DoS situation even in legitimate cases.

   4.  The packet-handling API at the node where the translator is
       running may obscure fragmentation-related information.  In such
       scenarios, the information conveyed by the Fragment Header may be
       unavailable to the translator.  [[JOOL](#ref-JOOL "\"nf_defrag_ipv4 and nf_defrag_ipv6\"")] discusses a sample
       framework (Linux Netfilter) that hinders access to the
       information conveyed in IPv6 fragments.

   5.  While [[RFC2460](/doc/html/rfc2460 "\"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification\"")] requires that the IPv6 fragment header
       Identification field of a fragmented packet be different than
       that of any other fragmented packet sent recently with the same
       Source Address and Destination Address, there is no requirement
       on the low-order 16 bits of such a value.  Thus, there is no
       guarantee that IPv4 fragment Identification collisions will be
       avoided or reduced by employing the low-order 16 bits of the IPv6
       fragment header Identification field of a packet sent by a source
       host.  Besides, collisions might occur where two distinct IPv6
       Destination Addresses are translated into the same IPv4 address,
       such that Identification values that might have been generated to
       be unique in the context of IPv6 end up colliding when used in
       the context of translated IPv4.

   We note that SIIT essentially employs the Fragment Header of IPv6
   atomic fragments to signal the translator how to set the Don't
   Fragment (DF) bit of IPv4 datagrams (the DF bit is cleared when the
   IPv6 packet contains a Fragment Header and is otherwise set to 1 when
   the IPv6 packet does not contain a Fragment Header).  Additionally,
   the translator will employ the low-order 16 bits of the IPv6 fragment
   header Identification field for setting the IPv4 Identification.  At
   least in theory, this is expected to reduce the IPv4 Identification
   collision rate in the following specific scenario:

   1.  An IPv6 node communicates with an IPv4 node (through SIIT).

   2.  The IPv4 node is located behind an IPv4 link with an MTU smaller
       than 1260 bytes.  An IPv4 Path MTU of 1260 corresponds to an IPv6
       Path MTU of 1280, due to an optionless IPv4 header being 20 bytes
       shorter than the IPv6 header.

   3.  ECMP routing [[RFC2992](/doc/html/rfc2992 "\"Analysis of an Equal-Cost Multi-Path Algorithm\"")] with more than one translator is employed,
       for example, for redundancy purposes.

   In such a scenario, if each translator were to select the IPv4
   Identification on its own (rather than selecting the IPv4
   Identification from the low-order 16 bits of the fragment
   Identification of IPv6 atomic fragments), this could possibly lead to
   IPv4 Identification collisions.  However, as noted above, the value
   extracted from the low-order 16 bits of the IPv6 fragment header
   Identification field might not result in an appropriate IPv4
   Identification: for example, a number of implementations set the IPv6
   fragment header Identification field according to the output of a
   Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) (see [AppendixÂ B of [RFC7739]](/doc/html/rfc7739#appendix-B));
   hence, if the translator only employs the low-order 16 bits of such a
   value, it is very unlikely that relying on the fragment
   Identification of the IPv6 atomic fragment will result in a reduced
   IPv4 Identification collision rate (when compared to the case where
   the translator selects each IPv4 Identification on its own).
   Besides, because of the limited size of the IPv4 Identification
   field, it is nevertheless virtually impossible to guarantee
   uniqueness of the IPv4 Identification values without artificially
   limiting the data rate of fragmented traffic [[RFC6864](/doc/html/rfc6864 "\"Updated Specification of the IPv4 ID Field\"")] [[RFC4963](/doc/html/rfc4963 "\"IPv4 Reassembly Errors at High Data Rates\"")].

   [RFC6145] was the only "consumer" of IPv6 atomic fragments, and it
   correctly and diligently noted (in its [Section 6](#section-6)) the possible
   interoperability problems of relying on IPv6 atomic fragments,
   proposing a workaround that led to more robust behavior and
   simplified code.  [[RFC6145](/doc/html/rfc6145 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")] has been obsoleted by [[RFC7915](/doc/html/rfc7915 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")], such
   that SIIT does not rely on IPv6 atomic fragments.

[RFC 8021](/doc/html/rfc8021)        IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered Harmful    January 2017

[4](#section-4).  Conclusions

   Taking all of the above considerations into account, we recommend
   that IPv6 atomic fragments be deprecated.

   In particular:

   o  IPv4/IPv6 translators should be updated to not generate ICMPv6 PTB
      error messages containing an MTU value smaller than the minimum
      IPv6 MTU of 1280 bytes.  This will ensure that current IPv6 nodes
      will never have a legitimate need to start generating IPv6 atomic
      fragments.

   o  The recommendation in the previous bullet ensures that there are
      no longer any valid reasons for ICMPv6 PTB error messages
      reporting an MTU value smaller than the minimum IPv6 MTU
      (1280 bytes).  IPv6 nodes should therefore be updated to ignore
      ICMPv6 PTB error messages reporting an MTU smaller than 1280 bytes
      as invalid.

   We note that these recommendations have been incorporated in
   [[IPv6-PMTUD](#ref-IPv6-PMTUD)], [[IPv6-Spec](#ref-IPv6-Spec)], and [[RFC7915](/doc/html/rfc7915 "\"IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm\"")].

[5](#section-5).  Security Considerations

   This document briefly discusses the security implications of the
   generation of IPv6 atomic fragments and describes one specific DoS
   attack vector that leverages the widespread dropping of IPv6
   fragments in the public Internet.  It concludes that the generation
   of IPv6 atomic fragments is an undesirable feature and documents the

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1415908#c0)  Wade Mealing    2017-01-24 03:57:01 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily.   We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario.  Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
