# RHSA-2020:0133 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Decision Manager 7.6.0 Security Update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Decision Manager.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Decision Manager is an open source decision management platform that combines business rules management, complex event processing, Decision Model & Notation (DMN) execution, and Business Optimizer for solving planning problems. It automates business decisions and makes that logic available to the entire business.

This release of Red Hat Decision Manager 7.6.0 serves as an update to Red Hat Decision Manager 7.5.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* bootstrap: XSS in the affix configuration target property (CVE-2018-20677)
* bootstrap: XSS in the data-target attribute (CVE-2016-10735)
* bootstrap: XSS in the tooltip data-viewport attribute (CVE-2018-20676)
* Business-central: Encrypted password shown under Object id 7 of errai\_security\_context (CVE-2019-14886)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For on-premise installations, before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

# Bootstrap 3.4.0

[![](https://github.com/mdo.png?size=32)
@mdo](https://github.com/mdo)

December 13, 2018

That’s not a typo—today we’re shipping Bootstrap 3.4.0, a long overdue update to address some quality of life issues, XSS fixes, and build tooling updates to make it easier for us, and you, to develop.

While we’d planned for ages to do a fresh v3.x update, we lost steam as energy was focused on all the work in v4. Early this year, [one issue in particular](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25679) gained a ton of momentum from the community and the core team decided to do a huge push to pull together a solid release. I regret the time it took to pull this release together, especially given the security fixes, but with the improvements under the hood, v3 has never been easier to develop and maintain. Thanks for your continued support along the way!

Keep reading for what’s changed and a look ahead at what’s coming in v4.2.0.

## What’s new

While we haven’t publicly worked on v3.x in years, we’ve heard from all of you during that time that we needed to do a new release to address

* **New:** Added a `.row-no-gutters` class.
* **New:** Added docs searching via Algolia.
* **Fixed:** Resolved an XSS issue in Alert, Carousel, Collapse, Dropdown, Modal, and Tab components. See [https://security.snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20160627](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Abootstrap%3A20160627) for details.
* **Fixed:** Added padding to `.navbar-fixed-*` on modal open
* **Fixed:** Removed the double border on `<abbr>` elements.
* Removed Gist creation in web-based Customizer since anonymous gists were disabled long ago by GitHub.
* Removed drag and drop support from Customizer since it didn’t work anymore.

Our documentation and tooling saw massive updates as well to make it easier to work on v3.x, for ourselves and for you.

* Added a dropdown to the docs nav for newer and previous versions.
* Update the docs to use a new `baseurl`, `/docs/3.4/`, to version the v3.x documentation like we do with v4.
* Reorganized the v3 docs CSS to use Less.
* Switched to BrowserStack for tests.
* Updated links to always use https and fix broken URLs.
* Replaced ZeroClipboard with clipboard.js

[Head to the Bootstrap 3.4 docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/) to see the latest in action. [Check out the v3.4.0 pull request](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/27288) for even more context on what’s changed.

## Upgrading

Upgrade your Bootstrap 3 projects to v3.4.0 with `npm i bootstrap@previous` or `npm i bootstrap@3.4.0`. This release won’t be available via Bower to start given the package manager was deprecated and has largely been unused by us in v4 for well over a year. Stay tuned for CDN and Rubygem updates.

## Open Collective

Also new with our v3.4 is the creation of an [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/bootstrap) to help support the maintainers contributing to Bootstrap. The team has been very excited about this as a way to be transparent about maintainer costs (both time and money), as well as recognition of efforts.

## v4.2 and beyond

We’ve been working on a [huge v4.2 update](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/6?fullscreen=true) for several months now. Our attention has largely been on advancing the project and simplifying it’s dependencies, namely by removing our jQuery dependency. That work has sparked a keen interest in a moderately scoped v5 release, so we’ve been taking our sweet time with v4.2 to sneak in as many new features as we can.

After we ship v4.2, we’ll plan for point releases to address any bugs and improvements as y’all start to use the new version. From there, we’ll start to share more plans on v5 to remove jQuery, drop support for older browsers, and clear up some cruft. This won’t be a sweeping rewrite, but rather an iterative improvement on v4. Stay tuned!

[![@lpilorz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20169928?v=4&size=48)](/lpilorz)[lpilorz](https://github.com/lpilorz)opened [on Jun 27, 2016](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20184#issue-162481500)

The data-target attribute is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting attacks:

| What about `js/dist/util.js` will CI generate these?  Asking because I have started from writing failing unit tests, and they still fail unless I also fix it over there.  Fyi, you can find these tests here: <https://github.com/meeque/bootstrap/tree/topic/20184-xss-in-data-target-attribute> I've already merged your fix into that. |

| Yes Travis build our code and in this case update `js/dist/util.js` and only added a Visual test because when we fail to get a target they aren't any error so that's a bit difficult to test that with Travis and we don't have unit tests for `util.js`  Is it a correct fix for you ? |

| Yes, the fix looks fine.  I'll have a look around, and check if other features might be affected similarly. I'd open new issues in that case...  The qunit test that I wrote seem to work rather fine either way. Of course, for the positive case there is not much to check, so they just wait for a (very short) timeout, and assert that nothing has happened. |

| But all I'm saying it's just when Mark is done, he should merge his changes in v3-dev. v3.4.0 seems a lot more specific, more of a WIP branch that will be merged to the base v3-dev one when done. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@GeyseR](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364479?v=4&size=48)](/GeyseR)[GeyseR](https://github.com/GeyseR)opened [on Dec 23, 2018](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27915#issue-393762774)

Github considers Bootstrap 3.4.0 an insecure dependency via its [security vulnerability alerts tool](https://help.github.com/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies). It points to the [NVD CVE-2018-14041](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14041) page, which shows that only >4.1.2 is secure. Is 3.4.0 safe to use as it has a fix for the [npm:bootstrap:20160627](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Abootstrap%3A20160627) vulnerability or it is something different?

#### Description

In PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 in certain configurations of FPM setup it is possible to cause FPM module to write past allocated buffers into the space reserved for FCGI protocol data, thus opening the possibility of remote code execution.

*Published: 2019-10-24*

Web servers using nginx and PHP-FPM are vulnerable to this flaw under certain conditions. Background On October 22, security researcher Omar Ganiev published a tweet regarding a “freshly patched” remote code execution vulnerability in PHP-FPM, the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) for PHP. The tweet includes a link to a GitHub repository containing a proof of concept (PoC) for the vulnerability.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1702953#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-04-25 09:08:49 UTC  ``` The admin backchannel logout route (/k_logout) doesn't verify the signature of the JWT it receives from Keycloak. This causes to the adapter to update the grant manager with a NBF in the future. This effectively logs users out of the app and prevents them from logging in again. Since the tokens received from the code exchange will appear to be in the future, this could be used maliciously against applications using the adapter.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-nodejs-connect/commit/55e54b55d05ba636bc125a8f3d39f0052d13f8f6>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1702953#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-11 15:32:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3.2 zip  Via RHSA-2019:1456 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1456](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1456)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1702953#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:07:06 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-10157>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1702953#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2019-08-08 07:24:22 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following product:   * Red Hat Mobile Application Platform   Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhmap> for more details   ``` |  |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:
