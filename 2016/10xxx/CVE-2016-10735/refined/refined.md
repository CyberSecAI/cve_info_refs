Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Bootstrap framework, specifically in how the `data-target` attribute is handled. This attribute is used by Bootstrap's JavaScript components to identify target elements for interactive features like collapse, tabs, and modals. The vulnerability exists because the value of the `data-target` attribute is not properly sanitized before being used within the Document Object Model (DOM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and/or JavaScript code into a web page through the `data-target` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser session. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing user cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information.
    - **Data Theft:**  Accessing private or confidential data handled by the web application.
    - **Malicious Actions:** Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of a website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Injection:** An attacker could insert a malicious `data-target` attribute when creating a web page or modify an existing page.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker could intercept and alter an HTTP response to inject the malicious attribute.
- **Stored XSS:** If the vulnerable application allows users to save data that includes a crafted `data-target` attribute, this could lead to a stored XSS scenario where all subsequent users of that function will be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject or modify HTML:** An attacker must be able to manipulate the HTML source of a web page to inject the malicious code within the `data-target` attribute. This could be through direct access to the application's source code, a man-in-the-middle attack, or via a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **No special user privileges:**  The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can manipulate the affected attribute, requiring no higher privileged access.
- **User interaction:** In most cases, a user interaction is required. For example, if an attacker changes the data-target to some JavaScript when a button is clicked the JavaScript will be triggered after the user clicks the button.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Affected versions:** Bootstrap versions 2.x, 3.x (before 3.4.0), and 4.x beta (before 4.0.0-beta.2) are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed in Bootstrap 3.4.0 and 4.0.0-beta.2.
- **Different from CVE-2018-14041:** The content clearly specifies that this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-14041, which affects the `scrollspy` component and `data-target` attribute specifically.
- **Patches:** Red Hat also backported fixes for this vulnerability to multiple products.
- **Tenable:** Tenable also has identified this vulnerability within its scanner and tools.
- **Mitigation:** The suggested mitigation is to upgrade to the latest version of bootstrap.
