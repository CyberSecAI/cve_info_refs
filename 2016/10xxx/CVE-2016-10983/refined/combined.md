## Description

### Ghost Migrator: The easy way to migrate data to Ghost

The official Ghost plugin allows you to export your WordPress data in a JSON format that can be imported quickly and easily by the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) publishing platform.

#### Features Overview

The Ghost Migrator plugin will export as much blog and publication data as it can into a clean set of exported files.

* Posts, pages, tags and authors are all automatically exported and recreated for Ghost
* Tags will be migrated, but not categories. If needed you can [convert your categories to tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpcat2tag-importer/) before exporting.
* Ghost does not have built-in comments, but it does integrate with [many comment platforms](https://ghost.org/integrations/?tag=community) if you want to migrate your comments there.
* No custom fields, meta, shortcodes, post types, taxonomies or binary files will be migrated. Just regular **posts**, **pages**, **tags** and **images**
* Passwords are not migrated ‚Äì after importing to Ghost, each user may perform a password reset to gain access to their Ghost account

#### Docs & Support

You can find [docs](https://ghost.org/docs/), [FAQ](https://ghost.org/faq/) and more detailed information about Ghost on [ghost.org](https://ghost.org). If you‚Äôre unable to find the answer to your question in our FAQ or in any of the documentation, try searching the [Ghost support forum](https://forum.ghost.org) ‚Äì if you still don‚Äôt find the answer you need, post a new topic!

#### 0.0.3

* Fixed a typo I left in the previous version causing everything to not work‚Ä¶ Sorry‚Ä¶

#### 0.0.2

* Fixed a path issue that would sometimes result in empty .json files. Hat tip to Ian Wootten for the fix!
