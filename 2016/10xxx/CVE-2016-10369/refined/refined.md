Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10369:

*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure use of `/tmp` for a socket file in lxterminal.
*   **Root Cause:** The `lxterminal` application creates a socket file in the `/tmp` directory with a predictable name.
*   **Weakness:** The `/tmp` directory is world-writable.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local user can pre-create a socket file in `/tmp` with the same name that `lxterminal` uses.
*   **Impact:**

    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If an attacker creates a file or socket in `/tmp/.lxterminal-socket:0-bob`, the user "bob" will be unable to open `lxterminal` or a new `lxterminal` instance.
    *   **Potential for other impact (bypassing terminal access control):** While not explicitly detailed, the vulnerability description suggests the possibility of hijacking the socket to potentially gain unauthorized access or control over the terminal session.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be a local user on the same machine as the victim.
*   **Affected Versions:** lxterminal versions up to 0.3.0.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in lxterminal version 0.3.0-2 and 0.2.0-1+deb8u1 by addressing the improper use of `/tmp` for the socket file.

The stackexchange content provides more context on how lxterminal uses sockets for client/server communication between instances, which exacerbates the security risk. The Debian bug report confirms the vulnerability and its fix.
