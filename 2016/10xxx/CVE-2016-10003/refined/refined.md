Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect comparison of HTTP request headers within the Squid proxy's Collapsed Forwarding feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Squid compares request headers when Collapsed Forwarding is enabled. Due to this incorrect comparison, Squid can deliver cached responses that contain private data to clients that should not have access to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially gain access to private and sensitive information from another client's browsing session.
- **Credential Theft:** The exposed information might include credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access to other sensitive resources.
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  The vulnerability is especially critical for HTTPS reverse-proxy sites using Collapsed Forwarding.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this over a network.
- The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Squid proxy that has Collapsed Forwarding enabled.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the proxy server itself.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability or the ability to probe the cache is required to successfully perform the attack.

**Affected Versions:**
- Squid versions 3.5 up to 3.5.22
- Squid versions 4.0 up to 4.0.16

**Fixed Versions:**
- Squid 3.5.23
- Squid 4.0.17

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered only when the `collapsed_forwarding` option is enabled in the `squid.conf` file.
- A workaround is provided by disabling `collapsed_forwarding`.
- The advisory mentions that there might be another unresolved issue with headers leaks in the fix but it's not deemed as a serious security issue.
- The issue was reported by Felix Hassert from Sevenval Technologies GmbH and fixed by Eduard Bagdasaryan from Measurement Factory.
