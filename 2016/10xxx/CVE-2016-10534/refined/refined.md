The provided content is related to CVE-2016-10534.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `--strict-ssl` command-line option in `electron-packager` defaulted to `false` instead of `true` when not explicitly set in versions 5.2.1 to 6.0.2. This was caused by a commit that changed the default value and was later corrected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is the lack of proper SSL certificate validation when using the electron-packager CLI, due to the incorrect default for `--strict-ssl`. This allows for potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If a MITM attacker is present, they could potentially intercept and modify data being downloaded by electron-packager, such as the Electron binaries. This could lead to a compromise of the application built by electron-packager.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. An attacker would need to intercept the network traffic between the machine running `electron-packager` and the server providing the Electron binaries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as being on the same network as the victim, or by compromising a router or network infrastructure component in between. They do not need any specific credentials for the victim system or software.
