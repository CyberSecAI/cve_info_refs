## Description

[![@feross](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121766?u=c9234b2a786d4d3722ab876563eb63069cd54959&v=4&size=48)](/feross)[feross](https://github.com/feross)opened [on Apr 19, 2016](https://github.com/electron/packager/issues/333#issue-149320674)

There exists a bug in electron-packager from versions 5.2.1 - 6.0.2 where the `--strict-ssl` command line option defaults to `false` when not explicitly set to `true`.

This only affects users using the electron-packager CLI. The `strict-ssl` option defaults to `true` for the node.js API.

The commit that introduced the issue is here: [30bdd0b](https://github.com/electron/packager/commit/30bdd0b187e96bc45ce20d5363104917a48fd93b)

The commit that fixed the issue is here: [ebea1d8](https://github.com/electron/packager/commit/ebea1d8c177f2a2816687c4a445998cc35375a18)

**The issue is fixed in v7.0.0. All users should upgrade immediately.**

It's also recommended to delete the electron-download cache folder, by default named `.electron`, and located in your home folder. For example:

```
rm -rf ~/.electron

```
