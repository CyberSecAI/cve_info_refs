  "CVE-2016-10392": {
    "status": "RELATED",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within a Qualcomm closed-source component.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability is a security issue in a closed-source component provided by Qualcomm."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of the vulnerability is not explicitly stated beyond being a High severity issue. However, given that it's a closed-source component and a 'High' severity rating, the potential impact would likely include the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, which could lead to privilege escalation, data theft, or device compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "The attack vector is not defined but, based on the nature of closed-source component vulnerabilities, could involve exploitation through crafted inputs or specific conditions. This component is not publicly accessible, which requires a specific path or method to trigger the vulnerability."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The capabilities required to exploit this are not fully stated, but they would likely include a way to interact with or trigger the closed-source component through the device, making exploitation likely dependent on a combination of specific inputs, conditions, or network interaction and require some form of local or remote code execution capability."
