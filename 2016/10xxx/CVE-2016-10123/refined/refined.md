Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-10123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from allowing non-privileged users to use the `--chroot` option without proper seccomp support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of seccomp filtering when using the `--chroot` option for non-privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A non-privileged user could potentially escalate their privileges to root by exploiting the missing seccomp protection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `--chroot` command-line option when invoked by a non-privileged user on systems lacking seccomp support.
- The attacker could create a specially crafted chroot environment and use a setuid binary to gain elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on a system using the vulnerable version of Firejail, without seccomp support
- The ability to execute `firejail` with the `--chroot` option.
- The ability to prepare a chroot directory with exploitable binaries like sudo.

**Additional Information:**
- This issue was fixed by commit `a23ac1bf390fa4c3db4ea31e6ee6100a9c511d59` which prevents the use of the `--chroot` option for non-privileged users when seccomp is not supported.
