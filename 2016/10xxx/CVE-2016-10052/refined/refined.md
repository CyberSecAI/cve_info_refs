Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-10052:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `WriteProfile` function within the `coders/jpeg.c` file of ImageMagick. This occurs during the processing of EXIF profiles in JPEG images. Specifically, when the size of an EXIF profile exceeds a certain limit (65533 bytes), the code attempts to truncate it, but a flaw in the logic causes a write beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of large EXIF profiles.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted file can cause the application to crash.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description also mentions the possibility of other, unspecified, impacts. The provided Suse information states that arbitrary code execution could occur.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted JPEG image file containing a large EXIF profile.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to make the vulnerable application process a malicious JPEG image file.
*   No specific authentication or privileges are required.
*   User interaction is required, such as opening a malicious file.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **SUSE:** SUSE's information indicates that a crafted XML file is used to trigger the vulnerability and that it was rated as having moderate severity, with a CVSSv2 base score of 5.8 and a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8.
*   **GitHub commit:** The GitHub commit [13267a1](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/13267a10845a8dadabed63072b537f050cec6daa) shows the code changes made to mitigate the issue. This commit adds a check to ensure the EXIF profile size does not exceed the 65533 byte limit. If it does, a warning message is generated, and the profile is truncated.
*   **Red Hat:** The Red Hat bugzilla entry ([1410459](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1410459)) confirms the vulnerability as an out-of-bounds write in the exif (jpeg) reader and that it is fixed in ImageMagick 6.9.5.
*   **Debian:** The Debian bug report ([836171](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=836171)) discusses the fix for a related divide-by-zero vulnerability in TIFF handling, and is not specific to CVE-2016-10052.
*   **OpenSUSE:** The openSUSE mailing list mentions that CVE-2016-10052 has been fixed by applying a bound check to the EXIF parser and the associated SUSE security advisories list fixed versions for several SUSE products and their respective packages.

**In summary:** The vulnerability lies in the JPEG coder of ImageMagick where an out-of-bounds write occurs due to a lack of proper handling of EXIF profile sizes. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious JPEG image that contains a larger-than-expected EXIF profile to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially have other, undefined impacts. Patches were made to truncate the profiles and raise a warning message.
