AFAICT, why not.

The su password is, remove the spaces:
z y a d 5 0 0 1

Interested in working with someone on this. I can't print hello in C, but have 20 amazon books on the subject. Also found the source code plus toolchain and playing around with compiling it. Readme said to use Fedora 11. No source code for any of the be\_modules files where I found it hiding in plain text. But I presume these are optional.

Btw, what is the timeout for writing a message, fourth time, smaller every time.

Ordinarily, I don't mind to participate in this discussion. However, I don't have this hardware. So, I just can't do much with the discussion. Sorry about this.

The password doesn't seem to work for telnet or ssh, just su and ftp. Iptables has a BACKDOOR rule. Rolled new firmware with lots of mistakes, like not setting permissions on busybox correctly, still booted, couldn't su. Assuming I didn't know the admin password, would clobbering shadow via ftp work or I just can't make a salted shadow to replace it?

According to the system log, some curious stranger was able to login after 10 tries via telnet, maybe they broke the default salted passwords. Contrary to the web gui settings, telnet seems to run at boot.

If you come across one of these and the label with password is missing, press and hold the reset button for 30 seconds and the web gui credentials will be reset to root root and configuration file is cleaner than with the short reset.

Good work on the su password.  I was working on a different approach, after looking for web vulnerabilities on the ping utility I was starting to dissect the firmware upgrade and looking for a way in.

Your way was much easier! ![smile](https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png)

The reason that you can't use that account to ssh is that the ssh agent does a lookup by appending \_404A03SSH to the user name when you try to login.  Ftp name mangles it as well and so does Tel.

You can verify this by creating a new user called test like this:

# adduser -h /root -s /bin/sh -H test\_404A03SSH

and then try to login via ssh with ssh test@192.168.0.1

your password will work.

Hey there. Sorry to revive an old thread, do you guys have an explanation on how to sign in, like what username, etc? I've tried admin, root, admin\_404A03SSH, root\_404A03SSH, and the password OP said doesn't work. I'm using PuTTY, and I've tried both Telnet and SSH. Thanks.

Any movement on this?  @occupymyday.... you feel like posting that link to the buildtree?  I'm thinking this might be worth a little bit of fun! ![smile](https://forum.openwrt.org/img/smilies/smile.png)

Sorry for waking up an ancient thread.

But. We just got a new PK5001Z (to replace an EQ-660R, ancient!), and I'd like to poke around with it a bit. I have decent knowledge of C, good knowledge of Linux workings, and some hardware hacking knowledge. Is there any particular reason that OpenWrt isn't available for the PK5001Z yet? AFAIK, that is the standard router given out by CenturyLink nowadays, and it'd be awesome to have OpenWrt for it.

Also, the root password is still z y a d 5 0 0 1, and the user and admin passwords are both CenturyL.

In response to recent IoT botnet attacks ([https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/sec … e-wildfire](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/new-mirai-variant-found-spreading-like-wildfire)), it appears that CenturyLink/ZyXEL has rolled a new firmware out remotely (compiled December 4th) without asking anyone or updating their website. It seems they changed all the passwords (root and to the super-secret support console at <http://192.168.0.1/supportconsole_login.cgi>), and now the file that sets all the passwords (/lib/be\_modules/libberemotemgmt6.so) no longer has the passwords in plaintext. New libberemotemgmt6.so file is at <https://my.mixtape.moe/oftykr.so> if anyone wants to try reverse-engineering it to see how it sets the passwords; too lazy to get a MIPS toolchain running to disassemble it.

The old web interface hack to get root still works: log in and go to [http://192.168.0.1/pingtrace.cgi?pingSi … %20root%60](http://192.168.0.1/pingtrace.cgi?pingSize=32&pingAddr=%60passwd%20-d%20root%60)

sorry this post is a mess

EDIT: An old post about this router/modem combo got deleted for some reason; it was at <https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43210>. I'm guessing this was unintentional (lost in transition to new forum software maybe), but could a moderator or administrator please look up this post? I would like to see what was in it again.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
