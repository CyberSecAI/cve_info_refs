Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The ZyXEL PK5001Z modem has a hardcoded "su" password ("zyad5001") and default "admin" telnet password ("CenturyL1nk").
*   The device's SSH daemon performs username mangling by appending "_404A03SSH" to usernames before authentication, preventing the use of the hardcoded "su" password via SSH without the mangled username. Telnet and FTP also perform similar username mangling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The modem contains hardcoded passwords for the "admin" user and the "su" command.
*   **Backdoor Account:** The hardcoded "su" password enables direct root access via the su command, effectively creating a backdoor.
*   **Username Mangling:** While not a vulnerability itself, the username mangling obscures the simple use of root via ssh and telnet, hindering immediate exploitation and making the default admin user seem more secure than it is.
*   **Unnecessary Services:** Telnet is running by default, contrary to web UI settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full root access to the modem.
*   **Malware Installation:** Root access can be used to install malware, modify system settings, or perform further malicious activities.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially access and steal sensitive data stored on the device.
*   **Network Manipulation:** Compromised devices can be used as part of a botnet or to manipulate network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Telnet:** The hardcoded "admin" password can be used to gain access via Telnet, followed by using the hardcoded "su" password to gain root access.
*   **Local Access (su):** If an attacker gains limited access, they can elevate their privileges using the hardcoded "su" password, although this is unlikely the main attack vector.
*   **Web Interface (command injection):** The forum content mentions a command injection vulnerability in the web interface using `pingtrace.cgi` that can reset the root password, providing another way to gain root access. This isn't directly related to the hardcoded password vulnerability but it is a related vulnerability in the same device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the modem, typically within the local network or via a port forwarding rule from the internet (if configured).
*   **Basic Networking Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to use tools like Telnet and be familiar with basic Linux commands.
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker requires knowledge of the hardcoded credentials for exploitation, as documented in the exploit-db entry.

**Additional Notes**
*   The forum content mentions that CenturyLink/ZyXEL released a firmware update to address this.
*   The exploit-db entry provides proof of concept commands and outputs.
