```

With the **Booking Calendar Contact Form** you can create a **booking form with a reservation calendar** or a **payment form** connected to a PayPal payment button. The reservation calendar lets the customer select the start (ex: check-in) and end (ex: checkout) dates.

The **reservation calendar** is an optional item, so it can be disabled to create a **general purpose payment/contact form**.

There are two types of bookings available in the calendar configuration: full day bookings or partial day bookings. With full day bookings the whole day is blocked / reserved while in partial day bookings the start and end dates are partially blocked as used for example in **room/hotel bookings**.

Features:

* **Booking form** connected to PayPal: After clicking the reservation / book button on the booking form, the user is redirected to PayPal and after completing the payment three emails will be sent: the automatic PayPal notification, the booking confirmation email to the user sent from the website and the notification email to the website administrator containing the booking details. At this point the booking will be confirmed and will appear in the bookings list and calendar.
* **Reservation / booking calendar** with optional availability verification: The dates are blocked in the calendar only if the “bookings overlap” option is enabled (it’s enabled by default).
* **Season management:** Configuration accepts different prices for different dates (ex: low / medium / high season prices, special date’s prices, etc…)
* Supports **full-day bookings** or **partial day bookings** as used in hotels / room reservations (details mentioned above)
* Allows to disable/hide the booking calendar to convert the booking form in a **general purpose contact form**
* The calendar an form are fully responsive and mobile optimized

Other features also present in this version:

* Built-in captcha anti-spam protection on the booking form
* Easy visual selection of the start and end dates
* Configurable email texts
* Configurable validation messages
* Lets to assign a user to the calendar, this way a user with editor access will access his/her own booking calendar
* List of bookings with print option
* Supports bookings of a fixed length, example weekly bookings
* Price structure can be defined for each number of days
* Calendar configurable settings: date format, min/max dates, block dates, mark holidays, select working weekdays, calendar pages

What isn’t included in the free version described here?

* The Form Builder for customizing the form is present only in the commercial versions. The free version works with the classic predefined form included on it.
* Full iCal sync available in Platinum version
* Coupons/discount codes and other minor features are present only in the commercial versions.

#### Troubleshoot Area

The “Troubleshoot Area” is located below the booking calendars list.

Important!: Use the “Troubleshoot Area” area only if you are experiencing conflicts with third party plugins, with the theme scripts or with the character encoding.

*Script load method:* Change the script load method if the booking form doesn’t appear in the public website. In most cases changing the booking form load method to “direct” will solve the problem, however if possible leave the default setting “classic”.

*Character encoding:* Update the charset if you are getting problems displaying special/non-latin characters in the booking form, reservation emails or booking list. After updated you need to edit/enter the special characters again.

#### Min and max number of nights to be booked

There are two new settings in the booking calendar administration area:

*Minimum number of nights to be booked:* If set to a number greater than zero, the booking form won’t accept bookings of less than the indicated nights.

*Maximum number of nights to be booked:* The booking form won’t accept booking of more than the indicated nights in this field.

#### Supplement for specific bookings

You can apply supplements for bookings under some specific number of nights, or over a specified number of nights, or both.

The field “*Supplement for bookings between X and Y nights*” makes the booking form add the specified supplement once for bookings between the indicated number of nights.

#### Settings for both admin and public calendars

* Calendar Pages: Number of calendar months to display at the same time
* Calendar Language: Language used for the calendar. The default is auto-detect that works in most cases. If the auto-detect doesn’t get the expected language then select it manually.
* Start Weekday: Start weekday, usually Sunday or Monday.
* Date format: Select dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy
* Accept overlapped reservations: Indicate if more than one reservation will be allowed in the same days. Default is “no overlapped” for an active availability verification.
* Reservation mode: Select Complete day means that the first and the last days booked are charged as full days; Partial Day means that they are charged as half-days only.

#### Settings for public calendar only

* Minimum available date: The minimum selectable date in the calendar. Examples: 2012-10-25, today, today + 3 days
* Maximum available date: The maximum selectable date in the calendar.
* Minimum number of nights to be booked: The booking form won’t accept less than the indicated nights on this field.
* Maximum number of nights to be booked: The booking form won’t accept more than the indicated nights on this field.
* Working dates: Working dates are the dates that accept bookings. Use this for example to disable the weekends or other specific weekdays.
* Disabled and special dates: Click a date to mark it as disabled, for example for disabling holidays or other dates where reservations aren’t allowed.
* Enable Fixed Reservation Length?: Use this for allowing only bookings of a specific number of days. More details in the next section

#### Fixed Reservation Length

If you enable the option “Fixed Reservation Length” for the calendar that means that you want to accept only bookings of the specified length (number of days), for example for accepting only 7 days bookings.

The settings fields for this option are:

* Fixed reservation length (days): The number of days that must have the booking.
* Start Reservation Date: Use this for allowing specific weekdays as start of the reservation, for example if you want to indicate that all the bookings must start on a Monday.
* Disabled and special dates: When the “Fixed Reservation Length” is enabled you can use the calendar for indicating specific starting days for the bookings. This is useful if you are offering packages that start only on specific dates.

When this mode is enabled, the customer only has to select the start day for the booking and the end date is calculated automatically.

#### Form Builder

The form builder is fully available only in the commercial versions. If allows to fully customizing the form: add, edit and remove fields.

#### Submit Button

There is an area to indicate the label used for the submit button. The class=”pbSubmit” can be used to modify the button styles. The styles can be added into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of calendars): For further modifications the submit button is located at the end of the file “dex\_scheduler.inc.php”.

## FAQ

### Q: What means each field in the settings area?

A: The product’s page contains detailed information about each field and customization:

https://bccf.dwbooster.com/documentation

### Q: Can I customize the booking calendar colors?

A: This and other questions are already answered in the product’s FAQ at this page:

https://bccf.dwbooster.com/faq

### Q: How to disable the accommodation availability verification?

A: In the booking calendar administration area, set the field “Accept overlapped reservations?” to “No”, this way the accommodation availability verification will be disabled. Note that the calendar will disappear from the admin area when you select this setting since its purpose is to define the available days for booking.

### Q: When is blocked the reservation and sent the email with the rental information?

A: After clicking the submit / booking button the customer is redirected to a PayPal payment page to submit the payment to confirm it. After completed the payment the reservation is saved into the database and calendar, the dates become un-available it the booking availability verification is enabled and the emails are sent with the booking information and the information entered by the customer on the booking form. At that point the booking information will appear also in the printable bookings list.

### Q: Got this error message at PayPal after clicking the book button: “We cannot process this transaction…”. Solution?

A: Into the Booking Calendar Contact Form settings >> PayPal payment form configuration >> PayPal email, be sure to put your own PayPal email address instead the email placeholder put there as default.

### Q: How to translate the plugin texts?

A: If you don’t want to edit the MO/PO files then just edit the texts that are at the beginning of the file “dex\_scheduler.inc.php” (the booking page). The booking form validation texts can be edited from the administration area.

### Q: Can I restrict the number of days to book?

A: Yes, use the settings fields “Minimum number of nights to be booked” and “Maximum number of nights to be booked” for that purpose. You can also specify a fixed reservation length if you want to allow only bookings of a specific number of days.

### Q: The booking calendar form doesn’t appear. Solution?

A: If the booking calendar form doesn’t appear in the public website (in some cases only the captcha appear) then change the script load method to direct, this is the solution in most cases.

That can be changed in the “troubleshoot area” located below the list of booking calendars/items.

### Q: Can the booking calendar notification emails be customized?

A: In addition to the possibility of editing the email contents you can use the following tags:

* **<%itemnumber%>:** Request ID.

* **<%totalcost%%>:** Total cost.

It looks a free version, but is is not, because only after installation of this “free” version and setting up you find (at your first test booking) that this system is linked to the PayPal-system. This means that it cannot be freely used; customers abroad may not support the PayPal payment method, and therefore it is useless.
At least, this should have been clearly marked before one starts to install.
The alternative, of course, is the paid version… probably this is the ultimate goal…

This kind of “developers” are killing the the WP! The guy is selling you a free calender with no option to display it in the front page (or even see what it would look like!). So, to be able to do the last I should pay this guy more money than I paid for a Domain name, hosting space and for one of the best selling WP template TOGETHER!!?? So now dear WP go and figure this guys out! One really should be able to remove such “developers” from the WP platform completely before they turn it in to the trash platform!

This is a decent, adaptable plugin. It’s not the least expensive, yet you get what you pay for. The schedule and booking structure looks better than a almost all of the other plugins.
