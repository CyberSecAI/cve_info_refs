Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The default Apache HTTP Server configuration bundled with ZoneMinder had directory indexing enabled. This allowed unauthorized access to browse directories in the web root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Listing Enabled:**  The primary weakness was the presence of `Options Indexes` in the Apache configuration. This allowed anyone to view the contents of directories if an index file wasn't present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker could browse all directories in the web root. This includes viewing CCTV images stored on the server.
- **Auth bypass:** The issue also allowed for an authentication bypass because an attacker could directly access files without needing login credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely by an attacker without any prior authentication. The attacker simply had to access the server via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needed network access to the ZoneMinder server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior knowledge or authentication was needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Knowledge of basic HTTP requests was needed, specifically to access the exposed directory.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** ZoneMinder versions 1.30 and 1.29 were affected.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involved removing the `Indexes` option from the Apache configuration files, preventing directory listing. This change was implemented in the provided commit link
  `<https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/commit/71898df7565ed2a51dfe76a1cf30ddb81fc888ba>`

- **Proof of Concept:** The vulnerability could be demonstrated by navigating to a directory on the ZoneMinder server such as `http://<serverIP>/events`. This would display a directory listing to anyone, regardless of authentication.
