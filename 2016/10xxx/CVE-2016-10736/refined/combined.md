## Advisory:

# Reflected XSS in Social Pug – Easy Social Share Buttons could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can

## Vulnerability

Last revised: December 7, 2016

This plugin takes input from $\_GET and puts it directly into HTML without escaping it. This means that anybody who is able to convince an admin user to click on a link would be able to take control of their browser on that domain name and delete posts, add new admin users, etc..

Current state:
 Fixed
