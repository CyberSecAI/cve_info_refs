- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin takes input from the `_GET` request parameters and puts it directly into HTML without proper escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the `dpsp_message_class` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as deleting posts, adding new admin users, and other administrative tasks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in administrator to click on it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and needs to trick an admin user into visiting it while they are logged in to the vulnerable application.
