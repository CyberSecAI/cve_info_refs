Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure default permissions assigned to several directories when mounted within the Firejail sandbox. Specifically, `/dev`, `/dev/shm`, `/var/tmp`, and `/var/lock` were mounted with `0777` permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Permissions:** Mounting directories with `0777` permissions allows any user within the sandbox to read, write, and execute files in those directories, regardless of their original permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially exploit these weak permissions to escalate their privileges to root. They could do this by creating or modifying files within these directories and leveraging them to execute code as a privileged user. The provided text refers to an example of privilege escalation using a system utility, possibly by exploiting setuid functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to be able to execute commands inside a firejail sandbox.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file system inside the Firejail sandbox due to the vulnerable permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user capable of executing Firejail with the vulnerable configuration, meaning that the vulnerable commit has to be in place and that an admin did not mitigate this vulnerability by using a secure configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is related to the use of Firejail. Firejail is a sandboxing program. The fix is related to a commit which changed the permissions of the mentioned directories.
- The email thread also discusses other related vulnerabilities, but they are addressed by different CVEs.
- The specific exploit for this vulnerability isn't fully detailed in the provided text. However, the example given highlights the ease of privilege escalation within the sandbox due to the weak permissions.
