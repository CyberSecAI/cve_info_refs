- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Brafton WordPress plugin's `BraftonAdminPage.php` file directly outputs the value of the `tab` parameter from the `$_GET` array into the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the WordPress admin page for the Brafton plugin with a crafted `tab` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerable code is in `wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=BraftonArticleLoader&tab=[malicious_code]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the `tab` parameter containing JavaScript code and lure a logged-in WordPress admin user to visit the URL.
