Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10071:

**Root Cause:**
- Out-of-bounds read in the `mat.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A maliciously crafted file could cause the application to crash due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file that exploits the flaw in the `mat.c` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file that is processed by ImageMagick. This could be done through a variety of methods depending on how the application using ImageMagick is deployed, such as by tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or through an attack on a web service.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was fixed in ImageMagick version 6.9.4.
- The fix involves a change in the allocation size for `BImgBuff` from `sizeof(unsigned char)` to `sizeof(double)`

- This is related to Debian bug #845246.
- Upstream issue is at: `https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/131`
- Upstream patch is at: `https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/f3b483e8b054c50149912523b4773687e18afe25`
