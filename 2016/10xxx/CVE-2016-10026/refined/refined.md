Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how ikiwiki handles reverts on sites using Git for version control, the `recentchanges` plugin, and the CGI interface. The core issue is that `git revert` command will follow renames by default, but ikiwiki's authorization checks did not account for this. Specifically:

1.  **Page Renames:** When a page is renamed within the Git repository, `git revert` will apply changes to the file's *new* location, not just where the file existed when the commit was made.
2.  **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** ikiwiki's authorization checks for reverts only looked at the file paths from the commit history before the file was renamed. It was not verifying the user has permissions to edit the files in their *current* location.
3.  **Bypass:** This allowed an attacker to bypass editing restrictions by reverting a commit made when they *did* have permission to edit a file, even if they no longer have permission to edit that file in its new location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Logic:** The primary weakness is the flawed logic in ikiwiki's authorization checks for reverts. It did not correctly determine the current location of files being reverted and their permission.
*   **Git Behavior Misunderstanding:** The code did not adequately consider `git revert`'s behavior regarding following renames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Editing Restriction Bypass:** An attacker could revert changes to a page they are not authorized to edit.
*   **Data Modification:** This would lead to unauthorized modification of wiki page content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface (CGI):** The primary attack vector was the web interface. The `recentchanges` plugin displays links that allow reverting commits.
*   **Git:** Attackers would need to manipulate page locations in the git repository (i.e. rename a page) and then exploit the revert functionality via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account on the ikiwiki instance.
*   **Limited Permissions:** The attacker needs to have had permission to edit a page at some point, but now not have permission to edit it at its current location.
*   **Git Access (Indirectly):** They don't need direct Git access but need to be able to cause page renames to happen to exploit the vulnerability via the web interface.

**More details than the official CVE description:**

The provided content gives significant insight into the vulnerability, which is not readily available in the CVE description. Specifically:

*   It details the specific scenario involving renaming files and how the vulnerability arises in the `git revert` process.
*   It provides context that this occurs when the `git` and `recentchanges` plugins are enabled in conjunction with the CGI interface.
*   It references the specific commit that fixes the issue
*   It highlights that a partial fix was implemented in version 3.20161219, but was not effective with git versions older than 2.8.0.

In summary, CVE-2016-10026 allowed for a bypass of editing restrictions due to an incorrect understanding of how `git revert` works in combination with page renames. This was a significant security issue as it allowed unauthorized users to modify protected content on the wiki.
