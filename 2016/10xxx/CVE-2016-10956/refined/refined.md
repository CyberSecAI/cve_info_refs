Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10956 (based on the content from cxsecurity.com, though the CVE is not explicitly mentioned, the vulnerability details align.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of the `include()` function in the `mail-masta` WordPress plugin. The plugin directly includes user-supplied input from the `pl` parameter without proper validation or sanitization. Specifically, the following files are vulnerable:
- `/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php`
- `/inc/lists/csvexport.php`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is an LFI, where an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem via the `pl` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, or even system files like `/etc/passwd`. This can lead to further attacks and system compromise.
- **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** Although not explicitly stated, in some cases LFI can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve RCE if the included file contains PHP code or has execution permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET requests by crafting a URL that contains the `pl` parameter with a path to the file the attacker wishes to include.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is explicitly stated to be required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The cxsecurity.com content provides specific vulnerable lines of code, `include($_GET['pl']);`, making the LFI vulnerability explicit. It also provides a proof-of-concept URL `http://megacorp/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd` as an example of how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The WordPress.org content shows the plugin was closed on September 19, 2014 and is no longer available for download. The review section contains a user report from September 3, 2016, about the 'Add Campaign' button not working, which suggests that users were still using or attempting to use the plugin after it was closed.
