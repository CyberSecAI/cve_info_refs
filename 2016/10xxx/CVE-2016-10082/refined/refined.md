{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the 'dbType' parameter received via POST. This parameter is directly used in an include_once statement, which can lead to file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsanitized user input, file inclusion vulnerability, remote code execution (RCE) potential.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server into the application's execution scope, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can send a crafted POST request with a malicious 'dbType' parameter to the `serendipity_checkInstallation()` function in `include/functions_installer.inc.php` during the installation process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application, specifically during the installation phase."
