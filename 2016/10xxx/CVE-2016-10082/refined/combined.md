## Description

[![@Shinkurt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9161100?u=5a8e1895af9ba9d5c552b59fb09e6e50e4c7455b&v=4&size=48)](/Shinkurt)[Shinkurt](https://github.com/Shinkurt)opened [on Dec 18, 2016](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/issues/433#issue-196308381)

Hello,

In bundled-libs/serendipity\_generateFTPChecksums.php

640: $serendipity['dbType'] = $\_POST['dbType'];

643: include\_once (S9Y\_INCLUDE\_PATH . "include/db/{$serendipity['dbType']}.inc.php");

As you can see a user-controlled variable, $serendipity['dbType'], is being sent to an include\_once() function without any sanitization call, which results in file inclusion and a remote code execution by referring to any file with php payload in older PHP versions where nullbytes (%00) are allowed.

Thanks,
