Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `readContigStripsIntoBuffer()` function within `tools/tiffcrop.c`. The function increments the output buffer pointer (`bufp`) incorrectly when handling images in "-i" (ignore) mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Due to incorrect buffer pointer increment, a crafted TIFF image can cause the `readContigStripsIntoBuffer()` to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundary, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-based buffer overflows can often be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to potentially gain control of the system.
- **Denial of Service:** Overwriting memory can also lead to application crashes and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted TIFF image:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted TIFF image using the `tiffcrop` tool with the `-i` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply a crafted TIFF image:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable application (`tiffcrop`) for processing.
- **Use the -i option:** The `-i` option needs to be used when invoking the vulnerable `tiffcrop` tool.

**Additional details from blog post:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
- The specific commit that addresses this issue is: `https://github.com/vadz/libtiff/commit/9657bbe3cdce4aaa90e07d50c1c70ae52da0ba6a`
- The blog post provides a reproducer: `https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00100-libtiff-heapoverflow-_TIFFFax3fillruns`
- The blog post provides a stack trace showing the overflow happening in `_TIFFFax3fillruns`, while the github commit description says it happens in  `readContigStripsIntoBuffer()`. This suggests the root cause may be in `readContigStripsIntoBuffer()` but the actual overflow may be occuring in different code based on context.

The vulnerability was present in libtiff version 4.0.7 and was fixed by commit `9657bbe3cdce4aaa90e07d50c1c70ae52da0ba6a`.
