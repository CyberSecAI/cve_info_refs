### Analysis of Content Related to CVE-2016-10723
The provided content discusses a patch for a Linux kernel issue related to the out-of-memory (OOM) killer and memory allocation. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content provides enough information to analyze the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The issue arises when multiple threads are concurrently trying to allocate memory, leading to direct reclaim. If the OOM killer is invoked, it can be preempted by other threads, preventing it from effectively killing processes and releasing memory. This results in a deadlock or prolonged stall while the system waits for memory to free up.
- The core of the problem lies in the fact that a thread that fails to allocate memory may invoke `out_of_memory` and start the OOM killer. If the OOM killer is preempted and cannot make progress, other memory allocation attempts may trigger the OOM killer again, eventually leading to a deadlock or long delay while the system waits for a previous OOM victim to release resources
- Specifically, the `schedule_timeout_killable()` call within `out_of_memory()` while holding `oom_lock` can lead to lock contention issues and hinder the OOM killer progress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lock Contention:** The `oom_lock` is held while a thread waits for a killed process to exit. If the thread holding the lock is preempted, other threads attempting to allocate memory may get stuck waiting for the lock.
- **Preemption of OOM Killer:** The OOM killer can be preempted by other threads, preventing it from completing its task of freeing up memory and making the OOM situation worse, potentially leading to a system-wide stall.
- **Ineffective Direct Reclaim:** Threads consuming CPU time in pointless direct reclaim make the situation worse and cause further delays by not giving the OOM killer and victim threads resources to free up memory.
- **Incorrect Sleep Behavior:** Sleep calls inside the OOM path are inconsistent. A thread may sleep with the oom_lock held, exacerbating lock contention problems. Also, some threads would retry memory allocation without any sleep.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Stall:** The primary impact is a system stall, where the kernel is unable to allocate memory due to the OOM killer being blocked. This can lead to the system becoming unresponsive.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system becomes effectively unusable when this occurs.
- **Delayed OOM handling**: Processes that are selected for being killed by the OOM killer may not be killed in time, worsening the memory pressure situation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The vulnerability is triggered by causing the system to run out of memory through many concurrent memory allocation requests from multiple threads/processes.
- **CPU Pressure:** The problem is exacerbated when the system is also under CPU pressure, which increases the chances of the OOM killer being preempted and the `oom_lock` being held for extended periods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger memory allocation within the system. This could be achieved through running multiple memory-intensive processes or exploiting a memory leak in a running process, which can be triggered through various attack vectors such as network, disk and filesystem.
- The attacker needs to create enough CPU load to cause the OOM killer to be preempted, by creating many threads doing direct reclaim.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided patch attempts to mitigate the lockup by:
    - Moving the `schedule_timeout_killable()` call outside of the `oom_lock` region in `out_of_memory()` and calling it after releasing the lock, this prevents the OOM killer thread itself from blocking on the lock and prevents lock contention, ensuring that the OOM reaper thread can acquire the lock and unmap memory.
    - Adding a `schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1)` when the allocation fails due to an out-of-memory condition.
    - It adds a short sleep to the `gfp_pfmemalloc_allowed` function when `did_some_progress` is set, in order to give the OOM killer some time to reclaim memory.
    - It explicitly waits on `oom_lock` before retrying allocation in `__alloc_pages_may_oom()`, helping the OOM killer make progress.

This content provides more details and context than a typical CVE description, including a reproducer, logs and a patch.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the kernel's OOM handling and memory allocation paths, where lock contention and preemption can cause stalls. An attacker capable of causing memory exhaustion can cause the system to become unresponsive. The provided patch attempts to mitigate the issue by adjusting sleep and locking behavior to improve the OOM killer's ability to free up resources.

The patch changes aim to mitigate the issue but are also under discussion for possible improvements and clarifications.
