OK. Since "mm, oom: fix concurrent munlock and oom reaper unmap, v3" went to
linux.git as 27ae357fa82be5ab, it is time to resume this patch. I do hope that
you don't ignore me again...

Here is the reproducer of OOM lockup.
Note that I'm not using hundreds of concurrent memory allocating threads.

Once a thread which called out_of_memory() started sleeping at schedule_timeout_killable(1)

Subject: [PATCH] mm,oom: Don't call schedule_timeout_killable() with oom_lock held.

When I was examining a bug which occurs under CPU + memory pressure, I
observed that a thread which called out_of_memory() can sleep for minutes
at schedule_timeout_killable(1) with oom_lock held when many threads are
doing direct reclaim.

The whole point of the sleep is give the OOM victim some time to exit.
But since commit 27ae357fa82be5ab ("mm, oom: fix concurrent munlock and
oom reaper unmap, v3") changed the OOM victim to wait for oom_lock in order
to close race window at exit_mmap(), the whole point of this sleep is lost
now. We need to make sure that the thread which called out_of_memory() will
release oom_lock shortly. Therefore, this patch brings the sleep to outside
of the OOM path.

We already do have that sleep for PF_WQ_WORKER in should_reclaim_retry.
Why do we need it here as well?

Because that path depends on __zone_watermark_ok() == true which is not
guaranteed to be executed.

I consider that this "goto retry;" is a good location for making a short sleep.
Current code is so conditional that there are cases which needlessly retry
without sleeping (e.g. current thread finds an OOM victim at select_bad_process()
and immediately retries allocation attempt rather than giving the OOM victim
CPU resource for releasing memory) or needlessly sleep (e.g. current thread
was selected as an OOM victim but mutex_trylock(&oom_lock) in
__alloc_pages_may_oom() failed).

Is there any reason we cannot do the special cased sleep for
PF_WQ_WORKER in should_reclaim_retry? The current code is complex enough
to make it even more so. If we need a hack for PF_WQ_WORKER case then we
definitely want to have a single place to do so.

I don't understand why you are talking about PF_WQ_WORKER case.

This sleep is not only for PF_WQ_WORKER case but also !PF_KTHREAD case.
I added this comment because you suggested simply removing any sleep which
waits for the OOM victim.

Making special cased sleep for PF_WQ_WORKER in should_reclaim_retry() cannot
become a reason to block this patch. You can propose it after this patch is
applied. This patch is for mitigating lockup problem caused by forever holding
oom_lock.

Because that seems to be the reason to have it there as per your
comment.

And now you have made the comment misleading and I suspect it is just
not really needed as well.

You are fiddling with other code paths at the same time so I _do_ care.
Spilling random code without a proper explanation is just not going to
fly.

OK. Then, I will fold below change into my patch.

backport my patch? Or, do you want to apply a fix (which eliminates "delay" and
"out:" from linux-next) prior to my patch?

Do you really need this? You are still fiddling with this path at all? I
see how removing the timeout might be reasonable after recent changes
but why do you insist in adding it outside of the lock.

Sigh... We can't remove this sleep without further changes. That's why I added

 * This schedule_timeout_*() serves as a guaranteed sleep for
 * PF_WQ_WORKER threads when __zone_watermark_ok() == false.

so that we won't by error remove this sleep without further changes.

This sleep is not only for waiting for OOM victims. Any thread who is holding
oom_lock needs CPU resources in order to make forward progress.

If oom_notify_list callbacks are registered, this sleep helps the owner of
oom_lock to reclaim memory by processing the callbacks.

If oom_notify_list callbacks did not release memory, this sleep still helps
the owner of oom_lock to check whether there is inflight OOM victims.

If there is no inflight OOM victims, this sleep still helps the owner of
oom_lock to select a new OOM victim and call printk().

If there are already inflight OOM victims, this sleep still helps the OOM
reaper and the OOM victims to release memory.

Printing messages to consoles and reclaiming memory need CPU resources.
More reliable way is to use mutex_lock_killable(&oom_lock) instead of
mutex_trylock(&oom_lock) in __alloc_pages_may_oom(), but I'm giving way
for now. There is no valid reason for removing this sleep now.

Look. I am fed up with this discussion. You are fiddling with the code
and moving hacks around with a lot of hand waving. Rahter than trying to
look at the underlying problem. Your patch completely ignores PREEMPT as
I've mentioned in previous versions.

I do admit that the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle and it
requires a deeper consideration. Fair enough. You can spend that time on
the matter and come up with something clever. That would be great. But
moving a sleep around because of some yada yada yada is not a way we
want to treat this code.

I would be OK with removing the sleep from the out_of_memory path based
on your argumentation that we have a _proper_ synchronization with the
exit path now. That would be a patch that has actually a solid
background behind. Is it possible that something would wait longer or
wouldn't preempt etc.? Yes possible but those need to be analyzed and
thing through properly. See the difference from "we may need it because
we've always been doing that and there is here and there that might
happen". This cargo cult way of programming will only grow more and more
hacks nobody can reason about long term.

I'm not ignoring PREEMPT. To fix this OOM lockup problem properly, as much
efforts as fixing Spectre/Meltdown problems will be required. This patch is
a mitigation for regression introduced by fixing CVE-2018-1000200. Nothing
is good with deferring this patch.

Such attempt should be made in a separate patch.

You suggested removing this sleep from my patch without realizing that
we need explicit schedule_timeout_*() for PF_WQ_WORKER threads. My patch
is trying to be as conservative/safe as possible (for easier backport)
while reducing the risk of falling into OOM lockup.

I worry that you are completely overlooking

                char *fmt, ...)
 	 */
 	if (!mutex_trylock(&oom_lock)) {
 		*did_some_progress = 1;
-		schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1);
 		return NULL;
 	}

part in this patch.

Currently, the short sleep is so random/inconsistent that
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) is called when we failed to grab
oom_lock (even if current thread was already marked as an OOM victim),
schedule_timeout_killable(1) is called when we killed a new OOM victim,
and no sleep at all if we found that there are inflight OOM victims.

This patch centralized the location to call
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) to "goto retry;" path so that
current thread surely yields CPU resource to the owner of oom_lock.

You are free to propose removing this centralized sleep after my change
is applied. Of course, you are responsible for convincing that removing
this centralized sleep (unless PF_WQ_WORKER threads) does not negatively
affect the owner of oom_lock (e.g. a SCHED_IDLE thread who is holding

And that sleep is in should_reclaim_retry. If that is not sufficient it
should be addressed rather than spilling more of that crud all over the
place.

I am not. But it doesn't really make much sense to convince you if you
are not reading what I am writing. I am done with this thread.
Discussion is just a waste of time.

Then, please show me (by writing a patch yourself) how to tell whether
we should sleep there. What I can come up is shown below.

As far as I know, whether a domain which the current thread belongs to is
already OOM is not known as of should_reclaim_retry(). Therefore, sleeping
there can become a pointless delay if the domain which the current thread
belongs to and the domain which the owner of oom_lock (it can be a random
thread inside out_of_memory() or exit_mmap()) belongs to differs.

But you insist sleeping there means that you don't care about such
pointless delay?

```
If the OOM killer is invoked when many threads are looping inside the
page allocator, it is possible that the OOM killer is preempted by other
threads. As a result, the OOM killer is unable to send SIGKILL to OOM
victims and/or wake up the OOM reaper by releasing oom_lock for minutes
because other threads consume a lot of CPU time for pointless direct
reclaim.

----------

This patch adds extra sleeps which is effectively equivalent to

  if (mutex_lock_killable(&oom_lock) == 0)
    mutex_unlock(&oom_lock);

before retrying allocation at __alloc_pages_may_oom() so that the
OOM killer is not preempted by other threads waiting for the OOM
killer/reaper to reclaim memory. Since the OOM reaper grabs oom_lock
due to commit e2fe14564d3316d1 ("oom_reaper: close race with exiting
task"), waking up other threads before the OOM reaper is woken up by
directly waiting for oom_lock might not help so much.
