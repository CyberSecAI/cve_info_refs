Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2016-10371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an assertion failure in the `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagCheckedRational` function within the libtiff library. This assertion triggers when the function receives a negative value, which it is not designed to handle. While the code includes a check for `value <= 0.0`, the assertion `value >= 0.0` still causes a program termination when a negative value is encountered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Assertion Failure:** The primary vulnerability lies in the inappropriate use of an assertion to check for a condition that the code already handles.
- **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** The code should handle cases where a negative value is encountered and should return an error instead of asserting.
- **Malformed TIFF Handling:** The underlying issue occurs with malformed TIFF files, which cause the generation of a negative value when writing rational values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition. An attacker can provide specially crafted TIFF files which contain a negative rational value which will trigger the assertion causing the application to crash.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The USN-3602-1 notice suggests a possibility of arbitrary code execution with user privileges but this isn't explicitly detailed or shown by the other bugzilla tickets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed TIFF Files:**  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious TIFF image files, specifically those that lead to the generation of negative rational values when writing directory entries. This can be achieved by manipulating the internal structure of TIFF files and providing invalid values for specific tags.
- **User Interaction:** The attack vector relies on a user or automated system processing the malicious TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create/modify TIFF files:** The attacker needs the ability to create TIFF files, and specifically craft ones that lead to the negative rational values.
- **Ability to induce processing:** The attacker needs the ability to induce the target system to process the crafted file, which could involve social engineering, or through other methods depending on the target application and environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- Bug 2612 was marked as a duplicate of bug 2535, indicating they relate to the same underlying cause
- Bug 2535 shows the issue was fixed by replacing the assertion with a runtime check that handles the negative value and returns an error instead of crashing. It also mentions an extraneous `TIFFClose` in `tiffcrop.c`
- USN-3602-1 references CVE-2016-10371 and indicates that the vulnerability can lead to a crash and possibly arbitrary code execution.
- The fix was to remove the assertion and replace it with a runtime check, preventing a program crash.
