The provided content describes two vulnerabilities found in the Netgear EX7000 Wi-Fi Range Extender:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of SSID names when displayed in the network discovery list within the web interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The device's web interface does not properly sanitize SSID names, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the SSID.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an SSID name, which will then be executed when a user hovers their mouse over the network name in the device's web interface. This could lead to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser. As proof of concept, the author was able to create javascript code that reconfigured the device to create a new open wifi network called “FREEWIFI” and another that removes the password from the web interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to create a malicious SSID and have it be detected by the victim device. This can be accomplished by being in physical proximity to the victim device during setup, such that the malicious SSID appears in the device's network list.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Physical proximity to the device during setup is required so that the malicious SSID can be detected during network discovery. The attacker needs to control an SSID name.

**2. Insecure Storage of Credentials**

*   **Root Cause:** The "remember me" feature stores the username and password in cookies without setting the `httpOnly` flag.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The username and password of the device are stored as cookies in plaintext. These cookies are not set with the `httpOnly` flag, which makes them accessible to client-side JavaScript.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker with access to the device's cookies can extract the user's credentials. This could be a local attacker or the attacker leveraging the XSS vulnerability to steal the cookies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker with access to the browser cookies, either through local access or a separate web vulnerability such as the aforementioned XSS vulnerability, can obtain the stored credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker requires access to the cookies either through local means or other vulnerabilities such as the XSS.

The article also notes that Netgear was notified of the issue and released a firmware update that addresses the XSS issue. It also recommends that users not use the “remember me” function, and that the `httpOnly` flag needs to be used.
