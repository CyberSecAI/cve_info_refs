## Description

This is an unique chained / conditional logic quiz plugin that lets you create quizzes where the next question depends on the answer to the previous question.

**To publish a quiz place its shortcode in a post or page**

**[TRY LIVE DEMO](https://demo.pimteam.net/wp/which-is-the-right-quiz-plugin-for-you/ "Chained Quiz Demo")**

### Features

#### Create unlimited number of quizzes and questions

This free quiz plugin is fully functional: there is no limitation to the number of quizzes, questions or results you can have.

#### Questions support: single-choice, multiple-choice, open-end (essay)

The quiz will generate respectively a group of radio buttons, checkboxes, or a text area.

Even open-end (essay) questions can have possible answers that will be evaluated for match with the user’s answer.

#### Assign points to each answer

This is optional. The points will be summarized at the end to calculate final result.

#### Calculate result based on the points (unlimited number of results and from/to points)

Depending on how many points the user has collected you can assign a result and display different content at the end of the quiz.

The result can be used to give user recommendation, to direct them to another page, to offer them something to sell and so on.

#### Define what to do when specific answer is chosen

This is where the real magic of the chained quiz happens. You can define to go to next question in the quiz, go to a specific selected question, or finish the quiz.

#### Export user’s answers to a CSV file – with or without details

The CSV file can be used to analyze user results in Excel, import it in a database and so on.

If you are looking for a powerful regular quiz with sequential or randomized questions check out [Watu Quiz](https://wordpress.org/plugins/watu/ "Watu Quiz")

#### Go PRO with WatuPRO

The quizzes created with this plugin can be transferred to the most powerful WordPress tests suite [WatuPRO](http://calendarscripts.info/watupro/ "WatuPRO") where you can support chained logic via [this free addon](http://blog.calendarscripts.info/chained-quiz-logic-free-add-on-for-watupro/ "Chained Logic Addon").

This unique quiz plugin lets you guide the user through the questions in the way you want. It’s not only a very powerful tool for creating exams and quizzes, but can be used also to funnel a sales process depending on user’s selection.

### Integrated Plugins and Services

The plugin is integrated into several mailing list management plugins and services. This allows you to tie completing a quiz with a desired result with subscribing the respondent to a mailing list. From then you can send them marketing campaigns and so on.

Currently supported:

* [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/ "MailChimp Marketing Platform")
* [Arigato Auto responder and Newsletter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bft-autoresponder/ "Arigato Auto responder and Newsletter")
* [Arigato PRO](https://calendarscripts.info/bft-pro/ "Arigato PRO Autoresponder")

#### Developers API

We are just starting to add hooks, so stay tuned for detailed documentation. For now the main available hook is:

– “chained\_quiz\_completed” – sends the completion ID as argument to the call.

### Getting Started

Once activated the plugin go to Chained Quiz -> Quizzes in your WP dashboard and create your first quiz. After entering the quiz title, description and other settings you will be redirected to create the quiz results / outcomes. They define what happens after the user completes the quiz, depending on the points they collected from the different answers.

Creating results is optional but very powerful because you can present completely different content to the user depending on what path they took through the quiz and how many points were assigned to their answers. You can use the result description box for this result-dependent content or even redirect to another page.

After you create your results you will be redirected to creating the actual questions in the quiz. The answer to each question has an action which defines what happens if the user selects it: they can go to the next question, to a specific selected question (this is where the chaining magic happens), or to finalize the quiz.

Don’t forget that the conditional logic quiz must be **published** before it becomes accessible. Publishing happens when you manually place the shortcode of the quiz in a post or page or select the option “Automatically publish” when you save it.

\*\*\* Attention Multi-Site (WP Network) Users! \*\*\*

The plugin is perfectly compatible with multi-site installations but it should be activated as **blog admin** and NOT as superadmin.

  Here is how the different choices can be connected to different outcomes (plus assigning points at the same time)

  And of course you can define different results depending on the total points collected in the quiz

## Installation

1. Unzip the contents and upload the entire `chained-quiz` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Go to “Chained Quiz” in your menu and manage the plugin
4. To publish a quiz place its shortcode in a post or page

## FAQ

### I tried to use a contact form at the end of the quiz but it does not work

The final screen is loaded by Ajax so some contact and other forms which use complex JavaScript will not work. You may need to search for a different form plugin which does work when the page is loaded by Ajax. If you can’t change the plugin that you use, then provide a link at the end of the quiz to a regular post or page where the form is published.

UM is giving me so much functionality to manage several User Roles!
It is an essential aspect of the business (service marketplace).
But the best experience for me is the active, timely and kind support from the community.
Priceless!
So grateful!
