Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `festivaltts4r` Ruby gem passes user-modifiable strings directly to a shell command without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `to_speech` and `to_mp3` methods within `lib/festivaltts4r/festival4r.rb` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting shell metacharacters and commands within the strings passed to `to_speech` and `to_mp3` methods, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or system where the vulnerable `festivaltts4r` gem is being used.
- **System Compromise:** This could lead to full system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector involves manipulating strings that are passed to the vulnerable methods. This could occur if user-provided input (or data from any untrusted source) is used as input to the `to_speech` or `to_mp3` methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Influence Input:** The attacker needs to have the capability to control or influence the strings that are passed as arguments to the vulnerable `to_speech` or `to_mp3` methods.
- **No special privileges**: No special privileges are needed to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in the `festivaltts4r` gem.
* The `espeak-ruby` gem has a similar issue which is assigned CVE-2016-10193.
* A proof of concept exploit is provided, demonstrating the injection using backticks to execute arbitrary commands like `nc -lvp 1337 -e /bin/sh`
* At the time of reporting, no patch was available for `festivaltts4r`.
