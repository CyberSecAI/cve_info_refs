## Description

This plugin offers limited support. Please do not expect new features or too many bugfixes. Features may be removed at any time.

Add From Server is designed to help ease the pain of bad web hosts, allowing you to upload files via FTP or SSH and later import them into WordPress.

This plugin is NOT designed to..

\* Be used as a replacement for the file uploader

\* Be used for migration of websites

\* Re-import your files after moving webhosting

\* Batch import media

This plugins IS designed to..

\* Import files which are larger than your hosting allows to be uploaded.

\* Import files which are too large for your internet connections upload speed.

WordPress does a better job of file uploads than this plugin, so please consider your needs before you use it.

You may also want to look at using WP-CLI for media import purposes:

https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/import/

## FAQ

### How can I import files from other folders?

In 3.4, the plugin changed to limit the directories you can import files from.

If you wish to import files from other folders, you need to add the ADD\_FROM\_SERVER constant to your wp-config.php file.

For example:

define( ‘ADD\_FROM\_SERVER’, ‘/www/’ );

### Why does the file I want to import have a red background?

WordPress only allows the importing/uploading of certain file types to improve your security.

If you wish to add extra file types, you can use a plugin such as: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pjw-mime-config/ You can also enable “Unfiltered uploads” globally for WordPress if you’d like to override this security function. Please see the WordPress support forum for details.

### Where are the files saved?

If you import a file which is outside your standard upload directory (usually wp-content/uploads/) then it will be copied to your current upload directory setting as normal.

If you however import a file which **is already within the uploads directory** (for example, wp-content/uploads/2011/02/superplugin.zip) then the file will not be copied, and will be used as-is.

### I have a a bug report

You can report bugs on [GitHub](https://github.com/dd32/add-from-server) and get support in the [WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/add-from-server/).

That “outdated 11 year old plugin that over 100k people still insist on using” (description from Github) still works perfectly fine and I haven’t found a good alternative.
I would love to see a version update to make it available for installing directly from Wordpress again.

### [What an amazing Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-an-amazing-plugin-16/)

Well, first of all, that plugin is amazing.
Saved me for sure from unwanted hassle while importing/updating every day WooCommerce products.Daily about 1500-2000 products adding or updating, with average 12 images per product, and also about 6-8 technical documents per product (mostly pdf files), no importer was able to complete a single run.
Having your plugin importing the images into the media library and then matching images, just did the job. All under 10 minutes !
As i said, that’s an amazing plugin, and it works fine on a well standing server (I’m on Lite Speed Server, MariaDB, PHP 8.4)

### [Does not import Folder Structure to Media Library](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-not-import-folder-structure-to-media-library/)

[Kissington](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kissington/ "Posts by Kissington")

What’s the use of importing files from the server if you can’t import the folder structure they are in for organization? I expected the plugin to import files and auto-create a virtual folder in the library which is named after the original folder from the server. As it is, the files are imported into the media library and mixed with other files which makes it hard to locate and manage. You will need to re-organize them manually using a folder plugin like FileBird, which takes a lot of time. Not worth it. The first requirement for a plugin is automating tasks to eliminate manual work, otherwise its pointless….

This plugin is not only helpful when you need a workaround for files which are too big for your upload limit, but also if you need to restore a website after something went wrong.
The only feature I miss is a filter that allows to show only the original images (and not all the different sizes WordPress generates from each image you upload).
