      "Root cause": "The WordPress application uses the SERVER_NAME server header, which can be manipulated via the HTTP HOST header, to construct the email domain for the 'from' address in emails. This value is then passed to the vulnerable PHPMailer's setFrom() function.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of the HTTP Host header",
        "Vulnerable PHPMailer library (CVE-2016-10033)",
        "Lack of sanitization of the from email address used in wp_mail() function"

      "Impact": "Unauthenticated remote attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the target server by injecting parameters into the sendmail command.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Manipulating the HTTP HOST header to inject malicious parameters into the email 'from' address.",
        "Exploiting the vulnerability in the PHPMailer setFrom() function through the crafted email address"

      "Root cause": "The Vanilla Forums software uses the HTTP_HOST header to set the host name when sending emails, making it susceptible to Host Header Injection.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of the HTTP_HOST header",
        "Vulnerable PHPMailer library",
		"Lack of sanitization of the server name used for email addresses",
        "Use of untrusted data from headers in email sending process"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker could intercept password reset hashes or perform web-cache poisoning by manipulating the host used in password reset links and email sender address.",

        "Manipulating the HTTP HOST header to inject malicious domains into email links."

      "Root cause": "The application uses the user-supplied HTTP HOST header to form the sender email address. This user-supplied header is not properly sanitized or validated.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of the HTTP Host header.",
		"Lack of sanitization of the hostname used in the 'from' address of emails."

      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a combination of the Host header injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10073) and a PHPMailer vulnerability (CVE-2016-10033), allowing a remote code execution exploit to be built.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of the HTTP Host header.",
        "Vulnerable PHPMailer library.",
		"Lack of sanitization of the server name used for email addresses",
		"Usage of the vulnerable mail() function without proper sanitization"

   "exploitbox.io_cfb2ed37_20250126_112800.html": {
        "Root cause": "The PHP mail() function's 5th parameter allows for the injection of additional parameters into the /usr/sbin/sendmail command. The vulnerability is a result of the mail() function not properly escaping the parameters passed, allowing attackers to manipulate the behavior of the sendmail command.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation/sanitization in the mail() function parameters",
		   "Vulnerability in PHP's mail() function handling of the 5th parameter"

        "Impact": "An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) by manipulating sendmail parameters with crafted input via the mail() function.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Manipulating the 5th parameter of the mail() function with malicious arguments, targeting various MTAs (Sendmail, Exim, Postfix) to perform command injection.",

		"Required attacker capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to inject data into the 5th parameter of the PHP mail() function through a vulnerable web application to send crafted emails. The target application must also use the PHP mail function with unsanitized input."
