Everybody knows about Issuu. It’s a way to publish PDFs and distribute them over the Internet with an astonishingly good look & feel. WordPress can directly embed the Issuu flipbook, and it’s a breeze to use.
We all know that. We also know that Issuu is a paid service. When you have a 150-page catalogue taking 160 MBytes to load… forget it, you cannot afford to host it on Issuu. You have to do it by yourself.
Also, Issuu may not allow all content to be displayed. They have their own reasons for flagging content as inappropriate — in some cases, to view your content, you have to demand that your viewers sign up with Issuu, too (so they can be independently validated, of course). This makes everything much cumbersome.
There are many, many PDF viewers out there. In fact, these days, most people don’t even bother with PDF viewers, because most browsers already have the ability to directly view them — no plugin, no JavaScript, nothing else is required.
“Ah,” you’d say — since you’re reading this review… “but that’s not the same as the cute animations that Issuu allows. It’s bare-bones PDF viewing — boring! Issuu, on the contrary, brings the user the experience of flipping through a book!”
Indeed it does, but what if you have no option but to host the PDFs on your own website?
Enter Real3D Flipbook!
To be perfectly honest: I have the exact same PDF (aye, it’s 150 pages and 160+ MBytes in size) side by side, on Issue and on Real3D Flipbook. I like Real3D Flipbook more. The flipping animation is nicer and more realistic (and you can even get it to play a flipping sound), using advanced WebGL features such as shading and light rendering. And it’s not an embedded iFrame — rather, this plugin directly accesses the browser’s canvas, so it gets access to more powerful tools (or so I guess). And if you’re scared of serving 160 MBytes (or more!) from your own server, don’t worry — Real3D Flipbook will only render pages on demand, as they get requested by the person viewing the PDF. They will not need to retrieve all pages in advance (of course, that also means that if you flip through a big. heavy PDF very quickly, there will be some pages temporarily rendered as blank pages, until Real3D Flipbook ‘catches up’ with the content being served).
Oh, by the way, all the above goodies come as standard on the free version (the one you can get from here). There is a paid version, which you can get from the Envato marketplace. It’s cheap, but it allows much more detailed configuration of all aspects of Real3D Flipbook, have different settings for different PDFs, and so forth. And there is an additional option to store your PDF on their CDN as well, if you’re really concerned about the load on your server.
In other words: if you’re actually recommending to a customer a solution for showing PDFs on their website, and your customer is willing to pay for such a service, then, with Real3D Flipbook, you have basically the same service as Issuu, without their restrictions — and without Issuu’s price. And you get a much cooler flipping animation! (Note that even the free version allows more basic rendering — just using CSS, for instance — which will make your pages much lighter. But that’s your choice!)
I’m aware that this plugin, while heavily recommended, is not faultless. For instance, it’s clear that it doesn’t get updated all that often. Sometimes, this is not necessarily bad — except for security issues, if the plugin already has all the functionality you need, ‘frozen’ in place, so to speak, why bother to update it, just for the sake of saying ‘hey, a new version is out?’ As an amateur plugin developer myself, that’s the path I take as well.
The settings page for the plugin, as well as the online documentation, also suffer from bad spelling mistakes and some confusing organisation overall. It’s clear, from the Envato marketplace, that this plugin stated its life as merely a jQuery-based collection of scripts. Turning it into a plugin (supporting shortcodes and Gutenberg blocks!) required further development, and it’s possible that the ‘adaptation’ of a jQuery-only plugin to work fully integrated into WordPress had its rough edges. Still, one might argue that it could have been done differently, and that both the plugin would benefit from a text revision made by a professional technical writer.
It would also be nice if the developer just updated the information about the version of WordPress this works with. I get all those warnings saying that the plugin has never been tested with the most current version of WordPress. The truth is that it works flawlessly (it was well-designed from the start!), it’s just that the developer didn’t bother to update the version on the plugin configuration files.
Last but not least, even though this is a standalone plugin, and the same applies to the paid version as well, there are extra goodies that you can install separately, buying them directly from Envato. Some of those goodies are extremely useful, while others might not be relevant. Instead of bundling them all together, you just get the features you wish to pay for. That’s certainly a very appealing business model, and one that allows the developer to continue to add functionality to Real3D Flipbook, but with external modules, additional to the ‘core’. In fact, this is the same concept that made WordPress (and, later, WooCommerce) the most-used CMS in the world: start with a bare-bones (but fully functional!) solution first, and let users pick whatever additional functionality they want — adding these in a modular way (some of which will be paid, but the bulk will be free).
Real3D Flipbook adopts the same concept (at a much smaller scale, of course). No wonder it’s so recommended on the popular reviewing sites out there. There might be quite good plugins here and there, many of which free (or at least having an entry-level free version), but none rivals Real3D Flipbook, and most don’t even come close.
Not even Issuu.

It’s a good plugin with few small issues that need polishing, one of them being the updates. Unlike all other plugins I purchased, this one requires manually downloading an archive and copying files into relevant folders on the server. I wish this process would be automatic.

This plugin is very good, clever and fast! It has all or even more settings from those that may be needed and works great. It’s probably one of the best of WordPress.org. Well done to the developer!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [WordPress] Real 3D Flipbook Plugin Exploit

Mukarram Khalid • July 3, 2016

[wordpress](/category/wordpress "View posts in wordpress")
[exploits](/category/exploits "View posts in exploits")

## Introduction

Real 3D Flipbook is a wordpress plugin which uses Web Graphics Library to create 3D flip books. We can upload PDF files or JPEG images and it will automatically make an interactive flipbook for wordpress posts and pages. At the time of writing this post, the plugin costs $32 with $9.60 for extended 12 months support. You can find further details on the official [codecanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/real3d-flipbook-wordpress-plugin/6942587) page.

## Vulnerabilities

The company I work for, bought this plugin few days ago and decided to use it on our wordpress blog for the company featured magazine. We don't install the plugins directly on our wordpress instance. We usually audit the code and add some tweaks first. That's where I come in.

While auditing this plugin, I found some critical vulnerabilities which can be exploited by an unauthenticated user and do some real damage to our wordpress installation. Here's the list of vulnerabilities:

* Delete any file or directory from the server (Unauthenticated)
* Upload images in Root directory (Unauthenticated)
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

Let's take a look at these vulnerabilities individually.

### Delete Files or Directories (Unauthenticated)

This vulnerability exists in a file `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/process.php`. Here's a code snippet from the file.

```
if (isset($_POST["deleteBook"]) && !empty($_POST["deleteBook"])) {
    $bookName = $_POST['deleteBook'];
    $dirPath = "../../../uploads/real3dflipbook/".$bookName;

    if (! is_dir($dirPath)) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException("$dirPath must be a directory");
    }
    if (substr($dirPath, strlen($dirPath) - 1, 1) != '/') {
        $dirPath .= '/';
    }
    $files = glob($dirPath . '*', GLOB_MARK);
    foreach ($files as $file) {
        if (is_dir($file)) {
            self::deleteDir($file);
        } else {
            unlink($file);
        }
    }
    rmdir($dirPath);
}

```

This file was meant to be called within the scope of wordpress admin panel but it doesn't check for user authentication at all so, an unauthenticated user can call this file and pass POST parameters. On line 55, POST parameter `deleteBook` is assigned to a variable `$bookName` which further gets concatenated to `$dirPath`. Lines 58 – 60 make sure that the resulting path is a valid directory. On line 64, PHPs `glob()` function returns an array of filenames and directories matching the given pattern in `$dirPath`. From line 65 to 72, it loops through all the file paths and deletes them one by one. At the end of the loop, it deletes the parent directory by `rmdir($dirPath)`.

An end user can exploit this vulnerability and delete any wordpress file or directory by simply making a POST request to `process.php` with the POST data `deleteBook=../../../wp-includes/css` or `deleteBook=../../../wp-includes/customize`.

`self::deleteDir()` on line 67 may create some problem for us, as we're calling this file outside the class scope. So, we need to make sure that we never land on line 67, the best way is to delete the files in this specific order [wpFiles.json](https://mukarramkhalid.com/assets/files/wordpress-real-3d-flipbook-plugin-exploit/wpFiles.json). This order starts from the deepest directory with no other directories in it and then gradually moves to the parent directory thus always landing on `unlink()` or `rmdir()` on lines 69 and 72 respectively.

### Upload Images in Root Directory

This vulnerability also exists in file `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/process.php`. Here's the code snippet.

```
if (isset($_POST["imgbase"]) && !empty($_POST["imgbase"])) {

    // get the image data
    $data = $_POST['imgbase'];
    $bookName = $_POST['bookName'];

    list($type, $data) = explode(';', $data);
    list(, $data) = explode(',', $data);
    $data = base64_decode($data);

    $booksFolder = "../../../uploads/real3dflipbook/";
    if (!file_exists($booksFolder)) {
        mkdir($booksFolder, 0777, true);
    }

    $bookFolder = "../../../uploads/real3dflipbook/".$bookName;
    if (!file_exists($bookFolder)) {
        mkdir($bookFolder, 0777, true);
    }

    $filename = $bookFolder."/".$_POST['pageName'].".jpg";
    // $thumbName = $bookFolder."/".$_POST['pageName']."_thumb.jpg";

    $file = $filename;

    // decode the image data and save it to file
    if (!file_put_contents($file, $data)){
        echo "failed";
    } else {
        echo "success";
    }
}

```

On line 5, the POST parameter `imageBase` expects the Base64 encoded image data. Something like `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADIA...`. On line 6, POST parameter `bookName` determines the upload directory path. From line 14 to 26, it processes the image data, decodes it and creates the upload directories. It takes a POST parameter `pageName` which is used as the image filename and copies the image data to a JPG file on line 35. An end user can upload images directly in the root directory by simply making a POST request to `process.php`.

For example, this payload will upload an image `makman.jpg` in the root directory of the website `imgbase=data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAA...&bookName=../../../&pageName=makman`, and not to mention, with out any user authentication.

If the webserver is running PHP version prior to PHP 5.3, we can also leverage this vulnerability to code execution by uploading PHP files. PHP < 5.3 was vulnerable to Null Bytes injection/truncation attacks.

In that case, we can upload PHP files by changing our payload to `imgbase=data:image/png;base64,iVBOAAA..&bookName=../../../&pageName=makman.php%00`, which will result in `makman.php` created in the root directory with our input data `imgbase` as the file contents.

### Cross Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)

This vulnerability exists in `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/flipbooks.php` where unsanitized user input is directly echoed on the page. An end user can exploit this vulnerability by simply making a GET request to `flipbooks.php` with GET parameters `action=delete&bookId=<script>alert(/makman/)</script>`.

## Exploit Code

A simple search for Google dork `"wp-content/uploads/real3dflipbook"` resulted in 13K websites using Real 3D Flipbook plugin.

![Google Search](../assets/images/blog/posts/wordpress-real-3d-flipbook-plugin-exploit/flipbook3.png)

Here comes the fun part, I've coded a POC in Python which exploits all these vulnerabilities for the given website. It deletes all the important files in `wp-content/` and `wp-admin/` thus breaking the wordpress installation. Then, it uploads an image `makman.jpg` in the root directory of the website and finally checks the XSS payload. Here's the code.
