  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2016-10965",
      "root_cause": "The plugin's `process.php` file does not perform authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated users to access and execute file deletion functionalities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Unauthenticated file deletion"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files and directories on the server, potentially leading to a complete denial of service by breaking the WordPress installation.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/process.php` with the `deleteBook` parameter set to the path of the target file or directory.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication required; attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable website."

    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2016-10966",
      "root_cause": "The plugin's `process.php` file does not perform authentication checks and improperly handles file uploads, allowing unauthenticated users to upload images to arbitrary locations on the server.",
      "weaknesses": [
         "Improper access control",
          "Unauthenticated file upload",
        "Path traversal vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can upload malicious files to the web server, which could lead to further exploitation, such as code execution. If PHP version prior to 5.3 is used, an attacker can inject null byte characters to upload PHP files to gain code execution.",
      "attack_vectors":"Sending a crafted POST request to `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/process.php` with parameters `imgbase`, `bookName`, and `pageName`, allowing the attacker to specify the file content, location, and name.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication required; attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable website."
    },
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2016-10967",
      "root_cause": "The plugin's `flipbooks.php` file does not sanitize user input, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Reflected XSS"
      ],
       "impact":"An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable page, which can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted GET request to `wp-content/plugins/real3d-flipbook/includes/flipbooks.php` with the `bookId` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication required; attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable website, and the victim must access the crafted URL."
