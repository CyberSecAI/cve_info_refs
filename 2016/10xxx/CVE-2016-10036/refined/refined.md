Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-10036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the file upload API within JFrog Artifactory versions prior to 4.16. Specifically, the "filename" parameter is not sanitized, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if "Allow Anonymous Access" is enabled (which is the default setting).
- **Directory Traversal:** The "filename" parameter in the file upload API is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Creation:** Attackers can overwrite existing files or create new files in the application folder. This can include HTML, JavaScript, or other files used by the application.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory, an attacker can deploy a servlet and execute arbitrary code on the server. This is possible because the application does not adequately restrict the destination of the uploaded file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/artifactory/ui/artifact/upload` endpoint.
- The attacker must manipulate the `filename` parameter in the `Content-Disposition` header to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Artifactory instance.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated if anonymous access is enabled (which is default), and hence, can be an external user.
- The attacker needs to know the internal path of the tomcat web application to perform the remote code execution (i.e. `/tomcat/webapps/`)

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit-db content includes example HTTP POST requests demonstrating both scenarios:
    - Overwriting app.html file by traversing directory structure to inject malicious javascript.
    - Uploading a malicious WAR file to achieve remote command execution.
- The content specifies that the default Tomcat configuration within Artifactory will not execute JSP files directly in the application folder, limiting the direct file overwrite vulnerability. But, the remote code execution can be performed by uploading a malicious web archive.
