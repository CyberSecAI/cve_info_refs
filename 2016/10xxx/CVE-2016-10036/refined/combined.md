# Into the Sunset on May 1st: Bintray, GoCenter, and ChartCenter

**UPDATE 7/2/2024:** After over three years of maintaining JCenter as a read-only repository for legacy Java packages, JFrog is moving forward with an official sunset of JCenter, and, in coordination with Maven Central, will begin automatically redirecting all JCenter requests to the Maven Central Repository. The first of several service brown-outs is scheduled for **July 30th** and will periodically continue until the **final shutdown** of JCenter on **August 15th**. For more details, please see [JFrog’s official announcement](https://jfrog.com/blog/jcenter-sunset/).

**UPDATE 4/27/2021:**We listened to the community and will keep JCenter as a read-only repository indefinitely. Our customers and the community can continue to rely on JCenter as a reliable mirror for Java packages.

**UPDATE 2/28/2021:** To better support the community in this migration, JFrog has extended the JCenter **new package versions submission** deadline through **March 31st 2021**.

JFrog is making some important changes that will impact users of Bintray, JCenter (part of Bintray), GoCenter, and ChartCenter.

Bintray has provided the open source community a free, universal cloud platform for publishing and distributing binaries. Bintray helped JFrog support the Java community as the host of the JCenter repository for Java OSS libraries, packages and components. We launched GoCenter and ChartCenter to extend similar services to the Go and cloud-native communities.

JFrog is evolving to meet the new challenges that developers face. Many of the services that Bintray provides are now served by the JFrog Platform for the open source community. Similarly, the Go and Helm communities have since created central repositories of their own that are drop-in replacements for our centers.

To streamline the productivity of the JFrog Platform we will be sunsetting Bintray, GoCenter, and ChartCenter services on May 1st, 2021. Users of these services will need to migrate to the respective canonical repository, and we will continue to offer both [trial and paid JFrog Platform cloud subscriptions](https://jfrog.com/pricing/#sass) that can serve other binary distribution needs. Additionally, JFrog is partnering with hubs like [Docker](https://jfrog.com/blog/jfrog-docker-partnership-for-dockerhub/) to help ensure that infrastructure our customers and community depend upon is well maintained.

ConanCenter, which we [announced](https://blog.conan.io/2020/01/13/New-Conan-Center-Improves-Search-Discovery.html) last January, will be going forward with additional investment to make it an even better resource for C and C++ developers relying on [Conan packages](https://jfrog.com/integration/conan-package-manager/). Expect continuous improvement in the developer experience for ConanCenter over the years to come.

The changes are coming in these phases:

| **When** | **What’s Changing** |
| --- | --- |
| Now | Bintray, JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter service continues. Bintray/JCenter users should start migrating to a new hosting solution. |
| February 28th, 2021 | No more submissions will be accepted to GoCenter, and ChartCenter The GoCenter and ChartCenter websites will be disabled (client requests will still work). |
| March 31st, 2021 | No more submissions will be accepted to JCenter. |
| April 12th, 26th, 2021 | We will have some short service brown-outs to remind users about the services that are going away on May 1st. (Specific hours will be advertised in the Bintray status page.) |
| May 1st, 2021 | Bintray services will no longer be available. GoCenter, and ChartCenter services will no longer be available to non-Artifactory clients. (ConanCenter and JCenter are not affected). |

Here are some answers to questions you’re likely to have:

**What happens after the sunset of Bintray?**

On May 1, 2021, the sunset will impact all existing Bintray users. Bintray users will be blocked and will no longer be able to use the Bintray service. This includes existing software distribution, account administrative access, UI access, and the REST API.

**What is the community alternative for GoCenter and ChartCenter?**

The Go team has built a module repository for Go developers called [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/) that can be used as a direct replacement for GoCenter. Similarly the Helm community has built a chart and package library called [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/) that can be used as a replacement for ChartCenter.

**I’m a Bintray Enterprise or Bintray Pro customer. What help should I expect?**

Bintray Enterprise and other select customers are being contacted by their JFrog account reps to help ensure their migration goes smoothly. They will provide sufficient support to confirm that you have successfully obtained all of your Bintray data, and validate that the content is no longer being downloaded before account disablement and data deletion.

**What happens to my data after Bintray is sunset?**

All of the data on Bintray is available for download through May 1st and we encourage you to transfer it out. JFrog will begin deleting data several weeks after the official sunset date and will not retain any Bintray data after that.

**I have Artifactory remote repositories configured to use JCenter, GoCenter, or ChartCenter. Will this break them?**

Artifactory installations with remote repositories configured against JCenter, GoCenter, and ChartCenter will **not** be affected by this sunset.

We recommend that JFrog Cloud customers continue using jcenter.bintray.com, gocenter.io, and repo.chartcenter.io as Artifactory remote repositories going forward.

JFrog self-hosted customers can also continue fetching from these repositories, but are encouraged to migrate to the canonical repositories.

**I have other questions about subscribing to the JFrog Platform. Who can I contact?**

If you need more answers, please feel free to contact us on Twitter [@JFrog](http://twitter.com/jfrog).

# Exploit Title: Jfrog Artifactory < 4.16 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload / Remote Command Execution
# Date: 2018-04-25
# Exploit Author: Alessio Sergi
# Vendor Homepage: https://jfrog.com/artifactory/
# Software Link: https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory/download_file?file_path=jfrog-artifactory-oss-4.15.0.zip
# CVE : CVE-2016-10036

Jfrog Artifactory < 4.16 is vulnerable to unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and directory traversal vulnerabilities.
The vulnerabilities are within the upload api "/artifactory/ui/artifact/upload", require that "Allow Anonymous Access" is enabled (as it is on a default installation) and can be abused to create or overwrite files on the server. Specifically, it is possible to create or overwrite any files inside the application folder (scenario 1) or deploy a new application (scenario 2) and execute arbitrary code on the server.

Scenario 1: It is possible to modify the html files of the application just by executing an http post request like the one below, which exploits a directory traversal vulnerability on the parameter "filename" to insert the javascript code "<SCRIPT>alert(/Vulnerable/)</SCRIPT>" within the file app.html :

******

</html>

-----------------------------6085305491255810029929874687--

******

(It is also possible to exploit this vulnerability to create JSP files within the application folder, but the tomcat used by Artifactory on a default installation won't execute them.)

Scenario 2:

It is possible to exploit the same vulnerability to deploy a malicious servlet application on the tomcat server and obtain remote code execution:

******

POST /artifactory/ui/artifact/upload HTTP/1.1
Host: [removed]
User-Agent: [removed]

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Martin Eggenberger
Chief Architect, Monster

“As a long-time DevOps engineer, I know how difficult it can be to keep track of the myriad of package types – legacy and new – that corporations have in their inventory. JFrog has always done a phenomenal job at keeping our team supported, efficient and operational – because if JFrog goes out, we might as well go home. Thankfully, with AWS infrastructure at our backs as well, we know we can develop and deliver with confidence anywhere our business demands today, and in the future.”
