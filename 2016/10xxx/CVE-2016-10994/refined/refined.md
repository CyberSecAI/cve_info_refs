- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `s` parameter of the GET request in the Truemag theme for WordPress. The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in this parameter, allowing injection of malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Client-side XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/encoding in the `s` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent external redirects, non-persistent loading of malicious scripts, or non-persistent manipulation of the web module context.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject malicious script code via the `s` parameter in a GET request. The attack is non-persistent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no privileged user account, and exploitation only requires low user interaction (e.g., clicking a crafted link).
