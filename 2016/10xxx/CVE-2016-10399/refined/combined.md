 **SilverListing Spoof Protection**

* SilverListing has been extended to provide spoof detection through this new feature. By enabling SilverListing Spoof Protection if an email is received from a sender associated with an “Allow Contact” record but from a new IP address, SilverListing will be applied. Since all valid email messages from Allow Contacts come from a very small list of IP addresses the vast majority of email will be delivered immediately. For those email messages that come from an IP which has not previously passed the SilverListing test then SilverListing will be applied to confirm the message is not from a spammer.
* Enabled by default.

**Sender IP Address Bad Reputation**

* The Commtouch IP Reputation feature will allow Sendio administrators to define how Sendio should handle messages from sources with an IP reputation that indicates a 90% or higher likelihood of sending spam. Our testing has shown the 90% value is the ideal value for stopping known spammers without increasing the chance of false positives. As such this value is not configurable.
* If the Commtouch service or our Premium AV service was not purchased then the Sendio IP Address Bad Reputation feature will be grayed out and unavailable.
* Enabled by default – Action set to Hold Message.

**When No Contact Matches**

* Very basic question – how should Sendio respond when there is neither a Contact nor an Administrator Policy that applies to a message? Previously this logic was tied directly with Sender Address Verification. This new feature allows you to configure the 2 elements (Contact Checking and SAV) separately. For example now messages can be Held without generating an SAV.
* Default action set to Hold Message.

**No Contact Match for Bulk Messages**

* Sendio has always included Bulk classifications within the user interface (to get a sense for what Bulk is you can change the message view in your Sendio web interface to Pending messages, show bulk), but with the release of Sendio 6 administrators will now be able to configure how Sendio should respond when there is neither a Contact nor an Administrator Policy that applies to a Bulk message.
* Default action set to Hold Message.

**Sender Address Verification (SAV)**

* This is the same as the existing option but only applies to non-Bulk messages. Sender Address Verification will be sent to new senders.
* Enabled by default.

**Send SAV for Bulk Messages**

* For messages tagged as Bulk will Sendio generate an SAV? Research indicates that extremely few SAV generated for Bulk messages are ever replied to.
* Disabled by default.

**Send SAV Acknowledgements**

* Based on customer feedback we now allow you to configure whether Sendio will send the SAV Acknowledgement to senders that reply to the SAV.
* Enabled by default.

**24h System Sender Response Limit**

* This option defines the maximum number of automatic responses (SAV, NDR, DSN) generated by a Sendio system to a particular email address in a 24 hour period.
* Value set to 50 by default.

**24h Per User Sender Response Limit**

* This option defines the maximum number of automatic responses (SAV, NDR, DSN) from a given Sendio user to a particular email address in a 24 hour period.
* Value set to 1 by default.

**Manual Time Synchronization**

* From the SSH (PuTTY) interface > System Control section there is now a Sync Time option. Selecting this option will force Sendio to immediately synchronize the internal time with an NTP server
