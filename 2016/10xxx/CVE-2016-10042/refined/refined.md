- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authorization bypass vulnerability exists in the router management web interface of Arcadyan Swisscom routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to reconfigure the routing table, specifically accessing, adding, or modifying static routes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary internal or external IPs as the next hop for routing, potentially leading to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the web interface of the affected routers, specifically the component that manages the routing table. The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated users, meaning a user does not need to have a username and password to access the vulnerable functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the router's web interface, and does not need to be authenticated.
