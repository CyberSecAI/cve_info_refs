  "CVE-2016-10048": {
    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in magick/module.c in ImageMagick 6.9.4-7 allows remote attackers to load arbitrary modules via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by not properly escaping relative paths when loading modules.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary module loading, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The attacker can cause a denial of service or have other unspecified impact.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because relative paths like `../` were not checked/escaped when loading modules, allowing an attacker to potentially load a module from outside the intended directory, bypassing security restrictions."
