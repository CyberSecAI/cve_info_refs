x86/kbuild: enable modversions for symbols exported from asm
commit 334bb773876403eae3457d81be0b8ea70f8e4ccc upstream.
Commit 4efca4ed ("kbuild: modversions for EXPORT\_SYMBOL() for asm") adds
modversion support for symbols exported from asm files. Architectures
must include C-style declarations for those symbols in asm/asm-prototypes.h
in order for them to be versioned.
Add these declarations for x86, and an architecture-independent file that
can be used for common symbols.
With f27c2f6 reverting 8ab2ae6 ("default exported asm symbols to zero") we
produce a scary warning on x86, this commit fixes that.

builddeb: fix cross-building to arm64 producing host-arch debs
commit 152b695d74376bfe55cd2a6265ccc75b0d39dd19 upstream.
Both Debian and kernel archs are "arm64" but UTS\_MACHINE and gcc say
"aarch64". Recognizing just the latter should be enough but let's
accept both in case something regresses again or an user sets
UTS\_MACHINE=arm64.
Regressed in cfa88c7: arm64: Set UTS\_MACHINE in the Makefile.

xfs: fix up xfs\_swap\_extent\_forks inline extent handling
commit 4dfce57db6354603641132fac3c887614e3ebe81 upstream.
There have been several reports over the years of NULL pointer
dereferences in xfs\_trans\_log\_inode during xfs\_fsr processes,
when the process is doing an fput and tearing down extents
on the temporary inode, something like:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000018

As it turns out, this is because the i\_itemp pointer, along
with the d\_ops pointer, has been overwritten with zeros
when we tear down the extents during truncate. When the in-core
inode fork on the temporary inode used by xfs\_fsr was originally
set up during the extent swap, we mistakenly looked at di\_nextents
to determine whether all extents fit inline, but this misses extents
generated by speculative preallocation; we should be using if\_bytes
instead.
This mistake corrupts the in-memory inode, and code in
xfs\_iext\_remove\_inline eventually gets bad inputs, causing
it to memmove and memset incorrect ranges; this became apparent
because the two values in ifp->if\_u2.if\_inline\_ext[1] contained
what should have been in d\_ops and i\_itemp; they were memmoved due
to incorrect array indexing and then the original locations
were zeroed with memset, again due to an array overrun.
Fix this by properly using i\_df.if\_bytes to determine the number
of extents, not di\_nextents.
Thanks to dchinner for looking at this with me and spotting the
root cause.

arm/xen: Use alloc\_percpu rather than \_\_alloc\_percpu
commit 24d5373dda7c00a438d26016bce140299fae675e upstream.
The function xen\_guest\_init is using \_\_alloc\_percpu with an alignment
which are not power of two.
However, the percpu allocator never supported alignments which are not power
of two and has always behaved incorectly in thise case.
Commit 3ca45a4 "percpu: ensure requested alignment is power of two"
introduced a check which trigger a warning [1] when booting linux-next
on Xen. But in reality this bug was always present.
This can be fixed by replacing the call to \_\_alloc\_percpu with
alloc\_percpu. The latter will use an alignment which are a power of two.

xen/gntdev: Use VM\_MIXEDMAP instead of VM\_IO to avoid NUMA balancing

Commit 9c17d96500f7 ("xen/gntdev: Grant maps should not be subject to
NUMA balancing") set VM\_IO flag to prevent grant maps from being
subjected to NUMA balancing.
It was discovered recently that this flag causes get\_user\_pages() to
always fail with -EFAULT.

(which can happen if guest's vdisk has direct-io-safe option).
To avoid this let's use VM\_MIXEDMAP flag instead --- it prevents
NUMA balancing just as VM\_IO does and has no effect on
check\_vma\_flags().

kernel/debug/debug\_core.c: more properly delay for secondary CPUs
commit 2d13bb6494c807bcf3f78af0e96c0b8615a94385 upstream.
We've got a delay loop waiting for secondary CPUs. That loop uses
loops\_per\_jiffy. However, loops\_per\_jiffy doesn't actually mean how
many tight loops make up a jiffy on all architectures. It is quite
common to see things like this in the boot log:
Calibrating delay loop (skipped), value calculated using timer
frequency.. 48.00 BogoMIPS (lpj=24000)
In my case I was seeing lots of cases where other CPUs timed out
entering the debugger only to print their stack crawls shortly after the
kdb> prompt was written.
Elsewhere in kgdb we already use udelay(), so that should be safe enough
to use to implement our timeout. We'll delay 1 ms for 1000 times, which
should give us a full second of delay (just like the old code wanted)
but allow us to notice that we're done every 1 ms.

commit 9eff1140a82db8c5520f76e51c21827b4af670b3 upstream.
Systemd on reboot enables shutdown watchdog that leaves the watchdog
device open to ensure that even if power down process get stuck the
platform reboots nonetheless.
The iamt\_wdt is an alarm-only watchdog and can't reboot system, but the
FW will generate an alarm event reboot was completed in time, as the
watchdog is not automatically disabled during power cycle.
So we should request stop watchdog on reboot to eliminate wrong alarm
from the FW.

kernel/watchdog: use nmi registers snapshot in hardlockup handler
commit 4d1f0fb096aedea7bb5489af93498a82e467c480 upstream.
NMI handler doesn't call set\_irq\_regs(), it's set only by normal IRQ.
Thus get\_irq\_regs() returns NULL or stale registers snapshot with IP/SP
pointing to the code interrupted by IRQ which was interrupted by NMI.
NULL isn't a problem: in this case watchdog calls dump\_stack() and
prints full stack trace including NMI. But if we're stuck in IRQ
handler then NMI watchlog will print stack trace without IRQ part at
all.
This patch uses registers snapshot passed into NMI handler as arguments:
these registers point exactly to the instruction interrupted by NMI.

CIFS: Fix a possible double locking of mutex during reconnect
commit 96a988ffeb90dba33a71c3826086fe67c897a183 upstream.
With the current code it is possible to lock a mutex twice when
a subsequent reconnects are triggered. On the 1st reconnect we
reconnect sessions and tcons and then persistent file handles.
If the 2nd reconnect happens during the reconnecting of persistent
file handles then the following sequence of calls is observed:
cifs\_reopen\_file -> SMB2\_open -> small\_smb2\_init -> smb2\_reconnect
-> cifs\_reopen\_persistent\_file\_handles -> cifs\_reopen\_file (again!).
So, we are trying to acquire the same cfile->fh\_mutex twice which
is wrong. Fix this by moving reconnecting of persistent handles to
the delayed work (smb2\_reconnect\_server) and submitting this work
every time we reconnect tcon in SMB2 commands handling codepath.
This can also lead to corruption of a temporary file list in
cifs\_reopen\_persistent\_file\_handles() because we can recursively
call this function twice.

We can not unlock/lock cifs\_tcp\_ses\_lock while walking through ses

a tcon structure can be released if we don't hold an extra reference.

dm space map metadata: fix 'struct sm\_metadata' leak on failed create
commit 314c25c56c1ee5026cf99c570bdfe01847927acb upstream.
In dm\_sm\_metadata\_create() we temporarily change the dm\_space\_map
operations from 'ops' (whose .destroy function deallocates the
sm\_metadata) to 'bootstrap\_ops' (whose .destroy function doesn't).
If dm\_sm\_metadata\_create() fails in sm\_ll\_new\_metadata() or
sm\_ll\_extend(), it exits back to dm\_tm\_create\_internal(), which calls
dm\_sm\_destroy() with the intention of freeing the sm\_metadata, but it
doesn't (because the dm\_space\_map operations is still set to
'bootstrap\_ops').
Fix this by setting the dm\_space\_map operations back to 'ops' if
dm\_sm\_metadata\_create() fails when it is set to 'bootstrap\_ops'.

PM / OPP: Pass opp\_table to dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_regulator()
commit 91291d9ad92faa65a56a9a19d658d8049b78d3d4 upstream.
Joonyoung Shim reported an interesting problem on his ARM octa-core
Odoroid-XU3 platform. During system suspend, dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_regulator()
was failing for a struct device for which dev\_pm\_opp\_set\_regulator() is
called earlier.
This happened because an earlier call to
dev\_pm\_opp\_of\_cpumask\_remove\_table() function (from cpufreq-dt.c file)
removed all the entries from opp\_table->dev\_list apart from the last CPU
device in the cpumask of CPUs sharing the OPP.
But both dev\_pm\_opp\_set\_regulator() and dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_regulator()
routines get CPU device for the first CPU in the cpumask. And so the OPP
core failed to find the OPP table for the struct device.
This patch attempts to fix this problem by returning a pointer to the
opp\_table from dev\_pm\_opp\_set\_regulator() and using that as the
parameter to dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_regulator(). This ensures that the
dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_regulator() doesn't fail to find the opp table.
Note that similar design problem also exists with other
dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_\*() APIs, but those aren't used currently by anyone and
so we don't need to update them for now.

If we're dealing with HighSpeed, then it's part of

taken into consideration before.
While at that, also make sure the ep->mult defaults
to one so drivers can use it unconditionally and

mm, page\_alloc: keep pcp count and list contents in sync if struct page is corrupted
commit a6de734bc002fe2027ccc074fbbd87d72957b7a4 upstream.
Vlastimil Babka pointed out that commit 479f854a207c ("mm, page\_alloc:
defer debugging checks of pages allocated from the PCP") will allow the
per-cpu list counter to be out of sync with the per-cpu list contents if
a struct page is corrupted.
The consequence is an infinite loop if the per-cpu lists get fully
drained by free\_pcppages\_bulk because all the lists are empty but the
count is positive. The infinite loop occurs here
do {
batch\_free++;
if (++migratetype == MIGRATE\_PCPTYPES)
migratetype = 0;
list = &pcp->lists[migratetype];
} while (list\_empty(list));
What the user sees is a bad page warning followed by a soft lockup with
interrupts disabled in free\_pcppages\_bulk().
This patch keeps the accounting in sync.

mm/vmscan.c: set correct defer count for shrinker
commit 5f33a0803bbd781de916f5c7448cbbbbc763d911 upstream.
Our system uses significantly more slab memory with memcg enabled with
the latest kernel. With 3.10 kernel, slab uses 2G memory, while with
4.6 kernel, 6G memory is used. The shrinker has problem. Let's see we
have two memcg for one shrinker. In do\_shrink\_slab:
1. Check cg1. nr\_deferred = 0, assume total\_scan = 700. batch size
is 1024, then no memory is freed. nr\_deferred = 700
2. Check cg2. nr\_deferred = 700. Assume freeable = 20, then
total\_scan = 10 or 40. Let's assume it's 10. No memory is freed.
nr\_deferred = 10.
The deferred share of cg1 is lost in this case. kswapd will free no
memory even run above steps again and again.
The fix makes sure one memcg's deferred share isn't lost.

nvmet: Fix possible infinite loop triggered on hot namespace removal
commit e4fcf07cca6a3b6c4be00df16f08be894325eaa3 upstream.
When removing a namespace we delete it from the subsystem namespaces
list with list\_del\_init which allows us to know if it is enabled or
not.
The problem is that list\_del\_init initialize the list next and does
not respect the RCU list-traversal we do on the IO path for locating
a namespace. Instead we need to use list\_del\_rcu which is allowed to
run concurrently with the \_rcu list-traversal primitives (keeps list
next intact) and guarantees concurrent nvmet\_find\_naespace forward
progress.
By changing that, we cannot rely on ns->dev\_link for knowing if the
namspace is enabled, so add enabled indicator entry to nvmet\_ns for
that.

ext4: do not perform data journaling when data is encrypted
commit 73b92a2a5e97d17cc4d5c4fe9d724d3273fb6fd2 upstream.
Currently data journalling is incompatible with encryption: enabling both
at the same time has never been supported by design, and would result in
unpredictable behavior. However, users are not precluded from turning on
both features simultaneously. This change programmatically replaces data
journaling for encrypted regular files with ordered data journaling mode.
Background:
Journaling encrypted data has not been supported because it operates on
buffer heads of the page in the page cache. Namely, when the commit
happens, which could be up to five seconds after caching, the commit
thread uses the buffer heads attached to the page to copy the contents of
the page to the journal. With encryption, it would have been required to
keep the bounce buffer with ciphertext for up to the aforementioned five
seconds, since the page cache can only hold plaintext and could not be
used for journaling. Alternatively, it would be required to setup the
journal to initiate a callback at the commit time to perform deferred
encryption - in this case, not only would the data have to be written
twice, but it would also have to be encrypted twice. This level of
complexity was not justified for a mode that in practice is very rarely
used because of the overhead from the data journalling.
Solution:
If data=journaled has been set as a mount option for a filesystem, or if
journaling is enabled on a regular file, do not perform journaling if the
file is also encrypted, instead fall back to the data=ordered mode for the
file.
Rationale:
The intent is to allow seamless and proper filesystem operation when
journaling and encryption have both been enabled, and have these two
conflicting features gracefully resolved by the filesystem.

ext4: fix in-superblock mount options processing
commit 5aee0f8a3f42c94c5012f1673420aee96315925a upstream.
Fix a large number of problems with how we handle mount options in the
superblock. For one, if the string in the superblock is long enough
that it is not null terminated, we could run off the end of the string
and try to interpret superblocks fields as characters. It's unlikely
this will cause a security problem, but it could result in an invalid
parse. Also, parse\_options is destructive to the string, so in some
cases if there is a comma-separated string, it would be modified in
the superblock. (Fortunately it only happens on file systems with a
1k block size.)

crypto: caam - fix AEAD givenc descriptors
commit d128af17876d79b87edf048303f98b35f6a53dbc upstream.
The AEAD givenc descriptor relies on moving the IV through the
output FIFO and then back to the CTX2 for authentication. The
SEQ FIFO STORE could be scheduled before the data can be
read from OFIFO, especially since the SEQ FIFO LOAD needs
to wait for the SEQ FIFO LOAD SKIP to finish first. The
SKIP takes more time when the input is SG than when it's
a contiguous buffer. If the SEQ FIFO LOAD is not scheduled
before the STORE, the DECO will hang waiting for data
to be available in the OFIFO so it can be transferred to C2.
In order to overcome this, first force transfer of IV to C2
by starting the "cryptlen" transfer first and then starting to
store data from OFIFO to the output buffer.

ptrace: Don't allow accessing an undumpable mm
commit 84d77d3f06e7e8dea057d10e8ec77ad71f721be3 upstream.
It is the reasonable expectation that if an executable file is not
readable there will be no way for a user without special privileges to
read the file. This is enforced in ptrace\_attach but if ptrace
is already attached before exec there is no enforcement for read-only
executables.
As the only way to read such an mm is through access\_process\_vm
spin a variant called ptrace\_access\_vm that will fail if the
target process is not being ptraced by the current process, or
the current process did not have sufficient privileges when ptracing
began to read the target processes mm.
In the ptrace implementations replace access\_process\_vm by
ptrace\_access\_vm. There remain several ptrace sites that still use
access\_process\_vm as they are reading the target executables
instructions (for kernel consumption) or register stacks. As such it
does not appear necessary to add a permission check to those calls.
This bug has always existed in Linux.

ptrace: Capture the ptracer's creds not PT\_PTRACE\_CAP
commit 64b875f7ac8a5d60a4e191479299e931ee949b67 upstream.
When the flag PT\_PTRACE\_CAP was added the PTRACE\_TRACEME path was
overlooked. This can result in incorrect behavior when an application
like strace traces an exec of a setuid executable.
Further PT\_PTRACE\_CAP does not have enough information for making good
security decisions as it does not report which user namespace the
capability is in. This has already allowed one mistake through
insufficient granulariy.
I found this issue when I was testing another corner case of exec and
discovered that I could not get strace to set PT\_PTRACE\_CAP even when
running strace as root with a full set of caps.
This change fixes the above issue with strace allowing stracing as
root a setuid executable without disabling setuid. More fundamentaly
this change allows what is allowable at all times, by using the correct
information in it's decision.

mm: Add a user\_ns owner to mm\_struct and fix ptrace permission checks
commit bfedb589252c01fa505ac9f6f2a3d5d68d707ef4 upstream.
During exec dumpable is cleared if the file that is being executed is
not readable by the user executing the file. A bug in
ptrace\_may\_access allows reading the file if the executable happens to
enter into a subordinate user namespace (aka clone(CLONE\_NEWUSER),
unshare(CLONE\_NEWUSER), or setns(fd, CLONE\_NEWUSER).
This problem is fixed with only necessary userspace breakage by adding
a user namespace owner to mm\_struct, captured at the time of exec, so
it is clear in which user namespace CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE must be present in
to be able to safely give read permission to the executable.
The function ptrace\_may\_access is modified to verify that the ptracer
has CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN in task->mm->user\_ns instead of task->cred->user\_ns.
This ensures that if the task changes it's cred into a subordinate
user namespace it does not become ptraceable.
The function ptrace\_attach is modified to only set PT\_PTRACE\_CAP when
CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE is held over task->mm->user\_ns. The intent of
PT\_PTRACE\_CAP is to be a flag to note that whatever permission changes
the task might go through the tracer has sufficient permissions for
it not to be an issue. task->cred->user\_ns is always the same
as or descendent of mm->user\_ns. Which guarantees that having
CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE over mm->user\_ns is the worst case for the tasks
credentials.
To prevent regressions mm->dumpable and mm->user\_ns are not considered
when a task has no mm. As simply failing ptrace\_may\_attach causes
regressions in privileged applications attempting to read things
such as /proc//stat

block\_dev: don't test bdev->bd\_contains when it is not stable
commit bcc7f5b4bee8e327689a4d994022765855c807ff upstream.
bdev->bd\_contains is not stable before calling \_\_blkdev\_get().
When \_\_blkdev\_get() is called on a parition with ->bd\_openers == 0
it sets
bdev->bd\_contains = bdev;
which is not correct for a partition.
After a call to \_\_blkdev\_get() succeeds, ->bd\_openers will be > 0
and then ->bd\_contains is stable.
When FMODE\_EXCL is used, blkdev\_get() calls
bd\_start\_claiming() -> bd\_prepare\_to\_claim() -> bd\_may\_claim()
This call happens before \_\_blkdev\_get() is called, so ->bd\_contains
is not stable. So bd\_may\_claim() cannot safely use ->bd\_contains.
It currently tries to use it, and this can lead to a BUG\_ON().
This happens when a whole device is already open with a bd\_holder (in
use by dm in my particular example) and two threads race to open a
partition of that device for the first time, one opening with O\_EXCL and
one without.
The thread that doesn't use O\_EXCL gets through blkdev\_get() to
\_\_blkdev\_get(), gains the ->bd\_mutex, and sets bdev->bd\_contains = bdev;
Immediately thereafter the other thread, using FMODE\_EXCL, calls
bd\_start\_claiming() from blkdev\_get(). This should fail because the
whole device has a holder, but because bdev->bd\_contains == bdev
bd\_may\_claim() incorrectly reports success.
This thread continues and blocks on bd\_mutex.
The first thread then sets bdev->bd\_contains correctly and drops the mutex.
The thread using FMODE\_EXCL then continues and when it calls bd\_may\_claim()
again in:
BUG\_ON(!bd\_may\_claim(bdev, whole, holder));
The BUG\_ON fires.
Fix this by removing the dependency on ->bd\_contains in
bd\_may\_claim(). As bd\_may\_claim() has direct access to the whole
device, it can simply test if the target bdev is the whole device.

fs: exec: apply CLOEXEC before changing dumpable task flags
commit 613cc2b6f272c1a8ad33aefa21cad77af23139f7 upstream.
If you have a process that has set itself to be non-dumpable, and it
then undergoes exec(2), any CLOEXEC file descriptors it has open are
"exposed" during a race window between the dumpable flags of the process
being reset for exec(2) and CLOEXEC being applied to the file
descriptors. This can be exploited by a process by attempting to access
/proc//fd/... during this window, without requiring CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE.
The race in question is after set\_dumpable has been (for get\_link,
though the trace is basically the same for readlink):
[vfs]
-> proc\_pid\_link\_inode\_operations.get\_link
-> proc\_pid\_get\_link
-> proc\_fd\_access\_allowed
-> ptrace\_may\_access(task, PTRACE\_MODE\_READ\_FSCREDS);
Which will return 0, during the race window and CLOEXEC file descriptors
will still be open during this window because do\_close\_on\_exec has not
been called yet. As a result, the ordering of these calls should be
reversed to avoid this race window.
This is of particular concern to container runtimes, where joining a
PID namespace with file descriptors referring to the host filesystem
can result in security issues (since PRCTL\_SET\_DUMPABLE doesn't protect
against access of CLOEXEC file descriptors -- file descriptors which may
reference filesystem objects the container shouldn't have access to).

the executable is a member of the user namespace, and as such
if having CAP\_SYS\_PTRACE in the user namespace should allow
tracing the executable. If not update mm->user\_ns to

clk: ti: omap36xx: Work around sprz319 advisory 2.1
commit 035cd485a47dda64f25ccf8a90b11a07d0b7aa7a upstream.
The OMAP36xx DPLL5, driving EHCI USB, can be subject to a long-term
frequency drift. The frequency drift magnitude depends on the VCO update
rate, which is inversely proportional to the PLL divider. The kernel
DPLL configuration code results in a high value for the divider, leading
to a long term drift high enough to cause USB transmission errors. In
the worst case the USB PHY's ULPI interface can stop responding,
breaking USB operation completely. This manifests itself on the
Beagleboard xM by the LAN9514 reporting 'Cannot enable port 2. Maybe the
cable is bad?' in the kernel log.
Errata sprz319 advisory 2.1 documents PLL values that minimize the
drift. Use them automatically when DPLL5 is used for USB operation,
which we detect based on the requested clock rate. The clock framework
will still compute the PLL parameters and resulting rate as usual, but
the PLL M and N values will then be overridden. This can result in the
effective clock rate being slightly different than the rate cached by
the clock framework, but won't cause any adverse effect to USB
operation.

commit b5337cfe067e96b8a98699da90c7dcd2bec21133 upstream.
I'm using an Alienware 15 R2 and had to use the alienware quirks to
get my headphone output working.
I fixed it by adding, SND\_PCI\_QUIRK(0x1028, 0x0708, "Alienware 15 R2
2016", QUIRK\_ALIENWARE) to the patch.

ALSA: hiface: Fix M2Tech hiFace driver sampling rate change
commit 995c6a7fd9b9212abdf01160f6ce3193176be503 upstream.
Sampling rate changes after first set one are not reflected to the
hardware, while driver and ALSA think the rate has been changed.
Fix the problem by properly stopping the interface at the beginning of
prepare call, allowing new rate to be set to the hardware. This keeps
the hardware in sync with the driver.

ep\_list inside gadget structure doesn't contain ep0.
It is stored separately in ep0 field.
This causes an urb hang if gadget driver decides to

commit ccdb6be9ec6580ef69f68949ebe26e0fb58a6fb0 upstream.
The UHCI controllers in Intel chipsets rely on a platform-specific non-PME
mechanism for wakeup signalling. They can generate wakeup signals even
though they don't support PME.
We need to let the USB core know this so that it will enable runtime
suspend for UHCI controllers.

usb: gadget: composite: correctly initialize ep->maxpacket
commit e8f29bb719b47a234f33b0af62974d7a9521a52c upstream.
usb\_endpoint\_maxp() returns wMaxPacketSize in its
raw form. Without taking into consideration that it
also contains other bits reserved for isochronous
endpoints.
This patch fixes one occasion where this is a
problem by making sure that we initialize
ep->maxpacket only with lower 10 bits of the value
returned by usb\_endpoint\_maxp(). Note that seperate
patches will be necessary to audit all call sites of
usb\_endpoint\_maxp() and make sure that
usb\_endpoint\_maxp() only returns lower 10 bits of
wMaxPacketSize.

Calling brightness\_set manually isn't safe as some LED drivers don't

which will fallback to the brightness\_set\_blocking callback if needed.

usb: hub: Fix auto-remount of safely removed or ejected USB-3 devices
commit 37be66767e3cae4fd16e064d8bb7f9f72bf5c045 upstream.
USB-3 does not have any link state that will avoid negotiating a connection
with a plugged-in cable but will signal the host when the cable is
unplugged.
For USB-3 we used to first set the link to Disabled, then to RxDdetect to
be able to detect cable connects or disconnects. But in RxDetect the
connected device is detected again and eventually enabled.
Instead set the link into U3 and disable remote wakeups for the device.
This is what Windows does, and what Alan Stern suggested.

Btrfs: fix qgroup rescan worker initialization
commit 8d9eddad19467b008e0c881bc3133d7da94b7ec1 upstream.
We were setting the qgroup\_rescan\_running flag to true only after the
rescan worker started (which is a task run by a queue). So if a user
space task starts a rescan and immediately after asks to wait for the
rescan worker to finish, this second call might happen before the rescan
worker task starts running, in which case the rescan wait ioctl returns
immediatley, not waiting for the rescan worker to finish.
This was making the fstest btrfs/022 fail very often.

Btrfs: fix emptiness check for dirtied extent buffers at check\_leaf()
commit f177d73949bf758542ca15a1c1945bd2e802cc65 upstream.
We can not simply use the owner field from an extent buffer's header to
get the id of the respective tree when the extent buffer is from a
relocation tree. When we create the root for a relocation tree we leave
(on purpose) the owner field with the same value as the subvolume's tree
root (we do this at ctree.c:btrfs\_copy\_root()). So we must ignore extent
buffers from relocation trees, which have the BTRFS\_HEADER\_FLAG\_RELOC
flag set, because otherwise we will always consider the extent buffer
as not being the root of the tree (the root of original subvolume tree
is always different from the root of the respective relocation tree).
This lead to assertion failures when running with the integrity checker
enabled (CONFIG\_BTRFS\_FS\_CHECK\_INTEGRITY=y) such as the following:

Btrfs: fix relocation incorrectly dropping data references
commit 054570a1dc94de20e7a612cddcc5a97db9c37b6f upstream.
During relocation of a data block group we create a relocation tree
for each fs/subvol tree by making a snapshot of each tree using
btrfs\_copy\_root() and the tree's commit root, and then setting the last
snapshot field for the fs/subvol tree's root to the value of the current
transaction id minus 1. However this can lead to relocation later
dropping references that it did not create if we have qgroups enabled,
leaving the filesystem in an inconsistent state that keeps aborting
transactions.
Lets consider the following example to explain the problem, which requires
qgroups to be enabled.
We are relocating data block group Y, we have a subvolume with id 258 that
has a root at level 1, that subvolume is used to store directory entries
for snapshots and we are currently at transaction 3404.
When committing transaction 3404, we have a pending snapshot and therefore
we call btrfs\_run\_delayed\_items() at transaction.c:create\_pending\_snapshot()
in order to create its dentry at subvolume 258. This results in COWing
leaf A from root 258 in order to add the dentry. Note that leaf A
also contains file extent items referring to extents from some other
block group X (we are currently relocating block group Y). Later on, still
at create\_pending\_snapshot() we call qgroup\_account\_snapshot(), which
switches the commit root for root 258 when it calls switch\_commit\_roots(),
so now the COWed version of leaf A, lets call it leaf A', is accessible
from the commit root of tree 258. At the end of qgroup\_account\_snapshot(),
we call record\_root\_in\_trans() with 258 as its argument, which results
in btrfs\_init\_reloc\_root() being called, which in turn calls
relocation.c:create\_reloc\_root() in order to create a relocation tree
associated to root 258, which results in assigning the value of 3403
(which is the current transaction id minus 1 = 3404 - 1) to the
last\_snapshot field of root 258. When creating the relocation tree root
at ctree.c:btrfs\_copy\_root() we add a shared reference for leaf A',
corresponding to the relocation tree's root, when we call btrfs\_inc\_ref()
against the COWed root (a copy of the commit root from tree 258), which
is at level 1. So at this point leaf A' has 2 references, one normal
reference corresponding to root 258 and one shared reference corresponding
to the root of the relocation tree.
Transaction 3404 finishes its commit and transaction 3405 is started by
relocation when calling merge\_reloc\_root() for the relocation tree
associated to root 258. In the meanwhile leaf A' is COWed again, in
response to some filesystem operation, when we are still at transaction
3405. However when we COW leaf A', at ctree.c:update\_ref\_for\_cow(), we
call btrfs\_block\_can\_be\_shared() in order to figure out if other trees
refer to the leaf and if any such trees exists, add a full back reference
to leaf A' - but btrfs\_block\_can\_be\_shared() incorrectly returns false
because the following condition is false:
btrfs\_header\_generation(buf) <= btrfs\_root\_last\_snapshot(&root->root\_item)
which evaluates to 3404 <= 3403. So after leaf A' is COWed, it stays with
only one reference, corresponding to the shared reference we created when
we called btrfs\_copy\_root() to create the relocation tree's root and
btrfs\_inc\_ref() ends up not being called for leaf A' nor we end up setting
the flag BTRFS\_BLOCK\_FLAG\_FULL\_BACKREF in leaf A'. This results in not
adding shared references for the extents from block group X that leaf A'
refers to with its file extent items.
Later, after merging the relocation root we do a call to to
btrfs\_drop\_snapshot() in order to delete the relocation tree. This ends
up calling do\_walk\_down() when path->slots[1] points to leaf A', which
results in calling btrfs\_lookup\_extent\_info() to get the number of
references for leaf A', which is 1 at this time (only the shared reference
exists) and this value is stored at wc->refs[0]. After this walk\_up\_proc()
is called when wc->level is 0 and path->nodes[0] corresponds to leaf A'.
Because the current level is 0 and wc->refs[0] is 1, it does call
btrfs\_dec\_ref() against leaf A', which results in removing the single
references that the extents from block group X have which are associated
to root 258 - the expectation was to have each of these extents with 2
references - one reference for root 258 and one shared reference related
to the root of the relocation tree, and so we would drop only the shared
reference (because leaf A' was supposed to have the flag
BTRFS\_BLOCK\_FLAG\_FULL\_BACKREF set).
This leaves the filesystem in an inconsistent state as we now have file
extent items in a subvolume tree that point to extents from block group X
without references in the extent tree. So later on when we try to decrement
the references for these extents, for example due to a file unlink operation,
truncate operation or overwriting ranges of a file, we fail because the
expected references do not exist in the extent tree.
This leads to warnings and transaction aborts like the following:

[ 588.966270] BTRFS info (device sda2): forced readonly
This was happening often on openSUSE and SLE systems using btrfs as the
root filesystem (with its default layout where multiple subvolumes are
used) where balance happens in the background triggered by a cron job and
snapshots are automatically created before/after package installations,
upgrades and removals. The issue could be triggered simply by running the
following loop on the first system boot post installation:
while true; do
zypper -n in nfs-kernel-server
zypper -n rm nfs-kernel-server
done
(If we were fast enough and made that loop before the cron job triggered
a balance operation and the balance finished)
So fix by setting the last\_snapshot field of the root to the value of the
generation of its commit root. Like this btrfs\_block\_can\_be\_shared()
behaves correctly for the case where the relocation root is created during
a transaction commit and for the case where it's created before a
transaction commit.

Btrfs: fix tree search logic when replaying directory entry deletes
commit 2a7bf53f577e49c43de4ffa7776056de26db65d9 upstream.
If a log tree has a layout like the following:
leaf N:
...
item 240 key (282 DIR\_LOG\_ITEM 0) itemoff 8189 itemsize 8
dir log end 1275809046
leaf N + 1:
item 0 key (282 DIR\_LOG\_ITEM 3936149215) itemoff 16275 itemsize 8
dir log end 18446744073709551615
...
When we pass the value 1275809046 + 1 as the parameter start\_ret to the
function tree-log.c:find\_dir\_range() (done by replay\_dir\_deletes()), we
end up with path->slots[0] having the value 239 (points to the last item
of leaf N, item 240). Because the dir log item in that position has an
offset value smaller than \*start\_ret (1275809046 + 1) we need to move on
to the next leaf, however the logic for that is wrong since it compares
the current slot to the number of items in the leaf, which is smaller
and therefore we don't lookup for the next leaf but instead we set the
slot to point to an item that does not exist, at slot 240, and we later
operate on that slot which has unexpected content or in the worst case
can result in an invalid memory access (accessing beyond the last page
of leaf N's extent buffer).
So fix the logic that checks when we need to lookup at the next leaf
by first incrementing the slot and only after to check if that slot
is beyond the last item of the current leaf.

Btrfs: fix deadlock caused by fsync when logging directory entries
commit ec125cfb7ae2157af3dd45dd8abe823e3e233eec upstream.
While logging new directory entries, at tree-log.c:log\_new\_dir\_dentries(),
after we call btrfs\_search\_forward() we get a leaf with a read lock on it,
and without unlocking that leaf we can end up calling btrfs\_iget() to get
an inode pointer. The later (btrfs\_iget()) can end up doing a read-only
search on the same tree again, if the inode is not in memory already, which
ends up causing a deadlock if some other task in the meanwhile started a
write search on the tree and is attempting to write lock the same leaf
that btrfs\_search\_forward() locked while holding write locks on upper
levels of the tree blocking the read search from btrfs\_iget(). In this
scenario we get a deadlock.
So fix this by releasing the search path before calling btrfs\_iget() at
tree-log.c:log\_new\_dir\_dentries().

Btrfs: fix BUG\_ON in btrfs\_mark\_buffer\_dirty
commit ef85b25e982b5bba1530b936e283ef129f02ab9d upstream.
This can only happen with CONFIG\_BTRFS\_FS\_CHECK\_INTEGRITY=y.
Commit 1ba98d0 ("Btrfs: detect corruption when non-root leaf has zero item")
assumes that a leaf is its root when leaf->bytenr == btrfs\_root\_bytenr(root),
however, we should not use btrfs\_root\_bytenr(root) since it's mainly got
updated during committing transaction. So the check can fail when doing
COW on this leaf while it is a root.
This changes to use "if (leaf == btrfs\_root\_node(root))" instead, just like
how we check whether leaf is a root in \_\_btrfs\_cow\_block().

btrfs: limit async\_work allocation and worker func duration
commit 2939e1a86f758b55cdba73e29397dd3d94df13bc upstream.
Problem statement: unprivileged user who has read-write access to more than
one btrfs subvolume may easily consume all kernel memory (eventually
triggering oom-killer).
Reproducer (./mkrmdir below essentially loops over mkdir/rmdir):
[root@kteam1 ~]# cat prep.sh
DEV=/dev/sdb
mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
mount $DEV /mnt
for i in `seq 1 16`
do
mkdir /mnt/$i
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/SV\_$i
ID=`btrfs subvolume list /mnt |grep "SV\_$i$" |cut -d ' ' -f 2`
mount -t btrfs -o subvolid=$ID $DEV /mnt/$i
chmod a+rwx /mnt/$i
done
[root@kteam1 ~]# sh prep.sh
[maxim@kteam1 ~]$ for i in `seq 1 16`; do ./mkrmdir /mnt/$i 2000 2000 & done
[root@kteam1 ~]# for i in `seq 1 4`; do grep "kmalloc-128" /proc/slabinfo | grep -v dma; sleep 60; done
kmalloc-128 10144 10144 128 32 1 : tunables 0 0 0 : slabdata 317 317 0
kmalloc-128 9992352 9992352 128 32 1 : tunables 0 0 0 : slabdata 312261 312261 0
kmalloc-128 24226752 24226752 128 32 1 : tunables 0 0 0 : slabdata 757086 757086 0
kmalloc-128 42754240 42754240 128 32 1 : tunables 0 0 0 : slabdata 1336070 1336070 0
The huge numbers above come from insane number of async\_work-s allocated
and queued by btrfs\_wq\_run\_delayed\_node.
The problem is caused by btrfs\_wq\_run\_delayed\_node() queuing more and more
works if the number of delayed items is above BTRFS\_DELAYED\_BACKGROUND. The
worker func (btrfs\_async\_run\_delayed\_root) processes at least
BTRFS\_DELAYED\_BATCH items (if they are present in the list). So, the machinery
works as expected while the list is almost empty. As soon as it is getting
bigger, worker func starts to process more than one item at a time, it takes
longer, and the chances to have async\_works queued more than needed is getting
higher.
The problem above is worsened by another flaw of delayed-inode implementation:
if async\_work was queued in a throttling branch (number of items >=
BTRFS\_DELAYED\_WRITEBACK), corresponding worker func won't quit until
the number of items < BTRFS\_DELAYED\_BACKGROUND / 2. So, it is possible that
the func occupies CPU infinitely (up to 30sec in my experiments): while the
func is trying to drain the list, the user activity may add more and more
items to the list.
The patch fixes both problems in straightforward way: refuse queuing too
many works in btrfs\_wq\_run\_delayed\_node and bail out of worker func if
at least BTRFS\_DELAYED\_WRITEBACK items are processed.
Changed in v2: remove support of thresh == NO\_THRESHOLD.

hotplug: Make register and unregister notifier API symmetric
commit 777c6e0daebb3fcefbbd6f620410a946b07ef6d0 upstream.
Yu Zhao has noticed that \_\_unregister\_cpu\_notifier only unregisters its
notifiers when HOTPLUG\_CPU=y while the registration might succeed even
when HOTPLUG\_CPU=n if MODULE is enabled. This means that e.g. zswap
might keep a stale notifier on the list on the manual clean up during
the pool tear down and thus corrupt the list. Resulting in the following
[ 144.964346] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff880658a2be78

This can be even triggered manually by changing

Fix this issue by making unregister APIs symmetric to the register so
there are no surprises.

cifs: Fix smbencrypt() to stop pointing a scatterlist at the stack

```
smbencrypt() points a scatterlist to the stack, which is breaks if
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y.

Fix it by switching to crypto_cipher_encrypt_one().  The new code
should be considerably faster as an added benefit.

This code is nearly identical to some code that Eric Biggers
suggested.

cifs: Fix smbencrypt() to stop pointing a scatterlist at the stacksmbencrypt() points a scatterlist to the stack, which is breaks if
CONFIG\_VMAP\_STACK=y.
Fix it by switching to crypto\_cipher\_encrypt\_one(). The new code
should be considerably faster as an added benefit.
This code is nearly identical to some code that Eric Biggers
suggested.

ieee802154: atusb: do not use the stack for buffers to make them DMA ableFrom 4.9 we should really avoid using the stack here as this will not be DMA
able on various platforms. This changes the buffers already being present in
time of 4.9 being released. This should go into stable as well.
