The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10205.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a session fixation issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The session cookie `ZMSESSID` remains the same after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially hijack a user's session by obtaining their session ID before they log in. Once the legitimate user authenticates, the attacker can use the captured session ID to impersonate the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker obtaining the session ID before the user authenticates and then replaying the session ID after successful authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to intercept or obtain the session cookie before the user authenticates and then be able to use it after the user has authenticated.
