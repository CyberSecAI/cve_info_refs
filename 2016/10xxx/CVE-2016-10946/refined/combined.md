Simply awesome.
Thank you so much Ruben for making the plug-in. Can’t illustrate how much this has helped us out!
As users have pointed out, go to D3 for dummmies and read user “p\_ebox” instruction on how to get it up and running.
Thanks again.

### [Easy to implement on the dash, good support response!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/easy-to-implement-on-the-dash-good-support-response/)

It’s easy to implement on the WP dash editor, and had quick response from support. Has worked for me very well implementing a D3 viz prototype.
