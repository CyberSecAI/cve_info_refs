Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of the `$_GET['order']` parameter within the `zm-gallery-list.php` file of the ZM Gallery plugin for WordPress. While the `esc_sql()` function is used, it is incorrectly applied to the `$_GET['order']` parameter. The code constructs an SQL query using the `$_GET['orderby']` and `$_GET['order']` parameters. Although `esc_sql` is applied, it doesn't prevent SQL injection in the `order` parameter as it doesn't prevent malicious SQL syntax being passed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. The `esc_sql()` function, which is designed to escape SQL query parameters, is used incorrectly, failing to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected through the `$_GET['order']` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a blind SQL injection attack allowing them to extract sensitive data.
- The attacker can use tools like `sqlmap` to enumerate databases and tables, potentially gaining access to the WordPress database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests targeting the WordPress admin panel page for the zm_gallery plugin specifically `admin.php?page=zm_gallery`.
- The attacker manipulates the `orderby` and `order` parameters within the query string. Specifically the `order` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative access to the WordPress site to access the vulnerable admin page.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- The attacker must be familiar with SQL injection techniques and tools, like `sqlmap`.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code resides in `/wp-content/plugin/zm-gallery/zm-gallery-list.php` on line 126.
- The `zm-gallery` plugin was closed on October 21, 2015, and is no longer available for download from the official WordPress plugin repository.
- The vulnerability was discovered on December 14, 2016, and the vendor could not be contacted.
