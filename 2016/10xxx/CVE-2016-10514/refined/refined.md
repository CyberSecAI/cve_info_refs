The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The issue arises from insufficient validation of URLs, specifically within the `url_check_format` function in `include/functions.inc.php`. The original implementation using `filter_var` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` and `FILTER_FLAG_SCHEME_REQUIRED | FILTER_FLAG_HOST_REQUIRED` was not strong enough.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient URL validation: The original check failed to prevent malformed URLs.
- Potential for injection: The lack of strong validation could allow for the injection of malicious URLs

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The specific impact of exploiting this vulnerability isn't explicitly mentioned, but it could potentially lead to various issues such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if the malformed URLs are used in a way that executes code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URLs: Attackers could craft URLs that bypass the initial validation checks.
- Injection via user input: If the vulnerable function is used to process user-supplied URLs, attackers could inject malicious URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to influence URL input: The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is then processed by the vulnerable function.
- Understanding of URL structure and validation: The attacker must understand the limitations of the initial URL validation and how to construct malicious URLs that bypass it.
