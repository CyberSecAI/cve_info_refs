Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10933:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `portaudio` crate's build script downloads the PortAudio library source code over an insecure HTTP connection.
*   The downloaded archive is extracted and built without any integrity verification (no signature checking).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cleartext HTTP download:** The use of HTTP for downloading the PortAudio source code allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to intercept and modify the download.
*   **Lack of integrity check:** The build process does not verify the downloaded archive's integrity (e.g., via checksum or signature), enabling the attacker to substitute the legitimate archive with a malicious one.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful MitM attack can result in arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the malicious archive is extracted and built.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** A MitM attacker positioned on the network path between the user and the portaudio.com server can intercept the HTTP request and provide a malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user building the `portaudio` crate and the server hosting the PortAudio source code.
*   The attacker does not require any prior privileges or user interaction to execute the attack. The attack occurs during the build process.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability is present in `portaudio` crate versions up to and including 0.7.0
* There are no patched versions of this crate.
* The issue was reported in August 2016, but the advisory was not created until much later.
