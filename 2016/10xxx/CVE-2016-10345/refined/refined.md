Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10345:

*   **Vulnerability:** Phusion Passenger used a known `/tmp` filename during `passenger-install-nginx-module` execution.
*   **Root Cause:** The installer script created a temporary file in `/tmp` with a predictable name.
*   **Weakness:** Predictable temporary file name.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker could exploit this by creating a symbolic link in `/tmp` with the predictable filename, pointing to a file they want to overwrite. When `passenger-install-nginx-module` is run, it would write to the attacker-specified file, using the privileges of the user executing the installer.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation and arbitrary file overwrite. An attacker with local system access could gain the privileges of the `passenger` user or overwrite arbitrary files.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Local system access. The attacker needs to be able to create files in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Affected Versions:** Phusion Passenger versions prior to 5.1.0.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in Phusion Passenger 5.1.0 by generating temporary files in a safe temporary directory.

The CVSS v3 base score is 7.8 / 10 with metrics: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates a high severity vulnerability exploitable locally with low attack complexity, requiring low privileges, and no user interaction, potentially leading to high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
