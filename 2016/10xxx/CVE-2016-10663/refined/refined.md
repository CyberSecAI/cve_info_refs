Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `wixtoolset` package downloads an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Download:** The package uses HTTP instead of HTTPS for downloading an executable, which is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Lack of Integrity Check:** There's no indication that the downloaded executable is verified for authenticity or integrity after download.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to replace the legitimate executable with a malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution on the system where the `wixtoolset` package is installed.
*   **Compromised System:**  The attacker could potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker with a privileged network position can intercept the HTTP request for the executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Network Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic, which usually requires being on the same network as the victim, compromising the network infrastructure, or having access through a compromised ISP.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to replace the legitimate executable being downloaded with a malicious one.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to versions of `wixtoolset` <= 1.0.0.
*   No patch is available, and the package has not been updated since 2015.
*   The recommendation is to avoid using the package or ensure that it is not used on a public network.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.1, with a high severity rating.
