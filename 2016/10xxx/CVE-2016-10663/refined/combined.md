## wixtoolset downloads Resources over HTTP

High severity

GitHub Reviewed

Published

Updated Sep 12, 2023

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-cr8h-x88h-jwj2)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-cr8h-x88h-jwj2/dependabot)

## Package

npm

wixtoolset
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Affected versions of `wixtoolset` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

In scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `wixtoolset`.

## Recommendation

No patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and the package has not seen an update since 2015.

The best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available.

Alternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[CVE-2016-10663](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cr8h-x88h-jwj2 "CVE-2016-10663") concerns Wix but I can't see it addressed anywhere in the issues list. Are you aware of it and what's the resolution, if any?
