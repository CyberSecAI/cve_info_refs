Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `textract` Python library, specifically version 1.4.0, is vulnerable to OS command injection due to insufficient sanitization of filenames when processing files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS command injection vulnerability exists in the `textract.process` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a file with a maliciously crafted filename.
- The vulnerability is present because the filename is passed to an operating system command without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary OS commands can be executed on the server.
- If the server processes user-supplied files, it can lead to severe security risks.
- Attackers can potentially gain full control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a file with a malicious filename to the `textract.process` function.
- The malicious filename contains characters that are interpreted as commands by the operating system shell.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the name of a file to be processed by the textract library. This could be achieved by uploading a file to a server, or any other way that would cause the library to process the name of a file they control.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability by creating a file with a malicious name such as  `./test";gnome-calculator;#.pdf`  and then processing it using `textract.process(fileName)`. This PoC shows how the library passes the filename unsanitized to the OS, resulting in command execution.
- It clarifies that parsing user-supplied files on a server poses the greatest risk.
