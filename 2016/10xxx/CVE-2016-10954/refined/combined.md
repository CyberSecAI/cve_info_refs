## Unrestricted Upload/RCE in Neosense theme 1.7

19 Sep 2016

### Vulnerability

[Neosense](https://themeforest.net/item/neosense-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/6363229) is a WordPress theme by [dynamicpress](https://themeforest.net/user/dynamicpress/portfolio).

Neosense theme version 1.7 contains an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

Version 1.7 (and possibly earlier) includes in its theme directory a copy of the "qquploader" ajax file uploader, which does not verify user authorization. Using this uploader, an attacker can upload any file to the site. The uploaded file is placed in the `wp-content/uploads/YYYY/mm` directory, which is normally writable.

The vulnerability can be used to achieve remote code execution by uploading a PHP script with extension `.php` or `.phtml`.

### Fix

The vulnerability was fixed in Neosense theme 1.8 by switching to WordPress core functions for file uploads.
