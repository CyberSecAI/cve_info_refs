- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Neosense theme (version 1.7 and possibly earlier) includes a vulnerable copy of the "qquploader" ajax file uploader that does not verify user authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution can be achieved by uploading a PHP script.
- **Attack vectors**: By using the vulnerable "qquploader" ajax file uploader, an attacker can upload any file to the site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need access to the vulnerable uploader endpoint.
