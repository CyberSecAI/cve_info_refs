Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `sixel_decode` function within `coders/sixel.c`.
- Specifically, it is related to how memory is allocated for the `imbuf` buffer, which is used for storing decoded pixel data from SIXEL images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The code allocates memory for `imbuf` using `AcquireQuantumMemory(imsx, imsy)` where imsx and imsy default to 2048. Later, when the code needs to resize the buffer because the attributed image dimensions are bigger than the initial dimensions, the code allocates `dmbuf` with the same function and copies `imbuf` to `dmbuf`. However, the function `AcquireQuantumMemory` does not multiply the width and height of the image, leading to an allocation of smaller size than needed. The code will then copy imsx*imy from imbuf to dmbuf, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** A maliciously crafted SIXEL image could cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the application.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, buffer overflows can, in some cases, be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious SIXEL Image:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted SIXEL image.
- **Image Processing:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious SIXEL image to an application using ImageMagick for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an application or service with a malicious SIXEL image for processing.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for the buffer overflow is to use `AcquireQuantumMemory(dmsx * dmsy, 1)` rather than  `AcquireQuantumMemory(dmsx , dmsy)`.
- The vulnerability was reported by Donghai Zhu.
- The fix was part of a larger patch that addressed buffer overflows in other coders like MAP, PDB and TIFF (CALS).
- The patch was included in ImageMagick version 6.9.5-8 and 7.0.2-10.
