Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2016-10064:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `coders/tiff.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during the processing of TIFF image files. The vulnerability appears to be related to insufficient bounds checking when allocating memory or reading pixel data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a buffer overflow, meaning that more data is written to a buffer than it can hold.
*   **Integer overflow:** Integer overflow in calculations leading to heap buffer overflow.
*   **Missing/Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The code lacks proper validation of buffer sizes, image dimensions or calculated values before performing memory allocation or copy operations. This can occur when reading the image or when processing pixel data.
*   **Memory Allocation Failure:** Unchecked return values for memory allocation can lead to crashes.
*   **Lack of Sanity Check:** Lack of checking whether an allocation size multiplied by an element size actually can be represented within a size_t leading to small allocations and buffer overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to an application crash, effectively denying service to users.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description also mentions "other unspecified impact," implying the potential for more severe outcomes, such as arbitrary code execution (though this is not explicitly confirmed).
*   **Memory Corruption:** When improper casting leads to incorrect allocation sizes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF File:** The primary attack vector involves using a maliciously crafted TIFF file as input to ImageMagick. This file contains specific parameters designed to trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability, like extremely large image dimensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted file:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the ImageMagick library.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.
*   **User Interaction:** The user is required to open the crafted TIFF file.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Specific Commit:** The GitHub commit `f8877abac8e568b2f339cca70c2c3c1b6eaec288` is identified as a fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Patch Details:** Patches address the overflow with improved sanity checks and add validation before allocation and copying data to prevent the overflow.
*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.5-1.
*   **Downstream Impact:** The vulnerability affects a variety of products including multiple SUSE products, Debian and Fedora.
*   **Severity:** The severity is rated as "moderate" in some reports and "low" in others, but all suggest a high impact based on the CVSS score.
*   **Fix Implementation:** Several SUSE security advisories and Debian bug reports indicate that the fix for this vulnerability was implemented in various versions of ImageMagick.
*  **RedHat Bugzilla entry:** Red Hat Bugzilla lists this issue as CVE-2016-10064, noting "A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in ImageMagick in tiff.c file. A maliciously crafted file could cause the application to crash or possibly have other unspecified impact." and indicates a fix available in ImageMagick 6.9.5.
*   **Openwall:** The Openwall posting provides a comprehensive list of CVEs for ImageMagick issues that were fixed in various versions, and they mention "Better check for buffer overflow for TIFF handling" in reference to CVE-2016-10064.

**Summary of Changes (based on the github diff):**

The commit `f8877abac8e568b2f339cca70c2c3c1b6eaec288`  improves the buffer overflow sanity check in `coders/tiff.c`. The changes include:

*   Modifying code that allocates memory for the pixel data for TIFF files.
*   Introducing a `HeapOverflowSanityCheck` to validate if the calculated allocation is valid.
*   Changing how allocation is requested using  `AcquireQuantumMemory`.
*   Adding checks to ensure that the requested memory size for pixels is valid, preventing a heap buffer overflow.

In essence, the patch adds sanity checks to ensure that the requested memory is valid to avoid allocation problems.
