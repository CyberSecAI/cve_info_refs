### [Zedna eBook download](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/zedna-ebook-download/)

[The Fagan](https://profiles.wordpress.org/the-fagan/ "Posts by The Fagan")

Was hoping to deposit an eBook into one of my WordPress pages.
But landed up with a new page without an ebook download!
The plugin doesn’t upload pdf files it seems.
