Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10709 (though not explicitly mentioned, this content is clearly related to the pfSense vulnerability described in the CVE)

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation on the `graph` GET parameter in the `status_rrd_graph_img.php` page of pfSense. Specifically, while there's a regular expression filter for the graph parameter, it doesn't block the pipe character (`|`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the `graph` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands via the pipe character.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to remote command execution as the root user. An attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the pfSense firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker sends a crafted GET request to the `status_rrd_graph_img.php` page, injecting malicious commands into the `graph` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** A CSRF attack can be used to trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted request from a user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to the pfSense web interface. However, they do not need to have administrative privileges, as the vulnerability is exploitable by a non-administrative user with access to the graph status functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the pfSense firewall's web interface.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit utilizes octal character sequences to bypass the regular expression filter and encode a malicious PHP stager. This stager is then executed to download and execute a secondary malicious payload (e.g., a reverse shell) from a remote attacker-controlled host.
*   The provided CSRF Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrates how to leverage a user's authenticated session to send the malicious GET request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed on pfSense versions 2.2.6, 2.2.5, and 2.1.3.
*   The exploit can be delivered via CSRF.
*   The provided metasploit module can be used to test and exploit this vulnerability
*   The vulnerability was fixed in pfSense version 2.3.
