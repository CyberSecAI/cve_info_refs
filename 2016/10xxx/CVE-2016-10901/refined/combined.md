## Description

There are many sites that are crawling for user-generated reviews now, including Google Places and Google Local Search. WP Customer Reviews allows you to setup a specific page on your blog to receive customer testimonials for your business/service OR to write reviews about a product.

* WP Multisite and Multiuser (WPMU / WPMS / WordPress MU) compatible.
* All submissions are moderated, which means that YOU choose which reviews get shown.
* Reviews are displayed to visitors in a friendly format, but search engines see the Schema.org microformat.
* Multiple anti-spam measures to prevent automated spambots from submitting reviews.
* Completely customizable, including which fields to ask for, require, and show.
* Shortcodes available for inserting reviews and review form on any page or widget.
* Works with caching plugins and custom themes.
* Includes an external stylesheet so you can modify it to better fit your theme.
* Reviews can be edited by admin for content and date.
* Admin responses can be made and shown under each review.
* Support for adding your own custom fields.
* The plugin can be used on more than one page, and can be used on posts.
* Supports both `Business` and `Product` review types.
* Shows aggregate reviews microformat.
* Fast and lightweight, even including the star rating image. This plugin will not slow down your blog.
* Validates as valid XHTML 1.1 (W3C) and valid Microformats (Rich Snippets Testing Tool).
* And much more…

Almost every new feature that has been added was due to the generous support and suggestions of our users. If you have a suggestion or question, do not hesitate to ask in our forum.

WP Customer Reviews is very good. I wish it was connected to Gravatar for some added verification of an identity to help add trust to the reviews.
In general, I like the barebones nature of the plugin. I didn’t want extra features because I would lose confidence in the plugin’s compatibility over the long run.
Gravatar though, I view as necessary because the best websites that will rank high in Google will need some verification features (viewable to the reader). It’s necessary innovation. I have Wordpress comments connected to Gravatar for that reason. I would love my reviews to connect to the same system.
