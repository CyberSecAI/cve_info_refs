{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `reduce-css-calc` library allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the `calc()` CSS function by not sanitizing the input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Code injection vulnerability. The `reduce-css-calc` library doesn't properly sanitize its input and allows evaluation of arbitrary JavaScript code within the CSS calc function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious code that is executed by the server or client when processing CSS with the vulnerable library. This could lead to remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious `calc()` function within CSS, and passing this input to the vulnerable `reduce-css-calc` library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or inject input that is processed by the vulnerable `reduce-css-calc` library."
