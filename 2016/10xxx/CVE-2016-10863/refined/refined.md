The provided content describes a vulnerability in Edimax Wi-Fi Extenders EW-7438RPn Mini and 7237RPD.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) weaknesses in the web interface of the Edimax Wi-Fi Extenders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The web interface lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **XSS:** The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the device's settings (specifically the guest PSK value).
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** The device does not sanitize user supplied data leading to XSS

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
*   **Disclose the user's Wi-Fi Pre-Shared Key (PSK):** By injecting malicious JavaScript via XSS and using it to read the PSK from the device's web interface.
*   **Potentially update the device's firmware** via an XHR.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  The attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing CSRF exploits targeting the Edimax Wi-Fi Extender's configuration interface, specifically the guest PSK setting.
2.  The CSRF request injects a stored XSS payload.
3.  The user, who has previously saved their login credentials in the browser, is lured to the attacker's webpage.
4.  The malicious webpage triggers the CSRF attack which sets the XSS payload.
5.  The XSS payload executes within the user's browser, bypassing the Same-Origin Policy, and reads the PSK.
6. The PSK is then displayed to the attacker, or sent to a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious webpage.
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the user's local network.

**Additional Details:**
*   The attack relies on the user saving their device login credentials in their browser.
*   The vulnerability also allowed for firmware updates using XML HTTP Requests.
*   The vendor was informed about the issue but did not respond.
*   The article recommends that users do not store device passwords in the browser and change the default passwords.
