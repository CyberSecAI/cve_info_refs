Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `redraw-field.php` file, where user-supplied input from the `$_POST["type"]` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used to include a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is primarily described as a potential XSS attack. While the code uses `htmlspecialchars()` in some places, it does not protect the initial inclusion of files based on the `type` parameter.
- **File Inclusion:** The code uses `BigTreeCMS::urlify()` on the `$_POST["type"]` parameter, which is intended to prevent directory traversal. However, if the file name is not sufficiently sanitized after this, a malicious user could still influence which file is included.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:**  The code uses a mix of `trim()` and `htmlspecialchars()` but it does not prevent injection when using the `$_POST["type"]` parameter for file inclusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
- **File Inclusion:** An attacker could potentially include arbitrary files by manipulating the `type` parameter, potentially leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Local File Inclusion (LFI) depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the `redraw-field.php` file, which is accessed via an AJAX request by sending a `POST` request including a malicious `type` parameter.
- The `type` parameter is used to determine which field template is included. By injecting a malicious value into `$_POST["type"]`, an attacker can attempt to include an arbitrary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted `POST` requests to the server targeting `redraw-field.php`.
- The attacker would need some knowledge of the application's structure and the files it uses in order to create the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit log indicates that this vulnerability was fixed by adding additional sanitization.
- The fix in `ajax/redraw-field.php` includes htmlspecialchars() for the key, id and type parameters.
- The file `classes/btx-form-builder.php` shows changes to the way fields are selected and displayed from the database, though it doesn't seem directly related to the vulnerability being fixed.

In summary, this is a file inclusion vulnerability that can lead to XSS due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input used for file inclusion.
