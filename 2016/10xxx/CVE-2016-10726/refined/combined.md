Welcome to Release 5.11, a bug-fix release for the DSpace 5.x platform. For information on upgrading to DSpace 5, please see [Upgrading DSpace](/display/DSDOC5x/Upgrading%2BDSpace).

## 5.11 Release Notes

We highly recommend all DSpace 5.x users upgrade to 5.11

DSpace 5.11 contains security and bug fixes for both the JSPUI and XMLUI. To ensure your 5.x site is secure, **we highly recommend ALL DSpace 5.x users upgrade to DSpace 5.11.**

*DSpace 5.11 upgrade instructions are available at: [Upgrading DSpace](/display/DSDOC5x/Upgrading%2BDSpace)*

**Summary**

DSpace 5.11 is a bug fix release to resolve several issues located in previous 5.x releases. As it only provides only security and bug fixes, DSpace 5.11 should constitute an easy upgrade from DSpace 5.x for most users. No database changes should be necessary when upgrading from DSpace 5.x to 5.11.

**Security fixes include:**

* [HIGH] [CVE-2022-31195](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5) (impacts XMLUI and JSPUI) : *Path traversal vulnerability in Simple Archive Format package import (ItemImportService API). This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. This path traversal is only possible by a user with special privileges (Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server).*
  + Reported by Johannes Moritz of Ripstech
* [HIGH] [CVE-2022-31194](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-qp5m-c3m9-8q2p) (impacts JSPUI only) : *The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, just by modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only be executed by a user with submitter rights*.
  + Reported by Johannes Moritz of Ripstech
* [HIGH] [CVE-2022-31193](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m) (impacts JSPUI only) : *The JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, where an attacker can craft a malicious URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository URL. When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice.*
  + Reported by Johannes Moritz of Ripstech
* [MODERATE] [CVE-2022-31191](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-c558-5gfm-p2r8) (impacts JSPUI only) : *The JSPUI spellcheck "Did you mean" HTML escapes the data-spell attribute in the link, but not the actual displayed text. Similarly, the JSPUI autocomplete HTML does not properly escape text passed to it. Both are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS).*
  + Reported by Hassan Bhuiyan, Brunel University London
* [MODERATE] [CVE-2022-31192](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-4wm8-c2vv-xrpq) (impacts JSPUI) : *The JSPUI "Request a Copy" feature is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.*
  + Reported by Andrea Bollini of 4Science

## 5.10 Release Notes

We recommend sites dependent on Java 7, REST API and/or RDF skip DSpace 5.9 and update to DSpace 5.10

Unfortunately, bug fixes in the [DSpace 5.9 release](/display/DSPACE/DSpace%2BRelease%2B5.9%2BStatus) resulted in issues running DSpace 5.9 on Java 7, and with running the REST API and RDF interfaces. These issues are being resolved in an upcoming 5.10 release (see below for more details). Sites which are dependent on one of these features should consider upgrading directly from DSpace 5.8 to 5.10.

**Summary**

DSpace 5.10 is a bug fix release to resolve JAR dependency issues found in DSpace 5.9 for users running Java 7 (regardless of Tomcat version).

This release also addresses a bug in the DSpace 5.9 release that prevented VIEW statistics from being logged by DSpace.

Other minor bug fixes have been included in the release.

**Major bug fixes include**

* DS-4000: [DSpace 5.9 - REST Service Does Not Run](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/7347 "[DS-4000] DSpace 5.9 - REST Service Does Not Run")
* DS-3938: [After upgrading PostgreSQL JDBC driver, DSpace does not run on JDK 7](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/7285 "[DS-3938] After upgrading PostgreSQL JDBC driver, DSpace does not run on JDK 7")
* DS-4020: [DSpace 5.9 is not saving VIEW events to statistics repo (SEARCH and WORKFLOW are saved)](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/7367 "[DS-4020] DSpace 5.9 is not saving VIEW events to statistics repo (SEARCH and WORKFLOW are saved)")

**Other fixes include**

* DS-4007: [PDF Text Extractor can cause strings like "content-type" to show up in search snippets](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/7354)
  + To fully realize the benefit of this fix, a full discover reindex is recommended.

    - If you don't reindex, newly added bitstreams would no longer display the file metadata in their index. (But, old bitstreams would still continue to display file metadata until you do a full reindex).
    - Institutions unaffected/unconcerned by this bug do not need to reindex.  If you do choose to reindex, then the bug would be fully fixed
* DS-2948: [Filter-media-> file metadata indexed in full text](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/6304)
* DS-3664: [Color Profile Detection Method in ImageMagick filter is prohibitively slow](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues/7013 "[DS-3664] Color Profile Detection Method in ImageMagick filter is prohibitively slow")

In addition, this release fixes a variety of minor bugs in the 5.x releases. For more information, see the [Changes section](/display/DSPACE/DSpace%2BRelease%2B5.8%2BStatus#DSpaceRelease5.8Status-Changes) below.

**Upgrade Instructions**

* **For upgrade instructions from ANY PRIOR VERSION to 5.10, please see [Upgrading DSpace](/display/DSDOC5x/Upgrading%2BDSpace)**
* When upgrading from any 5.x version, if you're reusing your 5.x configuration, make sure to change all instances of Filter attribute "red" to "ref" (e.g. <Filter red="exampleFilter" /> to <Filter ref="exampleFilter" />) in [dspace]/config/crosswalks/oai/xoai.xml. "red" was a temporary workaround for a bug ([xoai issue #32](https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/issues/32)), which was first fixed in DSpace 5.4.

**No new features in DSpace 5.10**

5.10 is a bug-fix release. This means it includes **no new features** and only includes the above listed fixes.

For a list of all new 5.x Features, please visit the [5.x Release Notes](/display/DSDOC5x/Release%2BNotes).

### 5.10 Acknowledgments

The 5.10 release was led by [Terrence W Brady](/display/~terrywbrady).

The following individuals provided code or bug fixes to the 5.10 release: [Terrence W Brady](/display/~terrywbrady) , [Alexander Sulfrian](/display/~sulfrian) , [Philip Vissenaekens (Atmire)](/display/~philipatmire) , [Jozsef Marton](/display/~jmarton).

## 5.9 Release Notes

We highly recommend ALL JSPUI users of DSpace 5.x upgrade to 5.9

DSpace 5.9 contains security fixes for the JSPUI (only). To ensure your 5.x JSPUI site is secure, **we highly recommend ALL JSPUI DSpace 4.x users upgrade to DSpace 5.9**.

DSpace 5.x XMLUI users may also wish to upgrade as several major bugs have been fixed in the XMLUI as well.

*DSpace 5.9 upgrade instructions are available at: [Upgrading DSpace](/display/DSDOC5x/Upgrading%2BDSpace)*

DSpace 5.9 is a security & bug fix release to resolve several issues located in previous 5.x releases. As it only provides bug/security fixes, DSpace 5.9 should constitute an easy upgrade from DSpace 5.x for most users. No database changes or additional configuration changes should be necessary when upgrading from DSpace 5.x to 5.9.

**JSPUI security fixes include**

* *[HIGH SEVERITY] A user can inject malicious Javascript into the names of EPeople or Groups. This is most severe in sites which allow anyone to register for a new account.* (<https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3866> - requires a JIRA account to access.)

  + Reported by Julio Brafman
* *[MEDIUM SEVERITY] Any user was able to export metadata to CSV format if they knew the correct JSPUI path/parameters. Additionally, the exported CSV included metadata fields which are flagged as hidden in configuration.* (<https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3840> - requires a JIRA account to access.)

  + Reported by Eike Kleiner (ZHAW, Zurich University of Applied Sciences)

**Major bug fixes include**

* Update DSpace [ORCID Integration](/display/DSDOC5x/ORCID%2BIntegration) to use ORCID API v2 (instead of now obsolete ORCID v1): [DS-3447](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3447)
* Update DSpace [Statistics](/display/DSDOC5x/SOLR%2BStatistics) to use GeoIP API v2 (instead of now discontinued GeoIP API v1): [DS-3832](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3832)
* Other API-level fixes (affecting all UIs)
  + PostgreSQL JDBC driver upgraded to latest version (to allow for full compatibility with PostgreSQL v10): [DS-3854](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3854)
  + Ensure [ImageMagick thumbnails](/display/DSDOC6x/ImageMagick%2BMedia%2BFilters) respect the orientation of original file: [DS-3839](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3839)
* OAI-PMH Fixes
  + Enhanced "oai import" command to report on items that cause indexing issues: [DS-3852](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3852)
  + Fix 500 error when no Community or Collection: [DS-3853](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3853)
* XMLUI Fixes
  + Fixed Mirage v2 build issues caused by Bower Registry URL change: [DS-3936](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3936)
  + Fixed performance issues for Items with 100+ bitstreams: [DS-3883](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3883)
  + Fix issue where search results lose Community/Collection context when sorting: [DS-3835](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3835)
  + Update Mirage to use recommended [MathJax inline delimiters](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC6x/XMLUI%2BConfiguration%2Band%2BCustomization#XMLUIConfigurationandCustomization-MathJaxSupport) ([DS-3087](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3087)) and to use new CDN location ([DS-3560](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3560))

In addition, this release fixes minor bugs in the 5.x releases. For more information, see the [Changes in 5.x](/display/DSDOC5x/Changes%2Bin%2B5.x) page.

While a direct file link would be very hard to "guess" or stumble upon, this could allow an individual with deposit rights to make available content which has not been approved by local DSpace administrators. This vulnerability has at least existed since 5.0, but may effect versions as old as 3.0.
    - Discovered by Pascal-Nicolas Becker of [Technische Universität Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/)

  + Tombstones (deleted item status) are now properly applied for withdrawn items ([DS-2593](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2593))
    (note: this requires 'import' to be run, the OAI event consumer will not create tombstones automatically)
  + `dc.date.available` is now properly exposed when using the mets metadata format ([DS-2598](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2598))
* Authorization policy fixes:
  + Custom policies for items in workspace or workflow (eg. embargo lifts) are now ignored by AuthorizeManager ([DS-2614](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2614))

  + Item-level versioning now carries across all custom policies in new item versions (eg. embargos) ([DS-2358](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2358))
* Other notable fixes:
  + Optimized "Select Collection" query is now disabled by default as a workaround to ensure special group lookups (LDAP, Shibboleth, IP-based) work out-of-the-box ([DS-2673](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2673))

## 5.1 Release Notes

We highly recommend any users of DSpace 5.x upgrade to 5.1

DSpace 5.1 contains security fixes for both the XMLUI and JSPUI. To ensure your 5.x site is secure, **we highly recommend all DSpace 5.x users upgrade to DSpace 5.1**.

We also highly recommend removing any  "allowLinking=true" settings from your Tomcat's <Context> configuration. Previously our installation documentation erroneously listed examples which included "allowLinking=true", while the [Tomcat documentation lists it as a possible security concern](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/security-howto.html#Context). The XMLUI Directory Traversal Vulnerability (see below) is also exacerbated by this setting.

DSpace 1.x.x, 3.x or 4.x users may wish to consider upgrading directly to DSpace 5.1

Several of the security vulnerabilities patched in DSpace 5.1 (and backported to 4.3 and 3.4) also affect sites running unsupported DSpace 1.x.x releases. In order to ensure your site is patched, we highly recommend upgrading to [DSpace 3.4](/display/DSDOC3x/Preface), [DSpace 4.3](/display/DSDOC4x/Release%2BNotes) or DSpace 5.1.

If you are considering an upgrade from DSpace 1.x.x, note that, as of DSpace 5, your existing data (i.e. database contents, search/browse indexes) will now be automatically upgraded from ANY prior version of DSpace. Therefore, you may wish to consider upgrading directly to DSpace 5.1, as the [5.x upgrade process](/display/DSDOC5x/Upgrading%2BDSpace) is simplified.

DSpace 5.1 is a security and bug fix release to resolve several issues located in DSpace 5.0. As it only provides bug fixes, DSpace 5.1 should constitute an easy upgrade from DSpace 5.0 for most users. No database changes or additional configuration changes should be necessary when upgrading from DSpace 5.0 to 5.1.

This release addresses the following security issues discovered in DSpace 5.x and below:

* XMLUI Security Fixes
  + *[HIGH SEVERITY] XMLUI Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities* ([DS-2445](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2445) - requires a JIRA account to access for two weeks, and then will be public): These vulnerabilities allow someone to potentially access *any file* on your local filesystem which is readable to the Tomcat user account. This includes files which are unrelated to DSpace or Tomcat, but are readable to all users on the filesystem (e.g. /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, etc.). This also includes Tomcat configuration files (which may or may not contain passwords). These vulnerabilities have existed since DSpace 1.5.2.

    - Discovered by: [Khalil Shreateh](http://khalil-shreateh.com), with additional (related) vulnerabilities discovered by the DSpace Committer Team
  + In some configurations of Tomcat, simply removing any "allowLinking=true" settings from your Tomcat's <Context> configuration will limit the directory traversal vulnerability's severity to only allow access to files within the XMLUI web application directory. In addition, the [Tomcat documentation details "allowLinking=true" as a possible security concern](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/security-howto.html#Context).  However, you still must upgrade or patch your DSpace in order to completely resolve this vulnerability.
* JSPUI Security Fixes
  + *[MEDIUM SEVERITY] JSPUI Directory Traversal Vulnerability* ([DS-2448](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2448) - requires a JIRA account to access for two weeks, and then will be public): This vulnerability allows someone to potentially access any file within the JSPUI web application directory (e.g. WEB-INF/web.xml). This vulnerability is believed to have existed in all prior versions of DSpace.
    - Discovered by [Khalil Shreateh](http://khalil-shreateh.com)
  + *[LOW SEVERITY] Cross-site scripting (XSS injection) is possible in JSPUI Recent Submissions listings* ([DS-1702](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1702) - requires a JIRA account to access for two weeks, and then will be public): This vulnerability could allow a depositor/submitter to embed dangerous Javascript code into the metadata of a new submission, thus causing that code to be run across other user accounts. However, this vulnerability is only possible by someone with privileges to add content to your DSpace site. This vulnerability has existed since DSpace 1.5.x.
    - Discovered by:  Jean-Paul Zhao of [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/)
  + *[LOW SEVERITY] Cross-site scripting (XSS injection) is possible in JSPUI Discovery search form* ([DS-2044](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2044) - requires a JIRA account to access for two weeks, and then will be public): This vulnerability could allow someone to embed dangerous Javascript code into links to search results. If a user was emailed such a link and clicked it, the javascript would be run in their local browser. This vulnerability has existed since DSpace 3.x

Instead, this is an internal restructuring of data within DSpace. In the future, this provides the potential to create more enhanced metadata (or even more configurable metadata) on all objects   See [DS-1582](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1582) by Mark H.
