[fa3d30fd18c348bb4b1f3858fb860f4fcd4b2045](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?fa3d30fd18c348bb4b1f3858fb860f4fcd4b2045) Author: Tor Andersson <tor.andersson@gmail.com> Date:   Thu Jan 12 15:13:14 2017 +0100      Fix 697448: Limit the maximum program size to something reasonable.          A regular expression with lots of nested repetition can lead to     integer overflow when calculating the size of the program.          Check max program size when counting the number of instructions required     for a loop, so we can bail before integer overflow can happen. ``` |  |
