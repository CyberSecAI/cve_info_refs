- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the `regemit` function within the `mujs/regexp.c` file of the MuJS library. This occurs due to integer overflow when calculating the size of a regular expression program with nested repetitions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow, integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Processing a crafted or corrupted JavaScript file can trigger the buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the MuJS interpreter.
- **Attack vectors**:  By providing a specially crafted JavaScript file, containing a regular expression with a large number of nested repetitions, to the MuJS interpreter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JavaScript file to the vulnerable MuJS interpreter. This could be through various means depending on the application or service utilizing MuJS.
