Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the `coders/pdb.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The code within the PDB coder does not properly handle the size of allocated buffers when processing image data, leading to a potential overflow during write operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A maliciously crafted PDB file could cause the application to crash.
- **Other potential impact:** The overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the specifics of the memory layout and the way the application is compiled. This is not stated directly but is implied.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted PDB file:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted PDB (Paint Shop Pro) image file to ImageMagick for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDB image to ImageMagick. This could be through any application or service that uses the ImageMagick library to process image data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diffs show changes to `coders/pdb.c`, and the related `ChangeLog` confirms this fix is to address buffer overflow vulnerability in PDB coder.
- The vulnerability was reported by Donghai Zhu.
- The fix was implemented in commit `10b3823a7619ed22d42764733eb052c4159bc8c1`.
- The fix addresses the improper memory allocation that allowed the buffer overflow to occur in the `WritePDBImage` function.
