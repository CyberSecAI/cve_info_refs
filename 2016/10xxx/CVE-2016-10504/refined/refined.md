Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `opj_mqc_byteout` function within the `mqc.c` file of the OpenJPEG library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The `opj_mqc_byteout` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This is caused by an incorrect calculation of the required buffer size for encoding data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap overflow can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted. The Gentoo security advisory mentions arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed BMP File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed BMP file. The malformed BMP file is processed using the `opj_compress` tool.
- **Other Image Formats:** The Debian security advisory mentions the vulnerability can be triggered when processing a malformed JPEG 2000 file. The Gentoo security advisory mentions malformed PDF and j2k documents could also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted image file (BMP, PDF or JPEG 2000) to trigger the vulnerability.
- No special privileges or prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ke Liu of Tencent's Xuanwu LAB.
- The vulnerable code exists in the `opj_mqc_byteout` function of `mqc.c` file.
- The issue is triggered during the execution of `opj_compress`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding 1 to the buffer allocation size in the `opj_tcd_code_block_enc_allocate_data` function.
- The vulnerable version is prior to 2.3.0, and fixed in version 2.3.0 and later.
- The issue is related to the way data is written during compression of the image.
