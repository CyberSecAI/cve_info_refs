- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Post Indexer plugin uses user-controlled values directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or prepared statements, specifically within the `remove_posts_older_than` function. The `$period` variable is taken from user-controlled input, allowing SQL injection. The use of backticks without escaping also leads to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and use of user-controlled values directly within SQL queries. The usage of backticks also contributed to the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with super admin privileges could exploit this vulnerability to read the contents of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a super admin to exploit this vulnerability.
