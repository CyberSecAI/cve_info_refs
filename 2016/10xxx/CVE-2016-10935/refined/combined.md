I use this plugin to export a list of all product names, product ID numbers, prices, etc. Extremely useful plugin!

### [Plugin suddenly stopped working correctly, support non-existent](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-suddenly-stopped-working-correctly-support-non-existent/)

[jpsnyder](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jpsnyder/ "Posts by jpsnyder")

This plugin stopped working correctly (custom meta not exporting, filtering, order by date not working, among other things. I contacted support over 3 times when the plugin stopped working correctly for me. Still haven’t heard anything from them. That was almost 1 month ago.
This massively impacted my workflow and I had to look for an older plugin version to revert back to. Eventually that worked, but still no word from them.
Even with the fix, I’ll be looking for an alternative to this exporter from now on. I have zero faith in their support. It’s too bad, because for years it was reliable and extremely useful. Don’t know why support can’t respond to a simple issue like this.

It’s been over 6 days with barely any response, I’m having a number of issues I need addressed ASAP.
We have some automated exports that are working, we have some that aren’t. We can’t even trigger a manual export, the settings have been duplicated from existing working reports with just a category change so not sure why they aren’t working. It is causing us a lot of grief.
\*update – Finally heard back from support after a week, the developer has applied a fix (that did not take long at all). There was a conflict with WooCommerce Product Add-Ons, all seems to be working fine now. Would have been 4 or 5 stars if support was quicker (way longer than quoted 24-48 hours).

The “Pro” version has many bugs, it crashes the website, they don’t give proper support, and when you request refund they disappear from Earth.
Shameful that a plugin costing 200 dollars has a customer support system like this.
