The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10703.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the removal of null byte stripping from the `node-ecstatic` middleware. This was originally implemented to address an old bug in `url.parse`. However, it was removed because the maintainer believed the bug no longer existed and that the stripping operation was creating a regex denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regex DoS vulnerability. By removing the null byte stripping, the application is now vulnerable to attacks where crafted URLs with many null bytes can be sent. This could lead to a denial of service by exhausting server resources, due to the inefficient regex parsing of such URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): An attacker can send specially crafted URLs containing null bytes, which can cause the server to become unresponsive and unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with URLs containing null bytes (`%00`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `node-ecstatic` middleware.
