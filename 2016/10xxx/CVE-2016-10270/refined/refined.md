Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10270:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip` function in `tif_dirread.c`. The function incorrectly calculates the number of strips (`nstrips`) based on the total size of data (`bytecount`), instead of using the image length and rows per strip. This incorrect calculation can lead to `nstrips` being smaller than expected, especially when the total size of data is not sufficient to fill the whole image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** When using `TIFFReadScanline`, the code can read beyond the bounds of the `StripByCounts` and `StripOffsets` arrays due to the incorrect calculation of `nstrips`.
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The blog post by Agostino Sarubbo mentions a heap-buffer-overflow in `TIFFFillStrip` which is triggered by a crafted tiff file. This overflow is caused by the incorrect number of strips calculated by the `ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of service:**  The out-of-bounds read can potentially crash the application or lead to unpredictable behavior.
- **Memory corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the heap leading to potential code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted TIFF image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF image file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable libtiff library. No special access is required.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix involved modifying `ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip` to calculate the number of strips based on `TIFFhowmany_32(td->td_imagelength, rowsperstrip)`, instead of a logic based on the total size of data.
- The fix also reverted a change in `TIFFNumberOfStrips()` that was implemented for another vulnerability(CVE-2016-9273) since the new change was sufficient.
