The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10981.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kento Post View Counter WordPress plugin version 2.8 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when updating settings and doesn't use anti-CSRF tokens correctly which leads to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The plugin stores unsanitized user input from the `kento_pvc_numbers_lang`, `kento_pvc_today_text`, and `kento_pvc_total_text` fields directly into the database. These values are later displayed on the front-end of the website on all post footers, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **CSRF:** The plugin's settings update form lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge a request to modify the plugin settings. Although WordPress generates a nonce, it is not verified in the vulnerable code, thus rendering it ineffective.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of all users visiting the website, both authenticated and non-authenticated. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can manipulate the plugin settings, which combined with the stored XSS, allows persistent attack.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **CSRF:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form and tricks an authenticated administrator into visiting it via an email or other social engineering means.
2.  The form makes a POST request to the vulnerable plugin settings page (`wp-admin/admin.php?page=kentopvc_settings`).
3. The request injects a malicious payload within the `kento_pvc_today_text` field.
4.  **XSS:**  When any user visits any page on the affected website, the injected JavaScript payload stored in database is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged in admin to visit a malicious web page.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges on the targeted website, only to persuade a privileged user to visit a crafted webpage.
