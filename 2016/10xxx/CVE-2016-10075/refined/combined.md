No one has disputed your threat model, so we will assign an ID for
this tqdm issue: CVE-2016-10075

> No, I don't see this as a problem in git.

Does anyone know of steps that an operating-system distribution could
take to prevent this class of problem (i.e., software package A has
unusual usage expectations that make it risky for software package B
to have a dependency on A)?

Or is git in a class by itself, because its usage expectation is that
the cwd determines the location of executable programs, and anyone
writing any other software package may have to remember this special
fact?

The issue is that git is specifically designed to allow (with highest
precedence) a "repository specific configuration file" that is, on
each local system, stored in the same directory tree as the main
repository content. The example given for the CVE-2016-10075 attack
against tqdm was a "[gpg] program = " setting, which is probably not a
great example because people almost always could use the same version
of gpg for every repository. A better example is "[diff]" because
someone may need a specialized diff program if they have unusual types
of files in one repository. In other words, there is a realistic use
case for being able to configure different executable programs for
different repositories. The question is whether cwd-based
configuration is a reasonable choice.

Are the risks really much different from a hypothetical git behavior
in which (for any arbitrary cwd) it selected a diff program by doing:

  PATH=.:$PATH

?

# tqdm: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201807-01**

A vulnerability in tqdm could allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-python/tqdm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.23.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.23.3** |

### Background

tqdm is a smart progress meter.

### Description

A vulnerablility was discovered in tqdm.\_version that could allow a
malicious git log within the current working directory.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands by enticing a user to
clone a crafted repo.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All tqdm users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/tqdm-4.23.3"

```

## Description

[![@jwilk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141546?v=4&size=48)](/jwilk)[jwilk](https://github.com/jwilk)opened [on Dec 25, 2016](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/328#issue-197514386)

When you import `tqdm`, the `tqdm._version` module executes the following command:

```
git log -n 1 --oneline

```

This was meant to check if the user is running a pre-release version of tqdm.

But most of the time there's no git repo at all, so this is just waste of time.

Worse, the current working directory might be a part of an unrelated git repository, possibly a malicious one.

At least with git 2.10 or later, it's possible to craft a repo in which `git log` executes arbitrary code:

```
$ tail -n4 /tmp/.git/config
[log]
        showSignature = true
[gpg]
        program = /tmp/moogpg

$ tail -n4 /tmp/moogpg
#!/bin/sh
exec > /dev/tty 2>&1
cowsay pwned
sleep 9999

$ cd /tmp

$ pydoc tqdm
 _______
< pwned >

So, how can I fix this?  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Vande More    2004-09-11 09:13:30 UTC  ``` I reproduced this, blank config screen and all. However, it started operating properly after I restarted KDE. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  gunix    2004-09-11 23:53:20 UTC  ``` It seems to be a problem with the firewall. Turning that one off, solved the problem! ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-12 05:45:32 UTC  ``` Please do not mark local problems as fixed. If someone searches for resolved bugs, they appear in the wrong result set. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-12 05:46:11 UTC  ``` . ``` |  |
