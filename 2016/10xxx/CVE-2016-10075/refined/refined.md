Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `tqdm` library executing `git log` command to determine if the user is running a pre-release version. The `git log` command is executed without sanitizing the current working directory. Git allows configuration settings within a `.git/config` file to specify external programs to execute for certain git operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsanitized Input:** `tqdm` directly executes `git log` without validating the current working directory, which could be controlled by an attacker.
- **Git Configuration Vulnerability:** Git uses configuration files within the repository, allowing users to specify custom executables for operations such as `diff` or `gpg` program. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is triggered when `tqdm` executes a git command in a directory controlled by an attacker.
- **Lack of User Awareness:** Users may not realize that importing `tqdm` triggers the execution of a `git` command, making them vulnerable to this attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious git repository where git commands such as git log triggers execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Git Repository:** An attacker can create a git repository containing a malicious `.git/config` file that specifies a custom executable for `git log` or other operations, such as `diff` or `gpg` program which gets executed when the command is called by `tqdm`.
- **Enticement:** The attacker could entice a victim to clone this malicious repository or place the malicious .git directory in a path where the victim will execute the vulnerable code. When the victim then imports `tqdm` library, the `git log` command executes within this context, triggering the malicious executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious git repository.
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a victim to clone the malicious repository or place it within their current directory tree where they will execute a program that imports `tqdm`
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `.git/config` file of the malicious repo to include malicious configuration
