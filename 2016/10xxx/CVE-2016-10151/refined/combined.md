| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-03 11:08:16 UTC  ``` It was reported that hesiod unsafely checks EUID against UID in a few places to protect overriding certain configuration values with environment variables.  Vulnerable code:  configname = ((getuid() == geteuid()) && (getgid() == getegid())) ? getenv("HESIOD_CONFIG") : NULL;  If the process has elected to become full root, or dropped privileges while still possessing the file descriptor with additional privileges, or by some other way satisfies EUID == UID check without dropping all privileges, it can might allow privilege escalation for local attackers who are able to set the HESIOD_CONFIG or HES_DOMAIN environment variables and run affected SUID/SGUID binary.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c1)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-03 11:08:25 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Florian Weimer (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c2)  Adam Mariš    2016-05-03 11:08:39 UTC  ```  Created hesiod tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1332509](show_bug.cgi?id=1332509 "CLOSED ERRATA - hesiod: Weak SUID check allowing privilege elevation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c3)  Florian Weimer    2016-05-03 11:28:42 UTC  ``` glibc is not affected because it uses secure_getenv.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c4)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2016-05-03 17:15:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1153516](attachment.cgi?id=1153516&action=diff "proposed fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1153516&action=edit "proposed fix") proposed fix   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1332508#c5)  Doran Moppert    2017-01-18 02:33:38 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> [] Weak SUID check allowing privilege elevation
>
> Hesiod unsafely checks EUID vs UID in a few places, consulting
> environment variables for configuration if they match. This could be

Use CVE-2016-10151.

> [] Use of hard-coded DNS domain if configuration file cannot be read
>
> If opening the configuration file fails, hesiod falls back on a default
> domain ".athena.mit.edu" to retrieve managed information. A local
> attacker with the opportunity to poison DNS cache could potentially
> elevate their privileges to root by causing fopen() to fail.

> <https://github.com/achernya/hesiod/pull/10>

Use CVE-2016-10152.

Factor out logic that attempts to only consult the environment when it's safe to do so into its own function, and use secure\_getenv() instead of getenv() if it's available. Original report from
