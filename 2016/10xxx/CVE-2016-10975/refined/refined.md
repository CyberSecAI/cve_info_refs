Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10975 (Based on the description of the `Fluid Responsive Slideshow` plugin being closed due to a security issue and the content from klikki.fi describing CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CSRF:** The `frs_save()` AJAX handler in the Fluid Responsive Slideshow plugin lacked CSRF token validation (using `check_admin_referer()` or `verify_nonce()`). This allowed attackers to perform unauthorized AJAX requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Insufficient post type check:** The `frs_save` function was intended to modify slideshow objects, but it didn't validate the post type being modified.
* **Reflected XSS:** A reflected XSS vulnerability existed through the `skin` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  The missing CSRF token check allows attackers to submit unauthorized requests if a logged-in user visits a malicious page.
*   **Insecure AJAX handling:** The AJAX handler doesn't validate the post type being modified, which allows modification of any data in the `wp_posts` table.
*  **Reflected XSS**: The `skin` parameter was not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious script to be injected via URL.
*   **Stored XSS potential:** The CSRF vulnerability could be exploited to inject JavaScript into normal posts or pages, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify any content in the `wp_posts` table, including normal posts and pages through the CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Injection:** The ability to modify posts allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the website, leading to stored XSS.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If an administrator is tricked into visiting the attacker's malicious page, the injected JavaScript would execute with administrative privileges, potentially leading to a server-side compromise.
*  **Reflected XSS:** While the reflected XSS was blocked by Chrome's XSS Auditor, it could potentially be used against users who don't have such protections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress user into visiting a malicious page containing a crafted AJAX request.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a crafted URL containing the malicious script.
*   **Stored XSS (through CSRF):** Attackers could first exploit the CSRF vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into WordPress posts/pages and then redirect users to those modified posts/pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious page with a crafted AJAX request.
    *   The attacker needs to entice a logged-in WordPress user to visit the malicious page.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload.
* **Stored XSS (through CSRF)**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page, and have access to modify content via CSRF, and then trick users to visit the modified content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed on June 28, 2019 due to the security issue.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in version 2.2.7 released on May 17, 2016.
*   The CSRF vulnerability could be exploited to perform a stored XSS attack which could lead to server compromise in the admin context.
* The reflected XSS was blocked by the Chrome XSS Auditor.
