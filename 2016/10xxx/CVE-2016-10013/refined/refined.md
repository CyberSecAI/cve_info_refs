Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Xen hypervisor emulates the `SYSCALL` instruction on x86 processors when single-stepping is enabled. The hypervisor incorrectly raises the debug exception (#DB) based on the flags at the *start* of the `SYSCALL` instruction instead of the end.  This is a deviation from the typical single-stepping behavior, and this behavior difference is not clearly documented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Single-Step Exception Handling:** Xen's emulation logic for the `SYSCALL` instruction does not align with the expected behavior regarding the timing of single-step exceptions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious guest userspace process can exploit this flaw to elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. This occurs because the incorrect timing of the #DB exception allows the attacker to manipulate kernel state unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Instruction Emulator:** The attack vector involves guest userspace invoking the instruction emulator in Xen hypervisor. Specifically by using SYSCALL instruction when the guest is being single-stepped.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Space Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest virtual machine.
*   **64-bit x86 HVM Guest:** The vulnerability only affects 64-bit HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests.
*   **Instruction Emulation Invocation:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the instruction emulator using `SYSCALL` instruction.
*   **Privilege Requirements:**
    *   On Xen versions 4.6 and earlier, any guest user process could exploit the vulnerability, including unprivileged processes.
    *   On Xen 4.7 and later, only privileged guest user processes with special permissions or VMs with a non-default CPU vendor string configured can exploit the issue.

**Mitigation:**

*   The issue can be fixed by patching Xen with the patch provided by Xen project.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue does not affect PV (Paravirtualized) guests, 32-bit HVM guests, or ARM systems.
*   A 64-bit guest kernel using an IST for #DB handling will likely mitigate the issue, although it may still receive an unexpected #DB exception. Linux is not vulnerable.
