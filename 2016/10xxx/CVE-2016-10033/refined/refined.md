Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2016-10033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the way PHPMailer, before version 5.2.18, handles the `Sender` property when using the `mail()` transport in PHP. When the `Sender` property is not explicitly set, it is derived from the `From` address, which may be user-controlled. This value is then passed to PHP's `mail()` function's `$additional_parameters` which leads to command injection. Specifically, it is the lack of proper sanitization before passing the `From` address as a parameter to the `mail()` function which is the core problem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a malicious `From` email address, an attacker can inject arbitrary command-line options into the `mail()` function, leading to the execution of unintended commands by the underlying MTA. The `mail()` function uses `escapeshellcmd()` internally, which is vulnerable to being bypassed in combination with `escapeshellarg()`.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** PHPMailer's input validation for email addresses, while adhering to RFC 3696, fails to prevent injection of malicious parameters when using double quotes combined with backslash escapes. It is also susceptible to exploitation when a specific PCRE library isn't available in older versions of PHP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server user.
*   **Server Compromise:** Once RCE is achieved, an attacker could take complete control of the affected server by installing malware, creating new user accounts, or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Backdoor installation:** Arbitrary code execution can allow an attacker to install a persistent backdoor on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious parameters within the `From` address by taking advantage of the way PHPMailer handles input when using the PHP `mail()` transport.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests that include the malicious email address in a POST parameter which is then used as the `From` address in PHPMailer.
*   **Host Header Manipulation:** As seen in the provided code snippets, the Host header can be used to inject arguments, especially when combined with the `mail()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Vulnerable Application:** The target system must be running a version of PHPMailer prior to 5.2.18, and utilize the `mail()` transport mechanism with user-supplied data to set the `From` address or `Sender` property, either directly or indirectly.
*   **Exim/Sendmail MTA (Mostly Sendmail):** The server must have either Sendmail or a vulnerable version of Exim MTA installed and configured to send emails. The attacker also needs to be able to specify parameters in a way that is understood by the MTA which varies between Sendmail and Exim. This includes the ability to create new log files on the target system in a known location through injection of the `-X` parameter, or use Exim's `${run{}}` expansion variable to achieve direct code execution.

The provided content also highlights that the vulnerability is not exclusive to PHPMailer and also affects other PHP email libraries like SwiftMailer and Zend Framework and that the initial patch (5.2.20) could be bypassed via a different injection technique, which is addressed in a subsequent release (5.2.21).
