# invalid memory read in queuepush.c / function queue\_push()Â #1

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Feb 4, 2016](https://github.com/fbb-git/yodl/issues/1#issue-131258254)

Compiling yodl with address sanitizer (-fsanitize=address) shows an invalid memory read in the function queue\_push().

I tried to look at the source and find the bug, but I'm not familiar with the code base and was unable to easily determine the reason.

This can be reproduced simply by trying to compile everything with address sanitizer enabled:

CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./build programs

CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./build macros

CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./build man

This was tested with release 3.05.01. The error message from address sanitizer:

```

|  |  | \* Hanno B\"ock reported an invalid memory read found by the address sanitizer |
|  |  | (using -fsanitize=address). Fixed in this release. The address santizer |
|  |  | also reported some memory leaks which are not nice, but their fix will |
|  |  | probably take some more time. |
