  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists within a Qualcomm closed-source component.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The type of vulnerability is not specified, but is likely to be a memory corruption issue leading to code execution or privilege escalation. No details are available since the component is closed source"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the closed-source component, potentially resulting in a compromise of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The exact attack vector is unknown due to the closed-source nature of the component. It may involve processing specially crafted data or a malformed network packet that interacts with the vulnerable component.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker's capabilities and position are unknown because of the lack of details. The attacker likely needs to trigger the vulnerable code path to exploit this."
