Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the fact that, prior to specific commits, the `--tmpfs` option in Firejail allowed any non-privileged user to mount a `tmpfs` filesystem over any location, including sensitive system directories like `/etc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Mount Options:** The primary vulnerability is that a non-privileged user could use `--tmpfs` to mount a temporary filesystem over critical directories.
- **Lack of Privilege Checks:**  Firejail did not properly restrict the use of the `--tmpfs` option to privileged users (root) before the fix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain root privileges by mounting a `tmpfs` filesystem over `/etc`, modifying critical system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group`, then using a utility like `su` to become root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Command Line Argument:** The attacker uses the `--tmpfs` command-line argument to mount a tmpfs over a targeted directory.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to execute the firejail command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Non-privileged User:** The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on the target system.
- **Firejail Execution:** They need the ability to execute the `firejail` command.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The provided email thread details a series of vulnerabilities discovered in Firejail. The first, addressed by CVE-2016-10117, is the `--tmpfs` issue. A non-privileged user could use `firejail --noprofile --tmpfs=/etc` to mount a temporary filesystem over `/etc`. The attacker then modifies the contents of the directory in the tmpfs (including the files mentioned above, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/group`) in order to gain root access using `su -`.

This is a clear local privilege escalation issue. The initial email from Martin Carpenter also highlights the fact that Firejail's broad attack surface and many options were a potential source of security issues, and that there were other fixed, unassigned issues discovered at that time.

The email also provides the commit hashes which fixed this issue.
