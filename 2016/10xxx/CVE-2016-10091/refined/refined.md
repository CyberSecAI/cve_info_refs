Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10091:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `sprintf` to format integers into fixed-size character buffers within the `unrtf` program, specifically in the `cmd_expand`, `cmd_emboss`, and `cmd_engrave` functions in `convert.c`.
*   When processing RTF input, these functions could receive large negative integer parameters which, when converted to strings using `sprintf`, could exceed the allocated buffer sizes, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The `sprintf` function doesn't check the size of the output buffer, and writes past its boundary when handling large integers.
*   **Integer-to-string conversion:** The vulnerability arises from converting user-controlled integer inputs to strings, and writing these strings into fixed size buffers without proper size checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the `unrtf` program, which can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RTF Input:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious RTF document that includes specially crafted `\expnd`, `\emboss`, or `\engrave` commands with large negative integer parameters.
*   **Processing of untrusted input:**  Any application using `unrtf` to process untrusted RTF documents could be a potential vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide RTF input:** An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted RTF document as input to the vulnerable `unrtf` program.
*   **No special privileges needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring special privileges.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `unrtf` versions 0.21.5-1, 0.21.9-clean-2, and 0.21.5-3.
*   The fix involves replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf` to limit the number of characters written to the buffer and increasing buffer sizes to avoid overflows.
*   Upstream patch: <http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/unrtf/rev/3b16893a6406>
*   A proof of concept exploit was provided as a test case: `echo "\expnd-400000000" > poc; unrtf poc`
*   The vulnerability was reported on the debian bug tracker: <https://bugs.debian.org/849705>
*   The CVE was assigned as a result of the report on the debian bug tracker.
