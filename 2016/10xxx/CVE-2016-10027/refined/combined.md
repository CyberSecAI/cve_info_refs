| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1406703#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2016-12-21 09:41:57 UTC  ```   A vulnerability in the Smack XMPP library was reported where the security of the TLS connection is not always enforced. By stripping the "starttls" feature from the server response with a man-in-the-middle tool, an attacker can force the client to authenticate in clear text even if the "SecurityMode.required" TLS setting has been set.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> I reported a vulnerability in the Smack XMPP library where the security of
> the TLS connection is not always enforced. By stripping the "starttls"
> feature from the server response with a man-in-the-middle tool, an attacker
> can force the client to authenticate in clear text even if the
> "SecurityMode.required" TLS setting has been set. This is a race condition
> issue so the attack will work after a few tries.

Move TLS Required check at the end of connect()

```
It was a *very* bad idea to perform the SecurityMode.Required check in
the connection's reader thread and not at the end of
AbstractXMPPConnectin's connect(). :/

This behavior dates back to [8e75091](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/commit/8e750912a765f77a4f178a4f307a8b42c2afb5ae)

Fixes SMACK-739

A critical security vulnerability has been found in Smack. Please upgrade immediately to Smack 4.1.9. Like all Smack releases with the same major and minor version numbers, 4.1.9 is a drop in replacement for all Smack 4.1 releases. Smack 4.1.9 is available on Maven Central.

The Ignite Realtime community would like to thank Sylvain Sarméjeanne for discovering and reporting the vulnerability to security@igniterealtime.org.

Thanks for quick fix. I wonder when it will be available on the Downloads page.

As i have found out in the chat, the jars will be available on this site in a few weeks (so, around December 6th). So far one can take them from Maven Maven Repository: org.igniterealtime.smack » smack-core » 4.1.9
