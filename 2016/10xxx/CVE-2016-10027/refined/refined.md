Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2016-10027:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the TLS SecurityMode.required check was performed in the connection's reader thread instead of at the end of the `connect()` method in `AbstractXMPPConnection`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the `SecurityMode.required` TLS setting. By stripping the "starttls" feature from the server response, a man-in-the-middle attacker can force the client to authenticate in clear text even when TLS is set as required. This is due to a race condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can intercept and potentially steal sensitive information (like usernames and passwords) that would otherwise be protected by TLS encryption. The attacker can force the client to authenticate in clear text.

**Attack vectors:**
A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is required. The attacker needs to intercept the communication between the client and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and server.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in the Smack XMPP library.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in Smack version 4.1.9.
-   The issue is tracked upstream as SMACK-739.
-   The fix involved moving the TLS required check to the end of the connect() method.
-   The vulnerability is a race condition so the attack might need a few tries to work.
