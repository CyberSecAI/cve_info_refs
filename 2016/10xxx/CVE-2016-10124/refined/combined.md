# LXC: Remote security bypass — GLSA **201711-09**

A vulnerability in LXC may lead to an unauthorized security bypass.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/lxc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.7** |

### Background

LinuX Containers userspace utilities

### Description

Previous versions of lxc-attach ran a shell or the specified command
without allocating a pseudo terminal making it vulnerable to input faking
via a TIOCSTI ioctl call.

### Impact

Remote attackers can escape the container and perform unauthorized
modifications.

### Workaround

There is no know workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LXC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/lxc-2.0.7"

```

As there was not really much feedback from the vserver side and as there are
quite more issues with vserver I hoped to get rid of all those issues using
LXC. At least issue 3 is also with lxc-attach is quite the same, but
documentation of lxc-attach does not mention the risks either (at least on
Ubuntu). Calling

# lxc-attach --name buildhost-trusty -- /bin/ls

will create file outside when e.g. /bin/ls was replaced with

/root/TtyPushbackSignaling --NoSignal -- "touch /xxx"

So I guess one should not use attach to run e.g. automatic updates in the
guest or something alike.

What about "tail -f /var/log/syslog", Apache or other kind of logs for
debugging? [Yes, that's often how logs are running over the screen in videos
when talking about IT-security]. It's convenient and I'm using screen
exactly to avoid any injection of commands via TIOCSTI into my current TTY
when a context switch is needed before starting tail, e.g. when working with
LXC containers.
