Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `sirv_get_row_by_id()` function in the Sirv WordPress plugin not sanitizing the `$_POST['row_id']` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of sanitization of the `row_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the WordPress database by injecting SQL queries that retrieve information from other tables.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could gain access to higher privilege accounts or control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **`row_id` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `row_id` parameter in the POST data to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site. This can be a regular user, as the `sirv_get_row_by_id()` function is accessible to all registered users.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
add_action('wp_ajax_sirv_get_row_by_id', 'sirv_get_row_by_id');

function sirv_get_row_by_id(){

    if(!(is_array($_POST) && isset($_POST['row_id']) && defined('DOING_AJAX') && DOING_AJAX)){
        return;
    }

    global $wpdb;

    $table_name = $wpdb->prefix . 'sirv_shortcodes';

    $id = $_POST['row_id'];

    $row =  $wpdb->get_row("SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE id = $id", ARRAY_A);

    $row['images'] = unserialize($row['images']);

    echo json_encode($row);
    wp_die();
}
```

*   The `$_POST['row_id']` is directly embedded into the SQL query without any escaping or sanitization.

**Proof of Concept:**

1.  Log in as a registered user.
2.  Send a POST request to `http://target/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the following POST data:

    `action=sirv_get_row_by_id&row_id=1 UNION SELECT * FROM wp_users -- -`
   This will inject SQL code to extract data from the `wp_users` table.
