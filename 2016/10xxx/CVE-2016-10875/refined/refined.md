Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2016-10875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The changelog for version 7.4 of the "WP Database Backup" plugin mentions "Security Fix: Unauthenticated BackUp Exposure disclosed by Noah Stead (TurtleBurg)". This indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of authentication or insufficient access control, leading to exposure of backup data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is an "Unauthenticated BackUp Exposure." This means that an attacker could potentially access and download backup files without needing to authenticate or have proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive database backups. This can lead to:

*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive information stored in the WordPress database, including user credentials, personal data, and confidential content.
*   **Complete Site Compromise:** An attacker can use the database backup to restore a site on their own server and gain full control over the website.
*   **Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate the data to insert malicious scripts or modify site information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves direct access to the backup files via an unauthenticated route, likely through a publicly accessible URL or directory path, where the backup files are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to identify the exposed backup file path. This could be achieved through various means:

*   **Information Disclosure:** Discovering the path through publicly available information, exposed configurations, or predictable naming conventions.
*   **Direct Enumeration:** Trying various combinations of common file locations or paths.
*   **Scanning:** Employing automated tools to scan for publicly available backup files on the server.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated backup exposure
*   **Root cause:** Lack of authentication/access control
*   **Impact:** Sensitive database exposure, site compromise
*   **Attack vector:** Unauthenticated access to backup files
*   **Attacker position:** Ability to identify exposed backup file path
