## Description

* Multiple Vulnerabilities in Python (CVE-2016-5636, CVE-2016-5699, CVE-2016-0772) (SPL-128812)
* HTTP Request Injection in Splunk Web (SPL-128840)

At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where these vulnerabilities have been actively exploited. Previous Product Security Announcements can be found on our Splunk Product Security Portal. Use SPL numbers when referencing issues in communication with Splunk. If there is no Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier listed with a vulnerability, it will be added once it is assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority. To standardize the calculation of severity scores for each vulnerability, when appropriate, Splunk uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 2 (CVSS v2).

    ## Mitigate with Upgrades

    To mitigate these issues, Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest release and applying as many of the Hardening Standards from the Securing Splunk documentation as are relevant to your environment. Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Light releases are cumulative, meaning that future releases will contain fixes to these vulnerabilities, new features and other bug fixes.
* HTTP Request Injection in Splunk Web (SPL-128840): Blocking REST API access (8089 by default) helps block successful exploitation of this issue.
  ## Vulnerability Descriptions and Ratings

  ### Multiple Vulnerabilities in Python (CVE-2016-5636, CVE-2016-5699, CVE-2016-0772) (SPL-128812)

  **Description**:Splunk Enterprise versions 6.5.x before 6.5.1, 6.4.x before 6.4.5, 6.3.x before 6.3.8, 6.2.x before 6.2.12, 6.1.x before 6.1.12, 6.0.x before 6.0.13, 5.0.x before 5.0.17 and Splunk Light versions before 6.5.1 are affected by multiple vulnerabilities in Python (1, 2, 3). Python 2.7.12 security fixes were backported.

**Notes**: These Python issues were not addressed in Splunk Enterprise 6.4.4 and Splunk Enterprise 6.5.0. These CVEs are fully addressed in Splunk Enterprise 6.5.1, Splunk Light 6.5.1, and Splunk Enterprise 6.4.5.

### HTTP Request Injection in Splunk Web (SPL-128840)

**Description**: Splunk Enterprise versions 6.4.x before 6.4.4, 6.3.x before 6.3.8, 6.2.x before 6.2.12, 6.1.x before 6.1.12, 6.0.x before 6.0.13, 5.0.x before 5.0.17 are affected by an HTTP request injection vulnerability that permits leakage of authentication tokens. The authorization tokens permit an attacker to use the Splunk REST API with the same rights as the user.

**Credits**: Splunk would like to thank Francesco Oddo/security-assessment.com for reporting this issue.
