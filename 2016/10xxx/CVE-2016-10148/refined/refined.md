Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the WordPress Core Ajax handlers, specifically `wp_ajax_update_plugin()` and `wp_ajax_delete_plugin()`. The core issue was that capability checks were not performed early enough in the execution flow of these functions, making them susceptible to exploitation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the plugin path, potentially accessing files outside the intended plugin directory.
- **Inadequate Capability Checks:** The capability checks (verifying if the user has permission to update or delete plugins) were performed too late in the process. This allowed malicious requests to reach the vulnerable file access logic before being stopped by permission checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An authenticated user, even with low privileges such as a subscriber, could potentially exploit the vulnerability to create a denial of service condition on the affected WordPress site. This could be achieved by manipulating the plugin path and causing the affected methods to fail or throw errors in a way that makes the site unavailable.
- **Information Disclosure:** Though not explicitly stated, path traversal vulnerabilities can sometimes also lead to information disclosure, if sensitive files are accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
- **WordPress Admin API (AJAX):** The vulnerability is specifically located in the AJAX handlers. It can be triggered by sending a crafted AJAX request to the WordPress server.
- **Maliciously Crafted Plugin Path:** The attacker sends a request that includes a modified plugin path in the `$_POST['plugin']` variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site.
- **Low Privilege Account:** It's mentioned that even a user with "Subscriber" role can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Access to WordPress Admin AJAX interface:** The attacker must be able to send authenticated AJAX requests to the WordPress backend.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in WordPress version 4.5.3 and was fixed in version 4.6.
- The fix involves moving the capability checks to the top of the affected methods, before any file operations are performed.
- The vulnerability was assigned OVE-20160712-0036.
- The associated WordPress Trac ticket is #37490.
- The fix was implemented in changeset [38168](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/38168).
