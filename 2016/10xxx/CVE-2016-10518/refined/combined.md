[`40a9d68`](/websockets/ws/commit/40a9d686288b5d0be13f2bf2f3f5da07afc8cda2)

There has been vulnerability in the ping functionality of the `ws` module which allowed clients to allocate memory by simply sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. This is exactly what you expect, but internally we always transform all data that we need to send to a `Buffer` instance and this is where the problem was. We didn't do any checks for the type of data we were sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.

```
var x = new Buffer(100);
// vs
var x = new Buffer('100');
```

This would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with `100` as value in the second example. So when the server would receive a ping message of `1000` it would allocate 1000 bytes on the server and returned non-zeroed buffer to the client instead of the actual `100` message.

```
var ws = require('ws')

var server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })
var client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')

client.on('open', function () {
  console.log('open')
  client.ping(50) // this makes the server return a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes

  client.on('pong', function (data) {
    console.log('got pong')
    console.log(data) // a non-zeroed out allocated buffer returned from the server
  })
})
```

As you can imagine that is pretty darn dangerous so we fixed it as soon as we received a heads up about this. So I would like to thank [@feross](https://github.com/feross) and [@mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh) for discovering this vulnerability and disclosing it to me so it could be resolved asap.

Incorrect advisory <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67>

 [Raw](/c0nrad/e92005446c480707a74a/raw/36d43b47a6d497c64392e83adb4b79740ab412a1/writeup.md)

# <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/67>

### @xc0nradx

### @nodesecurity @feross @mafintosh

## Description

The writeup implies that the websocket server will receive the number 50, and by type confusion accidentally allocate an uninitialized buffer of size 50. The buffer will then be sent to the client as the pong response. Using this bug, a malicious actor can potentially read memory off vulnerable servers.

But, after playing around with the PoC, I don’t think this is correct. I think the actual problem is in the client. If you track down client.ping, you’ll see that calling client.ping(50) actually allocates the buffer and sends it to the server. So the server is simply responding with the clients memory buffer. The server never allocates 50 bytes of uninitialized memory and sends it back to the client. It's doing exactly what it should be doing.

To prove this, we're going to print out exactly what the client is sending, and what the server receives.

## Demo

Using ws: "1.0.0"

Server PoC:

```
var ws = require('ws').Server;

var WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server;
var wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8085 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
    console.log('received: %s', message);
  });

  ws.send('something');
});

console.log("websocket server listening on :8085")

```

Client PoC:

```
var ws = require('ws')

var client = new ws('ws://demo.server.com:8085')

client.on('open', function () {
  console.log('open')
  client.ping(50) // this makes the server return a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes

  client.on('pong', function (data) {
    console.log('got pong');
    console.log(data) // a non-zeroed out allocated buffer returned from the server
  })
})

```

Then modify line 647 of the server’s ws package to print out the unmasked data.
<https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/753937ff1ddc0938513267b4d6d5139a6ad41746/lib/Receiver.js#L647>

Then modify line 158 of the client’s ws package to print out the payload before it is sent to the server.
<https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/753937ff1ddc0938513267b4d6d5139a6ad41746/lib/Sender.js#L158>

Running the PoC you should see something similar to:
[![example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/368495d7f6f15db676e4fd6ec699a8a1413b5bf30efbe9a92f4abcfef56e8c34/687474703a2f2f63306e7261642e696f2f6e6f7365626c6565642e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/368495d7f6f15db676e4fd6ec699a8a1413b5bf30efbe9a92f4abcfef56e8c34/687474703a2f2f63306e7261642e696f2f6e6f7365626c6565642e706e67)

This means that the problem was actually in client.ping, not the server’s pong response.

## The Fix

Even though the advisory is wrong, the fix is still correct.
<https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/29293ed11b679e0366fa0f6bb9310b330dafd795>

The fix converts the client.ping(50) into essentially client.ping(‘50’) inside of the sender.

I also attempted to exploit just the server using a golang client implementation. I believe everything server side is coerced to type Buffer. So there was no real vulnerability. (except for clients potentially spewing their memory all over the place).

golang PoC:

You're correct. The disclosure, as currently written, overstates the severity of the problem.

Still, it's important that this was fixed because it might be possible to get a server to call one of these:

```
socket.send(number)
socket.ping(number)
socket.pong(number)
```

especially if the socket server has some echo functionality:

```
server.on('connection', function (socket) {
  socket.on('message', function (message) {
    message = JSON.parse(message)
    if (message.type === 'echo') {
      socket.send(message.data)
    }
  })
})
```

`socket.send(number)` called on the server, will disclose server memory.

Sorry, something went wrong.
