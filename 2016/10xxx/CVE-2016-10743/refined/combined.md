## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

Package        : wpa
Version        : 2.3-1+deb8u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-10743

It was found that the fallback mechanism for generating a WPS pin in
hostapd, an IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,
used a low quality pseudorandom number generator. This was resolved by
using only the high quality os_get_random function.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.3-1+deb8u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

--[ Vulnerabilities Summary:

Date Published: 27/02/2020
CVE Names: CVE-2016-10743 and CVE-2019-10064.
Title: Hostapd fails at seeding PRNGs
Class: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Impact: Remote network access, remote Denial of Service
Advisory URL: <https://moabi.com/advisories/CVE-2019-10064.html>

--[ Synopsis:

Hostapd (host access point daemon) is a user space daemon software
enabling a network
interface card to act as an access point and authentication server. It
is powering
billions of IoT devices.

It has been discovered that hostapd before version 2.6 wasn't seeding
PRNGs at all.
This vulnerability has been fixed silently around 2016, but never
attributed a CVE
number, leading to many distributions and IoT devices still shipping
this version of
the software. This vulnerability has been given id CVE-2016-10743.
In some configurations, when WPS is enabled and a /dev/urandom device
isn't available,
this leads to WPS PINS being predictable, allowing remote network access
from an attacker.

In addition, it has been discovered that the Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP) mode,
which offers a protection against flooding attacks, also uses
predictable PRNGs. This
vulnerability has been assigned id CVE-2019-10064.

In all cases, os_random() is not seeded, and therefor entirely
predictable and repeatable.

This is exploitable via the WPS PIN generation, as detailed here:

  }

 }

* details for CVE-2019-10064:

The EAP mode features a flood prevention technique, which is defeated
due to lack of proper seeding of PRNGs:

<https://github.com/jmalinen/hostap/blob/a06b1070d8902460a9c61a3e13af577327fce6b3/src/eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c>

  if (data->out_frag_pos)

   return;

  data->outbuf = wpabuf_alloc(sizeof(struct eap_pwd_id) +

         data->id_server_len);

  if (data->outbuf == NULL) {

   eap_pwd_state(data, FAILURE);

   return;

  }

  /* an lfsr is good enough to generate unpredictable tokens */

  data->token = os_random();

  wpabuf_put_be16(data->outbuf, data->group_num);

  wpabuf_put_u8(data->outbuf, EAP_PWD_DEFAULT_RAND_FUNC);

  (etc.)

--[ Suggested patch:

It is recommended to seed PRNGs by reading /dev/urandom, for instance
using the routine below:

/**
* Get a random seed
*/
int getseed(void) {
        int fd;
        int r, n;

        fd = open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
                perror("open");
                exit(0);
        }
        n = read(fd, &r, sizeof(r));
        if(n != sizeof(r)){
                perror("read");
                exit(0);
        }
        close(fd);
        return(r);

It should be noted that this is referring to an old release from 2016 and
pointing to a repository that is an ancient snapshot of the actual project
development repository, i.e., not discussing what is in the real
development tree or recent releases.

This is very unlikely to be hit in any realistic system using WPS. hostapd
used /dev/urandom to generate the WPS PIN if explicitly requested by upper
layer management software to enable a random PIN. The insecure random() use
would be reachable only if the device did not have a working /dev/urandom.
Furthermore, use of a random WPS AP PIN is not common deployment model (PIN
value from an upper layer software or manufacturing time configuration was
used more commonly).

Claiming this to result in remote network access is going pretty far. And
that change of removing the fallback mechanism for the broken /dev/urandom
case is a reasonable improvement in being more defensive in security
related functionality, but claiming this to be a silent fix for a
vulnerability is not accurate.

This is referring to the EAP-pwd server functionality in hostapd. The
particular value in question is the anti-clogging token value which is
defined in RFC 5931 as "MUST be unpredictable and SHOULD NOT be from a
source of random entropy" and the author of that implementation (and the
protocol designer) was explicitly documenting the used LFSR to be
sufficient for the particular use. That said, all recent releases of
hostapd are using /dev/urandom -based values for this as well.

# USN-3944-1: wpa\_supplicant and hostapd vulnerabilities

10 April 2019

Several security issues were fixed in wpa\_supplicant and hostapd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [wpa](/security/cves?package=wpa) - client support for WPA and WPA2

## Details

It was discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd were vulnerable to a

side channel attack against EAP-pwd. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to recover certain passwords. ([CVE-2019-9495](/security/CVE-2019-9495))

Mathy Vanhoef discovered that wpa\_supplicant and hostapd incorrectly

validated received scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit messages. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a reflection

attack and authenticate without the appropriate password. ([CVE-2019-9497](/security/CVE-2019-9497),

[CVE-2019-9498](/security/CVE-2019-9498), [CVE-2019-9499](/security/CVE-2019-9499))

It was discovered that hostapd incorrectly handled obtaining random

numbers. In rare cases where the urandom device isn't available, it would

fall back to using a low-quality PRNG. This issue only affected Ubuntu

14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-10743](/security/CVE-2016-10743))

--[ Vulnerabilities Summary:

Date Published: 27/02/2020
CVE Names: CVE-2016-10743 and CVE-2019-10064.
Title: Hostapd fails at seeding PRNGs
Class: CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Impact: Remote network access, remote Denial of Service
Advisory URL: <https://moabi.com/advisories/CVE-2019-10064.html>

--[ Synopsis:

Hostapd (host access point daemon) is a user space daemon software
enabling a network
interface card to act as an access point and authentication server. It
is powering
billions of IoT devices.

It has been discovered that hostapd before version 2.6 wasn't seeding
PRNGs at all.
This vulnerability has been fixed silently around 2016, but never
attributed a CVE
number, leading to many distributions and IoT devices still shipping
this version of
the software. This vulnerability has been given id CVE-2016-10743.
In some configurations, when WPS is enabled and a /dev/urandom device
isn't available,
this leads to WPS PINS being predictable, allowing remote network access
from an attacker.

In addition, it has been discovered that the Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP) mode,
which offers a protection against flooding attacks, also uses
predictable PRNGs. This
vulnerability has been assigned id CVE-2019-10064.

CVE-2016-10743 has been silently patched with commit:
98a516eae8260e6fd5c48ddecf8d006285da7389 on <http://w1.fi/hostap.git> on
Tue Feb 9 14:47:47 2016 +0000 by Nick Lowe <nick.lowe@...atech.com>

<https://github.com/jmalinen/hostap/blob/a06b1070d8902460a9c61a3e13af577327fce6b3/src/utils/os_win32.c>

 {

  return rand();

 }

<https://github.com/jmalinen/hostap/blob/a06b1070d8902460a9c61a3e13af577327fce6b3/src/utils/os_internal.c>

unsigned long os_random(void)

 {

  return random();

 }

In all cases, os_random() is not seeded, and therefor entirely
predictable and repeatable.

This is exploitable via the WPS PIN generation, as detailed here:

<https://github.com/jmalinen/hostap/blob/a06b1070d8902460a9c61a3e13af577327fce6b3/src/wps/wps_common.c>

/**

  * wps_generate_pin - Generate a random PIN

  * Returns: Eight digit PIN (i.e., including the checksum digit)

  */

 unsigned int wps_generate_pin(void)

 {

  unsigned int val;

  /* Generate seven random digits for the PIN */

  if (random_get_bytes((unsigned char *) &val, sizeof(val)) < 0) {

   struct os_time now;

   os_get_time(&now);

   val = os_random() ^ now.sec ^ now.usec;

  }

  val %= 10000000;

  /* Append checksum digit */

  return val * 10 + wps_pin_checksum(val);

 }

* details for CVE-2019-10064:

The EAP mode features a flood prevention technique, which is defeated
due to lack of proper seeding of PRNGs:

<https://github.com/jmalinen/hostap/blob/a06b1070d8902460a9c61a3e13af577327fce6b3/src/eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c>

 static void eap_pwd_build_id_req(struct eap_sm *sm, struct eap_pwd_data
*data,

      u8 id)

 {

  wpa_printf(MSG_DEBUG, "EAP-pwd: ID/Request");

  /*

   * if we're fragmenting then we already have an id request, just return

   */

  if (data->out_frag_pos)

   return;

  data->outbuf = wpabuf_alloc(sizeof(struct eap_pwd_id) +

         data->id_server_len);

  if (data->outbuf == NULL) {

   eap_pwd_state(data, FAILURE);

   return;

  }

  /* an lfsr is good enough to generate unpredictable tokens */

  data->token = os_random();

  wpabuf_put_be16(data->outbuf, data->group_num);

  wpabuf_put_u8(data->outbuf, EAP_PWD_DEFAULT_RAND_FUNC);

  (etc.)

--[ Suggested patch:

It is recommended to seed PRNGs by reading /dev/urandom, for instance
using the routine below:

/**
* Get a random seed
*/
int getseed(void) {
        int fd;
        int r, n;

	fd = open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
                perror("open");
                exit(0);
        }
        n = read(fd, &r, sizeof(r));
	if(n != sizeof(r)){
                perror("read");
                exit(0);
	}
        close(fd);
        return(r);
}

WPS: Use only os\_get\_random() for PIN generationRemove the fallback dependency on os\_random() when generating a WPS pin.
This is exceptionally unlikely to ever be called as the call to
os\_get\_random() is unlikely to fail. The intention is to facilitate
future removal of os\_random() as it uses a low quality PRNG.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
