```
{
  "CVE-2016-10743": {
    "Root cause": "The `os_random()` function used by hostapd and wpa_supplicant for generating WPS PINs and EAP tokens was not properly seeded, leading to predictable outputs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient entropy in PRNG seeding",
      "Use of low-quality PRNG (`rand()` or `random()` without proper seeding)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Predictable WPS PINs, potentially allowing unauthorized remote network access. Also, a lack of unpredictability in EAP tokens could defeat flood protection mechanisms, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation of predictable WPS PIN generation to gain unauthorized network access.",
      "Exploitation of predictable EAP tokens to bypass flood protection and mount denial-of-service attacks."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be within range of the vulnerable access point and able to intercept WPS or EAP authentication traffic. For WPS, the attacker needs to initiate the PIN authentication process."
