Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2016-10329:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `login.php` script in Synology Photo Station doesn't properly sanitize the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header. It takes the value of this header directly and uses it within a system command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied data from the `X-Forwarded-For` header before using it in a command.
*   **Command Injection:**  By injecting shell metacharacters (e.g., `";command;"`) into the `X-Forwarded-For` header, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute system commands with the privileges of the web server user (http).
*   **Privilege Escalation (Combined with setuid issue):**  Due to a setuid vulnerability in the `synophoto_dsm_user` binary, an attacker can escalate their privileges to root. This can be achieved by using the command injection to create a file, and then use `synophoto_dsm_user` to overwrite a system file (e.g., `/etc/crontab`), leading to root level access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `login.php` script, including a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Synology Photo Station server.
*   No authentication is required for the initial command injection, as the `login.php` is likely accessible without authentication.
*   Basic knowledge of HTTP headers and shell commands is needed to craft the malicious header and the follow-up steps for privilege escalation.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The vulnerable code snippet is within `appstore/PhotoStation/photo/login.php`. The application uses the value of the `X-Forwarded-For` header directly, within a call to `system()`:
    ```php
    $ip = $x_forward;
    $commend = "/usr/syno/bin/synoautoblock --reset \"".$ip."\"";
    @system($commend, $retval);
    ```
2.  An example of the malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header:  `X-Forwarded-For: ";id>/tmp/hack;"`. This injects the `id` command, redirecting the output to `/tmp/hack`.
3.  The `synophoto_dsm_user` binary has the setuid bit set: `-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root`. This allows it to be executed with root privileges.
4.  The attacker can then use `synophoto_dsm_user` to overwrite system files like `/etc/crontab`, causing arbitrary code to execute as root when cron runs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Photo Station version 6.3-2958.
*   The advisory also lists CVE-2016-10330 and CVE-2016-10331, which are related to unauthorized file copying and downloading respectively.
