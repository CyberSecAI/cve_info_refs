IMHO for such crucial parts of the system there should be unstubed version of this spec (without `allow_any_instance_of`)

Sorry, something went wrong.

FWIW, after enabling the CSRF protection I ran into the problem:

[rails/rails#21948 (comment)](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/21948#issuecomment-307165595)

It might or might not be related to how forms are created in RailsAdmin specifically.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I also can't submit forms because of this. Reported here: [#2830](https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/issues/2830)
