Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-10133:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
- A logical error in the `jsR_calllwfunction` function within `jsrun.c` leads to an incorrect stack pointer update. Specifically, when a function is called with more arguments than it expects, the code attempts to pop extra arguments from the stack. However, a calculation error causes the stack pointer to be incremented instead of decremented, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow write: The incorrect stack pointer manipulation allows writing outside of allocated stack memory.
- Stack overflow:  While not the primary issue, the vulnerability involves bypassing stack size checks and overrunning the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The heap buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting memory can cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code: Exploitation requires crafting a JavaScript file that calls a function with more parameters than it expects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious JavaScript file to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `jsrun.c`, specifically within the `js_stackoverflow` and `jsR_calllwfunction` functions.
- The `js_stackoverflow` function is called when the stack is overflowed.
- The `jsR_calllwfunction` function at line 940, which has the flawed logic: `if (n > F->numparams) { js_pop(J, F->numparams - n); }` . When `n > F->numparams`, `F->numparams - n` becomes negative, and the subsequent `js_pop` function increments the stack pointer instead of decrementing it.
- The program has a stack size defined as `JS_STACKSIZE` which is set to 256 virtual stack frames, 4096 bytes.
- The vulnerability bypasses the stack size checking due to incorrect calculation in `js_pop` function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered using Address Sanitizer (ASan) which reported a heap-buffer-overflow in `js_stackoverflow` function.
- The fix involves modifying line 940 in `jsrun.c` to `js_pop(J, n - F->numparams);`
- The issue was fixed in commit `77ab465f1c394bb77f00966cd950650f3f53cb24`.
