Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `_TIFFmemcpy` function within `tif_unix.c`. This occurs because the `readContigStripsIntoBuffer` function in `tools/tiffcrop.c` does not correctly increment the output buffer, leading to writes outside of the allocated buffer boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Writing beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.
- Incorrect buffer handling: The `readContigStripsIntoBuffer` function incorrectly manages the output buffer's pointer during processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Overwriting heap memory, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can be leveraged for code execution under specific circumstances. The advisory from debian indicates that execution of arbitrary code is a possible result.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted TIFF image: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image.
- Command-line tool: The `tiffcrop` utility, which uses the vulnerable `_TIFFmemcpy` function via `readContigStripsIntoBuffer`, is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide malicious input: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF image to the `tiffcrop` tool.
- User interaction: A user must run the `tiffcrop` command on the malicious image.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo and reported on the maptools bug tracker.
- The bug was present in libtiff version 4.0.7 and possibly earlier versions.
- The fix involves correctly incrementing the output buffer in `tools/tiffcrop.c` to avoid writing outside of bounds.
- The vulnerability is also related to [bug 2620](http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2620)
- The fix is associated with commit [9657bbe3cdce4aaa90e07d50c1c70ae52da0ba6a](https://github.com/vadz/libtiff/commit/9657bbe3cdce4aaa90e07d50c1c70ae52da0ba6a)
