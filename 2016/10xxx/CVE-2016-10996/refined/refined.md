Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The OptinMonster plugin's AJAX handler allows execution of arbitrary WordPress shortcodes via the `do_shortcode()` function. Although this function is protected by `check_ajax_referer()`, the required nonce is leaked on any page load that calls `wp_footer`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The primary vulnerability lies in the ability of unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary WordPress shortcodes. This is due to the plugin's AJAX handler passing user-provided input directly to the `do_shortcode()` function.
*   **Nonce Leakage:** The plugin leaks the nonce required to pass the `check_ajax_referer()` check through the `wp_footer` action. This allows attackers to bypass the intended protection mechanism.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the `do_shortcode()` function, which can lead to the execution of potentially malicious shortcodes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While most default shortcodes don't provide significant leverage, the vulnerability can be exploited via third-party plugins that expect shortcode execution to be a sign of sufficient user permission. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including arbitrary code execution.
*   **Site Compromise:** By exploiting vulnerable shortcodes, attackers could potentially gain control over the affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The attack vector is through crafted AJAX requests to the plugin's AJAX handler.
*   **Nonce Harvesting:** The attacker first needs to retrieve the leaked nonce from the website's HTML source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send AJAX requests and how to extract the nonce.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

* The vulnerability was discovered by James Golovich from Pritect Network on March 22, 2016.
* The vulnerability affects OptinMonster versions prior to 1.1.4.6.
* The vulnerable function is within the plugin's AJAX handler which is fired on the WordPress `init` action.
* The `omapi` nonce is leaked due to being called by the `wp_footer` action.
* The `do_shortcode()` function is vulnerable because user-provided input is passed without sanitization.
