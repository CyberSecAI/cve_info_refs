# OptinMonster < 1.1.4.6 allows execution of arbitrary WordPress shortcodes

by [James Golovich](https://www.pritect.net/blog/author/james)

March 22, 2016

[OptinMonster](http://optinmonster.com/) is a WordPress plugin/service to collect leads from customers visiting a website. The plugin is free to download from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/optinmonster/) and it claims there are 20,000+ active installs. The service does require a membership, so presumably they have contacted all of their customers to tell them to upgrade.

I discovered an issue that allows any non-authenticated user to execute arbitrary [WordPress shortcodes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode). Generally this type of access is only allowed by users with the ability to edit content on a site. Most of the default shortcodes aren’t very exciting and don’t provide much leverage for an attacker, but many third-party plugins expect that anyone who is able to execute shortcodes has sufficient permission that they don’t need to provide any further security.

The exact function is protected by the ‘omapi’ [nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces), unfortunately that [nonce](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) is leaked on any page load that calls [wp\_footer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_footer).

## Arbitrary shortcode execution

During initialization the [OptinMonster plugin](http://optinmonster.com/) sets up it’s own ajax handler which will fire off on the [‘init’ WordPress action](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/init).

[![optinmonster-ajax](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-ajax.png)](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-ajax.png)

Only two ‘actions’ can be called from this function.

[![optinmonster-ajax1](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-ajax1.png)](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-ajax1.png)

Here we see that any arbitrary user input is passed to the [do\_shortcode() WordPress function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_shortcode/). At least the function is protected by check\_ajax\_referer() which will verify the nonce.

[![optinmonster-shortcode](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-shortcode.png)](http://www.pritect.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/optinmonster-shortcode.png)

Unfortunately, the nonce is leaked during most page loads by the ‘wp\_footer’ action.

### Exit Intent Popups and OnSite Retargeting

Did you know that over 70% of visitors abandoning your website will never return?

OptinMonster’s signature [exit-intent popup technology](https://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme) can help you convert abandoning visitors into subscribers and customers.

With exit intent popups, visitors see a popup message with your best offer at the precise moment they’re about to leave.

Exit popups are proven to convert an additional 2 – 4% of your visitors into email subscribers and paying customers.

You can use exit intent popups combined with [OnSite Retargeting](https://optinmonster.com/features/onsite-retargeting/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme) to show different popup messages to new visitors vs returning visitors.

These advanced popup triggers are highly effective in growing your email list, reducing cart abandonment, and saving you moeny on PPC advertising and retargeting ads.

> In only 7 months, we added more than 95,000 names to our email list using OptinMonster’s Exit Intent™ technology. We strongly recommend it!
>
> Michael Stelzner, Founder of Social Media Examiner [See Case Study](https://optinmonster.com/how-social-media-examiner-250000-subscribers-using-optinmonster-split-testing/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme)

### Smart Page Targeting and Behavior Based Personalization

And the **[best WordPress popup plugin](https://optinmonster.com/best-wordpress-popup-plugins/?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme)** comes with advanced page targeting and behavior based personalization, too!

This means you can show a popup for specific page or section of your site, or based on users’ geolocation, or even when a visitor clicks a specific link…and so much more.

You can even show unique popups based on user’s past behavior such as: have they clicked on an existing marketing popup, seen another popup campaign, closed a marketing popup, viewed X number of pages, etc.

These personalization features of OptinMonster popups make them highly effective in improving your lead generation, increasing subscribers, and growing sales.

> Using OptinMonster, I was able to increase sales $55,000 after capturing nearly 7% more leads with a single optin!
>
> Cole Joseph, Owner of Cole’s Classroom [See Case Study](https://optinmonster.com/coles-classroom-added-55494-sales?utm_source=orgplugin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpreadme)

### Popup A/B Testing, Email Marketing Integrations, and Popup Analytics

Unlike other WordPress lead generation plugins, OptinMonster comes with reliable A/B split testing and accurate analytics without slowing down your site.

Most of them use wp-ajax to setup analytics. This slows down your site and also results in unreliable analytics due to cache plugin settings.

Similarly, A/B testing in a most WordPress popup plugins is broken because caching plugins can skew the data.

We fixed both these issues with our superior infrastructure, so you can have reliable A/B testing for popups, accurate conversion analytics, and seamless email marketing / CRM integrations for your marketing (bonus: lead storage & lead backup are included, too).

It needs a credit card for the free version and doesn’t tell you until the very end. I didn’t try it but that’s not how “freemium” should work.

This plugin requires a credit card, even for the “free” option. This is not disclosed anywhere until you activate and sign up. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

I have never used wordpress reviews but this trash plugin which requires a 3rd party signup and then a credit card information to get a free plan
and after all of these unnecessary steps their templates are not working and whenever you choose a template a completely different template shows up
what a waste of time !

Credit card required for free tariff, which is concealed until the last step of registration. Very bad practice.
