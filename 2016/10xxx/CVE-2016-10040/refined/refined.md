Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10040:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow in the `QXmlSimpleReader` class within the Qt library.
- The stack overflow is triggered by recursively parsing deeply nested XML opening tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack overflow:** The `parseElement()` and `parseContent()` functions call each other recursively, leading to stack exhaustion when processing deeply nested XML structures.
- **Lack of input validation:** The `QXmlSimpleReader` does not impose sufficient limits or checks on the depth of nested tags, allowing a malicious attacker to exhaust the stack.
- **Deprecated Class:** The documentation did not clearly state that the class `QXmlSimpleReader` was deprecated, leading developers to believe it was suitable for a wide range of applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  Exploiting this vulnerability results in a crash of the application using the `QXmlSimpleReader` library due to stack exhaustion.
- **Potential for other impacts:** Although not explicitly detailed, the vulnerability could potentially be used to corrupt data or perform other actions if the stack overflow could be exploited further (which is not likely on modern systems with stack protection).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XML input:** The primary attack vector is supplying the vulnerable application with a specially crafted XML file or stream with deeply nested opening tags.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with the malicious XML input. This could be through a network connection, a file upload, or other means of data input.

**Additional details:**
- Red Hat has marked the vulnerability as "WONTFIX" with low severity, as the affected class is deprecated and they do not intend to fix it. They advise using the `QXmlStreamReader` instead.
- The `QXmlSimpleReader` class documentation does not explicitly state the risks of processing untrusted XML input, leading to incorrect usage.
-  The `QString::resize()` function behavior on negative values was also reviewed as part of this analysis, but was found to behave as intended/documented.
