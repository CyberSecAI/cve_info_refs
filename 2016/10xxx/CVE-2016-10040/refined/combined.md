Hi Thiago,

Thank you for your helpful response.

Oh.  Is this stated somewhere in the documentation for QXmlSimpleReader,
along with the suggestion to use QXmlStreamReader instead?  Perhaps it
should be.

Right now, I see this:

<http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qxmlsimplereader.html#details>

"The QXmlSimpleReader class provides an implementation of a simple XML
parser.

This XML reader is suitable for a wide range of applications.  It is
able to parse well-formed XML and can report the namespaces of elements
to a content handler; however, it does not parse any external entities."

<http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qxmlstreamreader.html#details>

"The QXmlStreamReader class provides a fast parser for reading
well-formed XML via a simple streaming API.

QXmlStreamReader is a faster and more convenient replacement for Qt's
own SAX parser (see QXmlSimpleReader).  In some cases it might also be a
faster and more convenient alternative for use in applications that
would otherwise use a DOM tree"

This doesn't give the impression that either one is deprecated.  Also,
both say they're only for "well-formed" XML, suggesting they might be
unsuitable for use on untrusted input, but not explicitly stating so.
In fact, QXmlStreamReader has this "well-formed" requirement in the
one-sentence summary seen at top of page, whereas for QXmlSimpleReader
this requirement is only included in the details (second paragraph).

FYI, the stack overflow from recursive calls between parseElement() and
parseContent() got assigned CVE-2016-10040 here:

I see this is now documented:

<http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qstring.html#resize>

"If size is negative, it is equivalent to passing zero."

Either I overlooked this detail before, or you improved the
documentation since.

If I understand correctly, this means that in this piece I quoted before:

 8187 inline static void updateValue(QString &value, const QChar *array, int &arrayPos, int &valueLen)
 8188 {
 8189     value.resize(valueLen + arrayPos);
 8190     memcpy(value.data() + valueLen, array, arrayPos * sizeof(QChar));
 8191     valueLen += arrayPos;
 8192     arrayPos = 0;
 8193 }

it will be an up to 256 bytes write with the memcpy() at about 2 GiB
beyond the allocation, which value.resize() would reduce to 0 bytes.
(And if this somehow succeeds, then the second time it may be a similar
write at about 2 GiB below that allocation.)

Is this right?  Is it really that bad?

In general, are applications using Qt supposed to sanity-check the sizes
to be significantly below 2 GiB before passing such data on to Qt?

Thanks again,

Alexander

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

In case anyone immediately needs to track QXmlSimpleReader behavior,
we're assigning an ID for one issue that seems best understood at this
point:

> I just found that (at least for a rebuild of the RHEL7 package of
> qt-4.8.5-12) it is possible to trigger a stack overflow by nesting many
> XML opening tags. Luckily, there doesn't appear to be a way to jump
> over the guard page to another thread's stack on RHEL7/x86_64, but
> that's platform specific.

Use CVE-2016-10040.
