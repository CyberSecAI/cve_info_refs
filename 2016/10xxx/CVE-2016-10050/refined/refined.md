  "availabilityImpact": "LOW",
  "summary": "The vulnerability exists within the `ReadRLEImage` function in `coders/rle.c` of ImageMagick. When processing Run-Length Encoded (RLE) image files, a missing check on the pixel offset could lead to a heap overflow.",
  "details": [
    {
      "type": "Root cause",
      "content": "The root cause is a missing check for a negative pixel offset in the `ReadRLEImage` function within the `coders/rle.c` file. Specifically, when calculating the offset for pixels within the image data, a negative offset could be generated if the image dimensions or coordinates are manipulated maliciously, leading to out-of-bounds writes."
    },
    {
        "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities",
        "content": "The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. The absence of a check to ensure the calculated pixel offset is non-negative allows an attacker to write data outside the bounds of the allocated heap memory. The vulnerability exists in the handling of Run-Length Encoded (RLE) image data."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact of exploitation",
      "content": "Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to application crashes. Although not explicitly stated, arbitrary code execution is a potential impact if the heap overflow is carefully crafted."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack vectors",
       "content": "The primary attack vector involves providing a maliciously crafted RLE image file to an application or service using the vulnerable ImageMagick library. The application will then parse the file, leading to the vulnerability during the decoding process."
    },
    {
      "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
      "content": "An attacker must be able to provide a crafted RLE image file as input to a vulnerable application or service that uses the vulnerable ImageMagick library. The attacker does not need any specific system privileges or access to the target system."
    },
      {
      "type": "Additional Information",
      "content": "The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to ensure that the pixel offset is not less than zero. The fix is included in commit `73fb0aac5b958521e1511e179ecc0ad49f70ebaf`"
