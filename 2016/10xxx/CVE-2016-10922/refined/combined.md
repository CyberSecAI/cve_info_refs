One day I woke up to find 40,000 orders with payment pending, and more being created every second. After deactivating the responsible plugin, the next step was to clean up the orders. Just when I felt I needed a coffee to think through the steps and the SQL commands, I chanced upon this plugin that worked flawlessly. Many thanks to the team behind it!

I’ve been using this plugin for years, and, if it didn’t exist, I’d probably have to create it at least for my main uses – looking up custom field data on Users, Products, and Orders.
I’ll note that on a site with 150,000 customers and extensive custom user data, the plugin greatly slows down the backend, especially when opening up /wp-admin/users.php. I’ve had to resort to activating the plugin only when debugging particular issues, and have to remind myself to de-activate it every time I’m done with whichever particular task, to avoid inconveniencing other people working on the site (and to avoid inconveniencing myself if I forget it’s on).
So, in short, a simple on/off button at least, maybe some work on speeding things up, would be welcome, but I wouldn’t hold this issue against the developers of such a useful free plugin.
