  "CVE-2016-10166": {
    "description": "A potential unsigned integer underflow vulnerability was found in the _gdContributionsAlloc function in libgd.  This issue can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow if an attacker provides a crafted image.",
    "affected_component": "gd library",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `_gdContributionsAlloc` function where an unsigned integer underflow can occur, resulting in a small allocation size.",
        "vulnerability": "Unsigned integer underflow, resulting in a heap based buffer overflow",
     "impact": "Heap-based buffer overflow. Can result in a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution via specially crafted images.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can exploit this by providing crafted image data that triggers the vulnerable code path.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger the image processing with the crafted image.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerable `_gdContributionsAlloc` function was first introduced in gd 2.1.0 and the issue was fixed in gd 2.2.4.  The vulnerable code was added to PHP in 5.5.0."
