The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10122.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Firejail application did not properly clean the environment before executing a program as root, particularly when using the `--x11` flag which starts an X server as root, allowing the attacker to control environment variables including `LD_PRELOAD`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is present because the environment variables, such as `LD_PRELOAD`, were not sanitized before the execution of a program as root. This allowed an attacker to inject a shared object that would be loaded before any other libraries, giving them full control over the process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A non-privileged user could escalate to root privileges by injecting malicious code through the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable when Firejail executes an X server as root. This would allow complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves using the `--x11` and `--env` flags. The attacker can set `LD_PRELOAD` to point to a malicious shared object, which will be loaded when Firejail executes the X server as root.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on a system with Firejail installed. The attacker can craft a malicious shared object and has to have the ability to execute the Firejail program with the vulnerable flags.
