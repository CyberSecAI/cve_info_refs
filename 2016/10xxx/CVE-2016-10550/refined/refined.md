The provided content is related to CVE-2016-10550.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of `limit` and `order by` arguments in the Sequelize library, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code was not escaping user-provided input when constructing SQL queries, specifically in the `limit` and `order by` clauses, which allowed for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `limit` or `order by` parameters of a query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the input used for the `limit` or `order by` parameters in a Sequelize query.
