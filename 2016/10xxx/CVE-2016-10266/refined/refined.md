Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `TIFFReadEncodedStrip()` function within `libtiff/tif_read.c`. Specifically, the calculation of `stripsperplane` could overflow, leading to an integer division by zero later in the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The `stripsperplane` calculation using `(td->td_imagelength+rowsperstrip-1)/rowsperstrip` is susceptible to integer overflow when `td->td_imagelength` and `rowsperstrip` are large.
- Division by Zero: A subsequent division by `stripsperplane` when `stripsperplane` overflows to zero causes a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The immediate impact is a crash due to the division-by-zero error. This can lead to a denial of service for applications that use the libtiff library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious TIFF Image: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image file.
- File Processing: The attack vector involves processing a malicious file using tools or libraries using libtiff that call `TIFFReadEncodedStrip()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify a TIFF image file with specific characteristics that cause the integer overflow during calculations.
- The attacker must be able to get the vulnerable software to process the crafted TIFF image.
- No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as it's triggered during the normal image processing workflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves using the `TIFFhowmany_32_maxuint_compat` macro which handles large values to compute the number of strips per plane without overflows.
- The vulnerability was reported by Agostino Sarubbo.
- The vulnerability is fixed by commit [438274f938e046d33cb0e1230b41da32ffe223e1](https://github.com/vadz/libtiff/commit/438274f938e046d33cb0e1230b41da32ffe223e1)
