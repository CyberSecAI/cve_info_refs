## Description

[![@leibale](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7086055?v=4&size=48)](/leibale)[leibale](https://github.com/leibale)opened [on Mar 29, 2016](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5671#issue-144246027)

i'm using mssql.

sequelize version is 3.19.3.

sample:

```
const Sequelize = require('sequelize'),
    database = new Sequelize( ... );

database.query('SELECT * FROM Table WHERE Id IN (:ids)', {
  replacements: {
    ids: [1, 2, 3, "'asdf"]
  }
}).catch(function (err) {
  // got sql syntax error
});
```

because `tedious` doesn't support arrays as parameters you must add a parameter for every item in the array and use it in the query (`IN (:ids0, :ids1, :ids2, :ids3)`).

now there is an option to do sql injection.
