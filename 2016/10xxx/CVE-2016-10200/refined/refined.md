    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel which enables a race condition in the L2TPv3 IP Encapsulation feature. A local user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges or crash the system.",

      "Root cause": "Race condition in the L2TPv3 IP encapsulation feature, specifically during the handling of socket flags.",
      "Weaknesses": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper locking and flag checks.",
      "Impact": "Local privilege escalation or system crash (denial of service).",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by a user capable of making multiple bind system calls to L2TP sockets.",
