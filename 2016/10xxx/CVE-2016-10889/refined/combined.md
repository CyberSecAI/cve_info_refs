## FAQ

### Why are my photo galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site?

This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: [Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?](https://www.imagely.com/docs/galleries-opening-lightbox/).

### Do you have documentation or tutorials?

Yes. See [NextGEN Gallery Documentation](https://www.imagely.com/docs/).

### Will this gallery plugin work with my theme?

Yup, NextGEN is a popular and well-established WordPress gallery plugin, and has been for a long time. It will work well with most other themes and plugins in the WordPress ecosystem.

### Are the photo galleries flash based?

Nope, we do not use flash elements.

### Are the galleries mobile friendly?

Yes, we’ve put a lot of work into this and, NextGEN Galleries are compatible with phones and tablets, inluding Android and iOS operating systems. All photo galleries are also responsive, so galleries look good on diverse screen sizes. NextGEN Pro also includes a fullscreen, responsive Pro Lightbox with mobile gesture support. It’s great for viewing photos on mobile devices.

### What is the difference between a gallery and an album?

In simple terms, Albums are collections of galleries. So Galleries contain your photos and Albums contain your Galleries. Albums act as links and placeholders to quickly and easily navigate your galleries. Galleries will actually display your images.

### Can I upload multiple images at once?

Yes, you can batch upload entire photo galleries at one time or even include zip folders.

### Can I password protect galleries?

Yes, WordPress allows you to password protect pages by default – which includes all photo galleries and content for the entire page. Password protection pages can be turned on and off at any time, with just a few clicks.

Yes, you can add text or image watermarks to your gallery images.

### Can I crop photo thumbnails?

Yes, each thumbnail image can be individually adjusted to suit your needs.

### Is there pagination for photo galleries?

Yes, you can use pagination when displaying thumbnail galleries. You can adjust the amount of photos to be shown on a page at any time.

### Can I customize the lightbox?

Yes, the lightbox can be configured with multiple options directly from the Dashboard, and there are multiple CSS styles, which can be applied and modified as well. If you want even more options, consider upgrading to NextGEN Pro and using the NextGEN Pro lightbox.

### Can I add HTML to photo captions?

Yes, caption areas are fully HMTL capable.

### Can I add an external links to galleries?

Since the captions are fully HTML capable, you can add external links and any other type of markup you wish.

### Is NextGEN Gallery available in foreign languages?

Some functions are difficult to find, especially when you don’t use the plugin frequently, such as find the code of a gallery to be inserted in the page, or add photos toan existing gallery.Nevertheless, the app remains easy to use.

I’ve been using it to share high quality pictures of our work on our website and it’s been great because it doesn’t make the page boggy and slow to load. Definitely recommend.

After bouncing around looking for THE plugin for my photography, I came across this. It was straightforward to configure and I received immediate help when I had a couple of snags when configuring checkout. I’d love to see a few enhancements to the pricelist end of things and also preventing an order to go straight to a lab without approval and replacement of an image. I am also planning on setting this plugin up on another website I maintain. The search by tag is fantastic and very useful for photography groups that have competitions.
