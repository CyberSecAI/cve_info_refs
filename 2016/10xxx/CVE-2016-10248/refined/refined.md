  "CVE-2016-10248": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for an empty sequence in the jpc_tsfb_synthesize function, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "Null Pointer Dereference"
        ],
      "Impact": "A specially crafted JPEG-2000 image could cause an application using JasPer to crash. In some cases this could also lead to code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": "By providing a malformed JPEG-2000 image file to a user or automated system using JasPer.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted image file."
    },
     "Affected Versions":{
      "Affected": [
        "jasper prior to 1.900.9",
        "Ubuntu 16.04 ESM",
        "Ubuntu 14.04 ESM",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7"
          ],
      "Fixed": [
         "jasper 1.900.9",
         "libjasper1 1.900.1-debian1-2.4ubuntu1.2 (Ubuntu 16.04)",
         "libjasper1 1.900.1-14ubuntu3.5 (Ubuntu 14.04)",
          "jasper-1.900.1-30.el7_3 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
           "jasper-1.900.1-21.el6_9 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
         ]
    },
    "Additional Information": {
     "Fix Details": "The fix involves modifying the jpc_tsfb_synthesize function to be a noop for an empty sequence, thus avoiding the dereferencing of a null pointer. A JAS_CAST was also added to jpc_dec_c.",
      "Notes": "The issue was discovered through fuzzing.  The vulnerability was fixed in Jasper version 1.900.9. The impact of the flaw is limited to application crash. There was no plan to backport the fix to released Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions initially, but a fix was later issued.",
        "Patch Link": "https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/commit/2e82fa00466ae525339754bb3ab0a0474a31d4bd"
