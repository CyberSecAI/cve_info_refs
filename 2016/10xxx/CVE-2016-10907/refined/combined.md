libnvdimm: clear the internal poison\_list when clearing badblocks
commit e046114af5fcafe8d6d3f0b6ccb99804bad34bfb upstream.
nvdimm\_clear\_poison cleared the user-visible badblocks, and sent
commands to the NVDIMM to clear the areas marked as 'poison', but it
neglected to clear the same areas from the internal poison\_list which is
used to marshal ARS results before sorting them by namespace. As a
result, once on-demand ARS functionality was added:
37b137f nfit, libnvdimm: allow an ARS scrub to be triggered on demand
A scrub triggered from either sysfs or an MCE was found to be adding
stale entries that had been cleared from gendisk->badblocks, but were
still present in nvdimm\_bus->poison\_list. Additionally, the stale entries
could be triggered into producing stale disk->badblocks by simply disabling
and re-enabling the namespace or region.
This adds the missing step of clearing poison\_list entries when clearing
poison, so that it is always in sync with badblocks.

PCI: tegra: Fix pci\_remap\_iospace() failure path
commit 13f392ebc37e31568fae72a73ee378ae22a9740f upstream.
On ARM/ARM64 architectures, PCI IO ports are emulated through memory mapped
IO, by reserving a chunk of virtual address space starting at PCI\_IOBASE
and by mapping the PCI host bridges memory address space driving PCI IO
cycles to it.
PCI host bridge drivers that enable downstream PCI IO cycles map the host
bridge memory address responding to PCI IO cycles to the fixed virtual
address space through the pci\_remap\_iospace() API.
This means that if the pci\_remap\_iospace() function fails, the
corresponding host bridge PCI IO resource must be considered invalid, in
that there is no way for the kernel to actually drive PCI IO transactions
if the memory addresses responding to PCI IO cycles cannot be mapped into
the CPU virtual address space.
The PCI tegra host bridge driver adds the PCI IO resource retrieved from
firmware to the host bridge resource windows even if the
pci\_remap\_iospace() call fails; this is an actual bug in that the PCI host
bridge would consider the PCI IO resource valid (and possibly assign it to
downstream devices) even if the kernel was not able to map the PCI host
bridge memory address driving IO cycle to the CPU virtual address space (ie
pci\_remap\_iospace() failures).
Add the PCI host bridge driver pci\_remap\_iospace() failure path and do not
add the corresponding PCI host bridge PCI IO resources retrieved through
firmware when the pci\_remap\_iospace() function call fails, fixing the
issue.

Commit b8d368caa8dc ("ARM: dts: omap3: overo: remove unneded unit names

that didn't have a reg property.
But the display in arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-overo-common-lcd35.dtsi does
have a reg property so the correct fix was to make the unit name match
the value of the reg property, instead of removing it.
This patch fixes the following DTC warning for boards using this dtsi:
"ocp/spi@48098000/display has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name"

ARM: pxa: fix GPIO double shifts
commit ca26475bf02ed8562b9b46f91d3e8b52ec312541 upstream.
The commit 9bf448c66d4b ("ARM: pxa: use generic gpio operation instead of
gpio register") from Oct 17, 2011, leads to the following static checker
warning:
arch/arm/mach-pxa/spitz\_pm.c:172 spitz\_charger\_wakeup()
warn: double left shift '!gpio\_get\_value(SPITZ\_GPIO\_KEY\_INT)
<< (1 << ((SPITZ\_GPIO\_KEY\_INT) & 31))'
As Dan reported, the value is shifted three times :
- once by gpio\_get\_value(), which returns either 0 or BIT(gpio)
- once by the shift operation '<<'
- a last time by GPIO\_bit(gpio) which is BIT(gpio)
Therefore the calculation lead to a chained or operator of :
- (1 << gpio) << (1 << gpio) = (2^gpio)^gpio = 2 ^ (gpio \* gpio)
It is be sheer luck the former statement works, only because each gpio
used is strictly smaller than 6, and therefore 2^(gpio^2) never
overflows a 32 bits value, and because it is used as a boolean value to
check a gpio activation.
As the xxx\_charger\_wakeup() functions are used as a true/false detection
mechanism, take that opportunity to change their prototypes from integer
return value to boolean one.

ARM: pxa: pxa\_cplds: fix interrupt handling
commit 9ba63e3cc849cdaf3b675c47cc51fe35419e5117 upstream.
Since its initial commit, the driver is buggy for multiple interrupts
handling. The translation from the former lubbock.c file was not
complete, and might stall all interrupt handling when multiple
interrupts occur.
This is especially true when inside the interrupt handler and if a new
interrupt comes and is not handled, leaving the output line still held,
and not creating a transition as the GPIO block behind would expect to
trigger another cplds\_irq\_handler() call.
For the record, the hardware is working as follows.
The interrupt mechanism relies on :
- one status register
- one mask register
Let's suppose the input irq lines are called :
- i\_sa1111
- i\_lan91x
- i\_mmc\_cd
Let's suppose the status register for each irq line is called :
- status\_sa1111
- status\_lan91x
- status\_mmc\_cd
Let's suppose the interrupt mask for each irq line is called :
- irqen\_sa1111
- irqen\_lan91x
- irqen\_mmc\_cd
Let's suppose the output irq line, connected to GPIO0 is called :
- o\_gpio0
The behavior is as follows :
- o\_gpio0 = not((status\_sa1111 & irqen\_sa1111) |
(status\_lan91x & irqen\_lan91x) |
(status\_mmc\_cd & irqen\_mmc\_cd))
=> this is a N-to-1 NOR gate and multiple AND gates
- irqen\_\* is exactly as programmed by a write to the FPGA
- status\_\* behavior is governed by a bi-stable D flip-flop
=> on next FPGA clock :
- if i\_xxx is high, status\_xxx becomes 1
- if i\_xxx is low, status\_xxx remains as it is
- if software sets status\_xxx to 0, the D flip-flop is reset
=> status\_xxx becomes 0
=> on next FPGA clock cycle, if i\_xxx is high, status\_xxx becomes
1 again

commit b0f16b46988fde02a1e32078f66a3059d7e53bfc upstream.
giveup\_all() causes FPU/VMX/VSX facilities to be disabled in a threads

must record which facilities were in use before the giveup as the
thread must have these facilities re-enabled on return to userspace.

powerpc: Always restore FPU/VEC/VSX if hardware transactional memory in use
commit dc16b553c949e81f37555777dc7bab66d78285a7 upstream.
Comment from arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:967:
If userspace is inside a transaction (whether active or
suspended) and FP/VMX/VSX instructions have ever been enabled
inside that transaction, then we have to keep them enabled
and keep the FP/VMX/VSX state loaded while ever the transaction
continues. The reason is that if we didn't, and subsequently
got a FP/VMX/VSX unavailable interrupt inside a transaction,
we don't know whether it's the same transaction, and thus we
don't know which of the checkpointed state and the ransactional
state to use.
restore\_math() restore\_fp() and restore\_altivec() currently may not
restore the registers. It doesn't appear that this is more serious
than a performance penalty. If the math registers aren't restored the
userspace thread will still be run with the facility disabled.
Userspace will not be able to read invalid values. On the first access
it will take an facility unavailable exception and the kernel will
detected an active transaction, at which point it will abort the
transaction. There is the possibility for a pathological case
preventing any progress by transactions, however, transactions
are never guaranteed to make progress.

commit 06ad11be7a9e13499ff8e55e46f09d22f9ee6fc0 upstream.
The R\_PIO device node is missing #interrupt-cells, which causes
interrupt parsing to fail to match it as a valid interrupt controller.
Add #interrupt-cells to it. Also remove the unnecesary #address-cells

We were assigning the return value of iwl\_mvm\_ctdp\_command() to a

iwlwifi: mvm: call a different txq\_enable function
commit ca3b9c6b6d4db9a8ba5fc8b95664e75468c59f9f upstream.
Since the SCD\_QUEUE\_CFG command was introduced the driver
calls iwl\_trans\_txq\_enable\_cfg() with a NULL for scd\_cfg
parameter.
This makes the transport avoid writing to the SCD pointers,
since it can cause races with firmware, which is also accessing
the registers.
The transport only updates the write pointer in that case.
Fix a wrong call to iwl\_trans\_txq\_enable() which caused a
scd\_cfg parameter to be sent to transport, resulting with an
access to SCD registers.

perf symbols: Fixup symbol sizes before picking best ones
commit 432746f8e0b6a82ba832b771afe31abd51af6752 upstream.
When we call symbol\_\_fixup\_duplicate() we use algorithms to pick the
"best" symbols for cases where there are various functions/aliases to an
address, and those check zero size symbols, which, before calling
symbol\_\_fixup\_end() are \_all\_ symbols in a just parsed kallsyms file.
So first fixup the end, then fixup the duplicates.
Found while trying to figure out why 'perf test vmlinux' failed, see the
output of 'perf test -v vmlinux' to see cases where the symbols picked
as best for vmlinux don't match the ones picked for kallsyms.

I bisected it and found it's failing from commit ad430729ae00 ("Remove:

Header file '../../arch/powerpc/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h' is included
only for powerpc in tools/perf/perf-sys.h.
By looking closly at commit history, I found little weird thing:
Commit f2d9cae9ea9e ("perf powerpc: Use uapi/unistd.h to fix build
error") replaced 'asm/unistd.h' with 'uapi/asm/unistd.h'
Commit d2709c7ce4c5 ("perf: Make perf build for x86 with UAPI

for all archs and adds generic .
Commit f0b9abfb0446 ("Merge branch 'linus' into perf/core") again
includes 'uapi/asm/unistd.h' for powerpc. Don't know how exactly this
happened as this change is not part of commit also.

perf hists browser: Fix event group display
commit d9ea48bc4e7cc297ca1073fa3f90ed80d964b7b4 upstream.
Milian reported that the event group on TUI shows duplicated overhead.
This was due to a bug on calculating hpp->buf position. The
hpp\_advance() was called from \_\_hpp\_\_slsmg\_color\_printf() on TUI but
it's already called from the hpp\_\_call\_print\_fn macro in \_\_hpp\_\_fmt().
The end result is that the print function returns number of bytes it
printed but the buffer advanced twice of the length.
This is generally not a problem since it doesn't need to access the
buffer again. But with event group, overhead needs to be printed
multiple times and hist\_entry\_\_snprintf\_alignment() tries to fill the
space with buffer after it printed. So it (brokenly) showed the last
overhead again.
The bug was there from the beginning, but I think it's only revealed
when the alignment function was added.

clk: Return errors from clk providers in \_\_of\_clk\_get\_from\_provider()
commit f155d15b64e36b45ca89e3521fe0c1ccad5e5ff0 upstream.
Before commit 0861e5b8cf80 (clk: Add clk\_hw OF clk providers,
2016-02-05) \_\_of\_clk\_get\_from\_provider() would return an error
pointer of the provider's choosing if there was a provider
registered and EPROBE\_DEFER otherwise. After that commit, it
would return EPROBE\_DEFER regardless of whether or not the
provider returned an error. This is odd and can lead to behavior
where clk consumers keep probe deferring when they should be
seeing some other error.
Let's restore the previous behavior where we only return
EPROBE\_DEFER when there isn't a provider in our of\_clk\_providers
list. Otherwise, return the error from the last provider we find
that matches the node.

clk: bcm2835: Skip PLLC clocks when deciding on a new clock parent
commit 67615c588a059b731df9d019edc3c561d8006ec9 upstream.
If the firmware had set up a clock to source from PLLC, go along with
it. But if we're looking for a new parent, we don't want to switch it
to PLLC because the firmware will force PLLC (and thus the AXI bus
clock) to different frequencies during over-temp/under-voltage,
without notification to Linux.
On my system, this moves the Linux-enabled HDMI state machine and DSI1
escape clock over to plld\_per from pllc\_per. EMMC still ends up on
pllc\_per, because the firmware had set it up to use that.

s390/con3270: fix insufficient space padding
commit 6cd997db911f28f2510b771691270c52b63ed2e6 upstream.
con3270 contains an optimisation that reduces the amount of data to be
transmitted to the 3270 terminal by putting a Repeat to Address (RA)
order into the data stream. The RA order itself takes up space, so
con3270 only uses it if there's enough space left in the line
buffer. Otherwise it just pads out the line manually.
For lines that were \_just\_ short enough that the RA order still fit in
the line buffer, the line was instead padded with an insufficient
amount of spaces. This was caused by examining the size of the
allocated line buffer rather than the length of the string to be
displayed.
For con3270\_cline\_end(), we just compare against the line length. For
con3270\_update\_string() however that isn't available anymore, so we
check whether the Repeat to Address order is present.

s390/con3270: fix use of uninitialised data
commit c14f2aac7aa147861793eed9f41f91dd530f0be1 upstream.
con3270 contains an optimisation that reduces the amount of data to be
transmitted to the 3270 terminal by putting a Repeat to Address (RA)
order into the data stream. The RA order itself takes up space, so
con3270 only uses it if there's enough space left in the line
buffer. Otherwise it just pads out the line manually.
For lines too long to include the RA order, one byte was left
uninitialised. This was caused by an off-by-one bug in the loop that
pads out the line. Since the buffer is allocated from a common pool,
the single byte left uninitialised contained some previous buffer
content. Usually this was just a space or some character (which can
result in clutter but is otherwise harmless). Sometimes, however, it
was a Repeat to Address order, messing up the entire screen layout and
causing the display to send the entire buffer content on every
keystroke.

s390/cio: fix accidental interrupt enabling during resume
commit d53c51f26145657aa7c55fa396f93677e613548d upstream.
Since commit 9f3d6d7 chsc\_get\_channel\_measurement\_chars is called with
interrupts disabled during resume from hibernate. Since this function
used spin\_unlock\_irq, interrupts have been enabled accidentally. Fix
this by using the irqsave variant.
Since we can't guarantee the IRQ-enablement state for all (future/
external) callers, change the locking in related functions to prevent
similar bugs in the future.

drm/vmwgfx: Avoid validating views on view destruction
commit a19440304db2d97aed5cee9bfa5017c98d2348bf upstream.
When a view destruction command was present in the command stream, the
view was validated to avoid a device error. That caused excessive and
unnecessary validations of views, surfaces and mobs on view destruction.
Replace this with a new relocation type that patches the view
destruction command to a NOP if the view is not present in the device
after the execbuf validation sequence.
Also add checks for the member size of the vmw\_res\_relocation struct.
Fixes sporadic command submission errors on google-earth exit.

mm/hugetlb: improve locking in dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages()
commit eb03aa008561004257900983193d024e57abdd96 upstream.
For every pfn aligned to minimum\_order, dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages() will
call dissolve\_free\_huge\_page() which takes the hugetlb spinlock, even if
the page is not huge at all or a hugepage that is in-use.
Improve this by doing the PageHuge() and page\_count() checks already in
dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages() before calling dissolve\_free\_huge\_page(). In
dissolve\_free\_huge\_page(), when holding the spinlock, those checks need
to be revalidated.

mm/hugetlb: check for reserved hugepages during memory offline
commit 082d5b6b60e9f25e1511557fcfcb21eedd267446 upstream.
In dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages(), free hugepages will be dissolved without
making sure that there are enough of them left to satisfy hugepage
reservations.
Fix this by adding a return value to dissolve\_free\_huge\_pages() and
checking h->free\_huge\_pages vs. h->resv\_huge\_pages. Note that this may
lead to the situation where dissolve\_free\_huge\_page() returns an error
and all free hugepages that were dissolved before that error are lost,
while the memory block still cannot be set offline.

commit 86c7e6836479c4045a9a81ed5ea76c51d719f9c1 upstream.
A workaround for a warning introduced a use of the NO\_IRQ
macro that should have been gone for a long time.
It is clear from the code that the value cannot actually
be used, but apparently there was a configuration at
some point that caused a warning, so instead of just
reverting that patch, this rearranges the code in a way that

commit 01ad5e7de67b408d9b48b437b06a9938ddf460b5 upstream.
If soc\_dapm\_read() fails, val will be uninitialized, and bogus values
will be written later:
ret = soc\_dapm\_read(dapm, reg, &val);
val = (val >> shift) & mask;
However, the compiler does not give a warning. Return on error before
val is really used to avoid this.
This is similar to the commit 6912831623c5 ("ASoC: dapm: Fix
uninitialized variable in snd\_soc\_dapm\_get\_enum\_double()")

hwrng: omap - Only fail if pm\_runtime\_get\_sync returns < 0
commit ad8529fde9e3601180a839867a8ab041109aebb5 upstream.
Currently omap-rng checks the return value of pm\_runtime\_get\_sync and
reports failure if anything is returned, however it should be checking
if ret < 0 as pm\_runtime\_get\_sync return 0 on success but also can return
1 if the device was already active which is not a failure case. Only
values < 0 are actual failures.

crypto: marvell - Update transformation context for each dequeued req
commit 09951d83fc58a6f772de09c08e370f6d9970dbb6 upstream.
So far, sub part of mv\_cesa\_int was responsible of dequeuing complete
requests, then call the 'cleanup' operation on these reqs and call the
crypto api callback 'complete'. The problem is that the transformation
context 'ctx' is retrieved only once before the while loop. Which means
that the wrong 'cleanup' operation might be called on the wrong type of
cesa requests, it can lead to memory corruptions with this message:
marvell-cesa f1090000.crypto: dma\_pool\_free cesa\_padding, 5a5a5a5a/5a5a5a5a (bad dma)

commit 50d2e6dc1f83db0563c7d6603967bf9585ce934b upstream.
The cipher block size for GCM is 16 bytes, and thus the CTR transform
used in crypto\_gcm\_setkey() will also expect a 16-byte IV. However,
the code currently reserves only 8 bytes for the IV, causing
an out-of-bounds access in the CTR transform. This patch fixes
the issue by setting the size of the IV buffer to 16 bytes.

crypto: marvell - Don't overwrite default creq->state during initialization
commit 57cfda1ac74e58767f6305bd1ea3449177425460 upstream.
Currently, in mv\_cesa\_{md5,sha1,sha256}\_init creq->state is initialized
before the call to mv\_cesa\_ahash\_init. This is wrong because this
function fills creq with zero by using memset, so its 'state' that
contains the default DIGEST is overwritten. This commit fixes the issue
by initializing creq->state just after the call to mv\_cesa\_ahash\_init.

ath10k: fix throughput regression in multi client mode
commit 18f53fe0f30331e826b075709ed7b26b9283235e upstream.
commit 7a0adc83f34d ("ath10k: improve tx scheduling") is causing
severe throughput drop in multi client mode. This issue is originally
reported in veriwave setup with 50 clients with TCP downlink traffic.
While increasing number of clients, the average throughput drops
gradually. With 50 clients, the combined peak throughput is decreased
to 98 Mbps whereas reverting given commit restored it to 550 Mbps.
Processing txqs for every tx completion is causing overhead. Ideally for
management frame tx completion, pending txqs processing can be avoided.
The change partly reverts the commit "ath10k: improve tx scheduling".
Processing pending txqs after all skbs tx completion will yeild enough
room to burst tx frames.

ath10k: fix sending frame in management path in push txq logic
commit e4fd726f21cdae0dc9cea6cbfcb7e27f21393f88 upstream.
In the wake tx queue path, we are not checking if the frame to be sent
takes management path or not. For eg. QOS null func frame coming here will
take the management path. Since we are not incrementing the descriptor
counter (num\_pending\_mgmt\_tx) w.r.t tx management, on tx completion it is
possible to see negative values.
When the above counter reaches a negative value, we will not be sending a
probe response out.
if (is\_presp &&
ar->hw\_params.max\_probe\_resp\_desc\_thres < htt->num\_pending\_mgmt\_tx)
For IPQ4019, max\_probe\_resp\_desc\_thres (u32) is 24 is compared against
num\_pending\_mgmt\_tx (int) and the above condtions comes true if the counter
is negative and we drop the probe response.
To avoid this, check on the wake tx queue path as well for the tx path of
the frame and increment the appropriate counters

The variable i contains a total number of resources (including
IORESOURCE\_IRQ). However, we want the dmem\_region\_start to point
after the last resource of type IORESOURCE\_MEM. The original behaviour
leads (very likely) to skipping several UIO mapping regions and makes
them useless. Fix this by computing dmem\_region\_start from the uiomem
which points to the last used UIO mapping.

tmc\_probe. However it failed to remove the "devm\_free\_coherent" in
tmc\_probe when the probe fails due to other reasons. This patch gets
rid of the incorrect dma\_free\_coherent() call.

genirq/generic\_chip: Add irq\_unmap callback
commit ee26c013cdee0b947e29d6cadfb9ff3341c69ff9 upstream.
Without this patch irq\_domain\_disassociate() cannot properly release the
interrupt. In fact, irq\_map\_generic\_chip() checks a bit on 'gc->installed'
but said bit is never cleared, only set.
Commit 088f40b7b027 ("genirq: Generic chip: Add linear irq domain support")
added irq\_map\_generic\_chip() function and also stated "This lacks a removal
function for now".
This commit provides an implementation of an unmap function that can be
called by irq\_domain\_disassociate().
[ tglx: Made the function static and removed the export as we have neither
a prototype nor a modular user. ]

scsi: cxlflash: Remove the device cleanly in the system shutdown path
commit babf985d1e1b0677cb264acd01319d2b9c8f4327 upstream.
Commit 704c4b0ddc03 ("cxlflash: Shutdown notify support for CXL Flash
cards") was recently introduced to notify the AFU when a system is going
down. Due to the position of the cxlflash driver in the device stack,
cxlflash devices are \_always\_ removed during a reboot/shutdown. This can
lead to a crash if the cxlflash shutdown hook is invoked \_after\_ the
shutdown hook for the owning virtual PHB. Furthermore, the current
implementation of shutdown/remove hooks for cxlflash are not tolerant to
being invoked when the device is not enabled. This can also lead to a
crash in situations where the remove hook is invoked after the device
has been removed via the vPHBs shutdown hook. An example of this
scenario would be an EEH reset failure while a reboot/shutdown is in
progress.
To solve both problems, the shutdown hook for cxlflash is updated to
simply remove the device. This path already includes the AFU
notification and thus this solution will continue to perform the
original intent. At the same time, the remove hook is updated to protect
against being called when the device is not enabled.

posix\_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
commit 073931017b49d9458aa351605b43a7e34598caef upstream.
When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
the owning group or capable of CAP\_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
inode\_change\_ok(). Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2). Fix that.

We can't rely on connector->status in the detect() hook if the long hpd
was already handled by the dig\_port\_work as that won't update
connector->status. Thus we have to defer the long hpd handling entirely

drm/i915: Allow PCH DPLL sharing regardless of DPLL\_SDVO\_HIGH\_SPEED
commit a3fd4c67af3d8a81d241b3d51b3525f36f1d68bb upstream.
DPLL\_SDVO\_HIGH\_SPEED must be set for SDVO/HDMI/DP, but nowhere is it
forbidden to set it for LVDS/CRT as well. So let's also set it on
CRT to make it possible to share the DPLL between HDMI and CRT.
What that bit apparently does is enable the x5 clock to the port,
which then pumps out the bits on both edges of the clock. The DAC
doesn't need that clock since it's not pumping out bits, but I don't
think it hurts to have the DPLL output that clock anyway.
This is fairly important on IVB since it has only two DPLLs with three
pipes. So trying to drive three or more PCH ports with three pipes
is only possible when at least one of the DPLLs gets shared between
two of the pipes.
SNB doesn't really need to do this since it has only two pipes. It could
be done to avoid enabling the second DPLL at all in certain cases, but
I'm not sure that's such a huge win. So let's not do it for SNB, at
least for now. On ILK it never makes sense as the DPLLs can't be shared.
v2: Just always enable the high speed clock to keep things simple (Daniel)

drm/i915: Account for TSEG size when determining 865G stolen base
commit d721b02fd00bf133580f431b82ef37f3b746dfb2 upstream.
Looks like the TSEG lives just above TOUD, stolen comes after TSEG.
The spec seems somewhat self-contradictory in places, in the ESMRAMC
register desctription it says:
TSEG Size:
10=(TOUD + 512 KB) to TOUD
11 =(TOUD + 1 MB) to TOUD
so that agrees with TSEG being at TOUD. But the example given
elsehwere in the spec says:
TOUD equals 62.5 MB = 03E7FFFFh
TSEG selected as 512 KB in size,
Graphics local memory selected as 1 MB in size
General System RAM available in system = 62.5 MB
General system RAM range00000000h to 03E7FFFFh
TSEG address range03F80000h to 03FFFFFFh
TSEG pre-allocated from03F80000h to 03FFFFFFh
Graphics local memory pre-allocated from03E80000h to 03F7FFFFh
so here we have TSEG above stolen.
Real world evidence agrees with the TOUD->TSEG->stolen order however, so
let's fix up the code to account for the TSEG size.

Revert "drm/i915: Check live status before reading edid"
commit 23f889bdf6ee5cfff012d8b09f6bec920c691696 upstream.
This reverts commit 237ed86c693d8a8e4db476976aeb30df4deac74b.
Our current implementation of live status check (repeat 9 times
with 10ms delays between each attempt as a workaround for
buggy displays) imposes a rather serious penalty, time wise,
on intel\_hdmi\_detect(). Since we we already skip live status
checks on platforms before gen 7, and since we seem to have
coped quite well before the live status check was introduced
for newer platforms too, the previous behaviour is probably
preferable, at least unless someone can point to a use-case
that the live status check improves (apart from "Bspec says so".)

I thought about keeping the functions with their current skl names,

calling any functions whose name start with a platform name, so the
"intel\_" naming scheme seems make more sense than the "firstplatorm\_"

drm/i915/gen9: fix plane\_blocks\_per\_line on watermarks calculations
commit cf6c525a31fac11b0775b8c06c00a508c6356d9b upstream.
The confusing thing is that plane\_blocks\_per\_line is listed as part of
the method 2 calculation but is also used for other things. We
calculated it in two different places and different ways: one inside
skl\_wm\_method2() and the other inside skl\_compute\_plane\_wm(). The
skl\_wm\_method2() implementation is the one that matches the
specification.
With this patch we fix the skl\_compute\_plane\_wm() calculation and just
pass it as a parameter to skl\_wm\_method2(). We also take care to not
modify the value of plane\_bytes\_per\_line since we're going to rely on
it having a correct value in later patches.
This should affect the watermarks for Linear and Y-tiled.
From my analysis, it looks like the two plane\_blocks\_per\_line
variables got out of sync on 0fda65680e92, but we can't really say
that commit was a regression, it looks like just an incomplete fix.
There's always the possibility that 0fda65680e92 matched our
specification at that time, and then later the specification changed.

drm/i915/gen9: fix the WaWmMemoryReadLatency implementation
commit 4e4d3814a9bb4d71cd3ff0701d8d7041edefd8f0 upstream.
Bspec says:
"The mailbox response data may not account for memory read latency.
If the mailbox response data for level 0 is 0us, add 2 microseconds
to the result for each valid level."
This means we should only do the +2 in case wm[0] == 0, not always.
So split the sanitizing implementation from the WA implementation and
fix the WA implementation.
v2: Add Fixes tag (Maarten).

drm/i915/gen9: only add the planes actually affected by ddb changes
commit be5c571b2ff3a164d2e14ccc100cb5b2b3d3fb7c upstream.
We were previously adding all the planes owned by the CRTC even when
the ddb partitioning didn't change for them. As a consequence, a lot
of functions were being called when we were just moving the cursor
around the screen, such as skylake\_update\_primary\_plane().
This was causing flickering on the primary plane when moving the
cursor. I'm not 100% sure which operation caused the flickering, but
we were writing to a lot of registers, so it could be any of these
writes. With this patch, just moving the mouse won't add the primary
plane to the commit since it won't trigger a change in DDB
partitioning.
v2: Use skl\_ddb\_entry\_equal() (Lyude).

drm/i915/skl: Don't try to update plane watermarks if they haven't changed
commit ccebc23b57c313229526dc76383ce82f5e0b9001 upstream.
i915 sometimes needs to disable planes in the middle of an atomic
commit, and then reenable them later in the same commit. Because of
this, we can't make the assumption that the state of the plane actually
changed. Since the state of the plane hasn't actually changed, neither
have it's watermarks. And if the watermarks hasn't changed then we
haven't populated skl\_results with anything, which means we'll end up
zeroing out a plane's watermarks in the middle of the atomic commit
without restoring them later.
Simple reproduction recipe:
- Get a SKL laptop, launch any kind of X session
- Get two extra monitors
- Keep hotplugging both displays (so that the display configuration
jumps from 1 active pipe to 3 active pipes and back)
- Eventually underrun
Changes since v1:
- Fix incorrect use of "it's"
Changes since v2:
- Add reproduction recipe

drm/i915/skl: Update DDB values atomically with wms/plane attrs
commit 27082493e9c6371b05370a619ab9d2877c5f4726 upstream.
Now that we can hook into update\_crtcs and control the order in which we
update CRTCs at each modeset, we can finish the final step of fixing
Skylake's watermark handling by performing DDB updates at the same time
as plane updates and watermark updates.
The first major change in this patch is skl\_update\_crtcs(), which
handles ensuring that we order each CRTC update in our atomic commits
properly so that they honor the DDB flush order.
The second major change in this patch is the order in which we flush the
pipes. While the previous order may have worked, it can't be used in
this approach since it no longer will do the right thing. For example,
using the old ddb flush order:
We have pipes A, B, and C enabled, and we're disabling C. Initial ddb
allocation looks like this:
| A | B |xxxxxxx|
Since we're performing the ddb updates after performing any CRTC
disablements in intel\_atomic\_commit\_tail(), the space to the right of
pipe B is unallocated.
1. Flush pipes with new allocation contained into old space. None
apply, so we skip this
2. Flush pipes having their allocation reduced, but overlapping with a
previous allocation. None apply, so we also skip this
3. Flush pipes that got more space allocated. This applies to A and B,
giving us the following update order: A, B
This is wrong, since updating pipe A first will cause it to overlap with
B and potentially burst into flames. Our new order (see the code
comments for details) would update the pipes in the proper order: B, A.
As well, we calculate the order for each DDB update during the check
phase, and reference it later in the commit phase when we hit
skl\_update\_crtcs().
This long overdue patch fixes the rest of the underruns on Skylake.
Changes since v1:
- Add skl\_ddb\_entry\_write() for cursor into skl\_write\_cursor\_wm()
Changes since v2:
- Use the method for updating CRTCs that Ville suggested
- In skl\_update\_wm(), only copy the watermarks for the crtc that was
passed to us
Changes since v3:
- Small comment fix in skl\_ddb\_allocation\_overlaps()
Changes since v4:
- Remove the second loop in intel\_update\_crtcs() and use Ville's
suggestion for updating the ddb allocations in the right order
- Get rid of the second loop and just use the ddb state as it updates
to determine what order to update everything in (thanks for the
suggestion Ville)
- Simplify skl\_ddb\_allocation\_overlaps()
- Split actual overlap checking into it's own helper

drm/i915: Move CRTC updating in atomic\_commit into it's own hook
commit 896e5bb022bce64e29ce2e1b2fc2a7476d311a15 upstream.
Since we have to write ddb allocations at the same time as we do other
plane updates, we're going to need to be able to control the order in
which we execute modesets on each pipe. The easiest way to do this is to
just factor this section of intel\_atomic\_commit\_tail()
(intel\_atomic\_commit() for stable branches) into it's own function, and
add an appropriate display function hook for it.
Based off of Matt Rope's suggestions
Changes since v1:
- Drop pipe\_config->base.active check in intel\_update\_crtcs() since we
check that before calling the function

drm/i915/skl: Update plane watermarks atomically during plane updates
commit 62e0fb880123c98793e5c3ba8355501b0305e92e upstream.
Thanks to Ville for suggesting this as a potential solution to pipe
underruns on Skylake.
On Skylake all of the registers for configuring planes, including the
registers for configuring their watermarks, are double buffered. New
values written to them won't take effect until said registers are
"armed", which is done by writing to the PLANE\_SURF (or in the case of
cursor planes, the CURBASE register) register.
With this in mind, up until now we've been updating watermarks on skl
like this:
non-modeset {
- calculate (during atomic check phase)
- finish\_atomic\_commit:
- intel\_pre\_plane\_update:
- intel\_update\_watermarks()
- {vblank happens; new watermarks + old plane values => underrun }
- drm\_atomic\_helper\_commit\_planes\_on\_crtc:
- start vblank evasion
- write new plane registers
- end vblank evasion
}
or
modeset {
- calculate (during atomic check phase)
- finish\_atomic\_commit:
- crtc\_enable:
- intel\_update\_watermarks()
- {vblank happens; new watermarks + old plane values => underrun }
- drm\_atomic\_helper\_commit\_planes\_on\_crtc:
- start vblank evasion
- write new plane registers
- end vblank evasion
}
Now we update watermarks atomically like this:
non-modeset {
- calculate (during atomic check phase)
- finish\_atomic\_commit:
- intel\_pre\_plane\_update:
- intel\_update\_watermarks() (wm values aren't written yet)
- drm\_atomic\_helper\_commit\_planes\_on\_crtc:
- start vblank evasion
- write new plane registers
- write new wm values
- end vblank evasion
}
modeset {
- calculate (during atomic check phase)
- finish\_atomic\_commit:
- crtc\_enable:
- intel\_update\_watermarks() (actual wm values aren't written
yet)
- drm\_atomic\_helper\_commit\_planes\_on\_crtc:
- start vblank evasion
- write new plane registers
- write new wm values
- end vblank evasion
}
So this patch moves all of the watermark writes into the right place;
inside of the vblank evasion where we update all of the registers for
each plane. While this patch doesn't fix everything, it does allow us to
update the watermark values in the way the hardware expects us to.
Changes since original patch series:
- Remove mutex\_lock/mutex\_unlock since they don't do anything and we're
not touching global state
- Move skl\_write\_cursor\_wm/skl\_write\_plane\_wm functions into
intel\_pm.c, make externally visible
- Add skl\_write\_plane\_wm calls to skl\_update\_plane
- Fix conditional for for loop in skl\_write\_plane\_wm (level < max\_level
should be level <= max\_level)
- Make diagram in commit more accurate to what's actually happening
- Add Fixes:
Changes since v1:
- Use IS\_GEN9() instead of IS\_SKYLAKE() since these fixes apply to more
then just Skylake
- Update description to make it clear this patch doesn't fix everything
- Check if pipes were actually changed before writing watermarks
Changes since v2:
- Write PIPE\_WM\_LINETIME during vblank evasion
Changes since v3:
- Rebase against new SAGV patch changes
Changes since v4:
- Add a parameter to choose what skl\_wm\_values struct to use when
writing new plane watermarks
Changes since v5:
- Remove cursor ddb entry write in skl\_write\_cursor\_wm(), defer until
patch 6
- Write WM\_LINETIME in intel\_begin\_crtc\_commit()
Changes since v6:
- Remove redundant dirty\_pipes check in skl\_write\_plane\_wm (we check
this in all places where we call this function, and it was supposed
to have been removed earlier anyway)
- In i9xx\_update\_cursor(), use dev\_priv->info.gen >= 9 instead of
IS\_GEN9(dev\_priv). We do this everywhere else and I'd imagine this
needs to be done for gen10 as well
Changes since v7:
- Fix rebase fail (unused variable obj)
- Make struct skl\_wm\_values \*wm const
- Fix indenting
- Use INTEL\_GEN() instead of dev\_priv->info.gen
Changes since v8:
- Don't forget calls to skl\_write\_plane\_wm() when disabling planes
- Use INTEL\_GEN(), not INTEL\_INFO()->gen in intel\_begin\_crtc\_commit()

drm/prime: Pass the right module owner through to dma\_buf\_export()
commit 56a76c0123d6cb034975901c80fce2627338ef9e upstream.
dma\_buf\_export() adds a reference to the owning module to the dmabuf (to
prevent the driver from being unloaded whilst a third party still refers
to the dmabuf). However, drm\_gem\_prime\_export() was passing its own
THIS\_MODULE (i.e. drm.ko) rather than the driver. Extract the right
owner from the device->fops instead.
v2: Use C99 initializers to zero out unset elements of
dma\_buf\_export\_info
v3: Extract the right module from dev->fops.
Testcase: igt/vgem\_basic/unload

drm/vc4: Fix races when the CS reads from render targets.
commit 7edabee06a5622190d59689a64f5e17d1c343cc3 upstream.
With the introduction of bin/render pipelining, the previous job may
not be completed when we start binning the next one. If the previous
job wrote our VBO, IB, or CS textures, then the binning stage might
get stale or uninitialized results.
Fixes the major rendering failure in glmark2 -b terrain.

iio: ad5755: fix off-by-one on devnr limit checkThe comparison for devnr limits is off-by-one, the current check
allows 0 to AD5755\_NUM\_CHANNELS and the limit should be in fact
0 to AD5755\_NUM\_CHANNELS - 1. This can lead to an out of bounds
write to pdata->dac[devnr]. Fix this by replacing > with >= on the
comparison.
