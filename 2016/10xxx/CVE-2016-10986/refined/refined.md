Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10986 (based on context of the blog post title and date)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tweet-wheel WordPress plugin does not sanitize the `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret` parameters when they are used to populate form input fields in the `auth.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The unsanitized input parameters are directly echoed back into the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they visit a page with the vulnerable form. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Phishing attacks
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests that include malicious Javascript in the vulnerable parameters (`consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret`). When the form is rendered, the injected Javascript is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress instance running the vulnerable plugin. This typically requires no prior authentication and can be done remotely. They would need to craft the POST request to include the malicious javascript in the specified parameters.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `testfiles/tweet-wheel/includes/views/auth.php` at lines 34, 40, 46, and 52.
- The fix is to update to version 1.0.4 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered on March 14, 2016, and publicly disclosed on April 21, 2016 after a delayed response from the vendor.
- The plugin has been closed as of April 23, 2021 due to a licensing/trademark violation.
