  "CVE-2016-10253": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Erlang/OTP 18.x. Erlang's generation of compiled regular expressions is vulnerable to a heap overflow. Regular expressions using a malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an offset that is used as an array index. This ordinal permits arbitrary regions within the erts_alloc arena to be both read and written to.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Malformed 'extpattern' in regular expressions allows for an attacker-controlled offset to be used as an array index.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap overflow",
        "Improper array index validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary memory read and write within the erts_alloc arena leading to a potential denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vector": "Network",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide a malicious regular expression. No privileges or user interaction is required."
