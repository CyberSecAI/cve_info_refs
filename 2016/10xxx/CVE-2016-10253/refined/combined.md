### @zv **[zv](/zv)** commented [Jun 18, 2016](#issue-161047607) • edited Loading

While I was crafting a concolic execution workload l I discovered that Erlang's generation of compiled regular expressions is vulnerable to a modestly complex heap overflow. Regular expressions using malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an offset that is used as an array index. This ordinal permits arbitrary regions within the `erts_alloc` arena can be both read and wrote to.

While ERTS maintains numerous allocators with different internal structures, a single expression can "switch" on internal type information, generalized across the alignment of heap chunk headers, this permits internal pointer value leaks as well as more indirect control over the instruction pointer.

Sorry, something went wrong.

    still less buggy then the new one written in Erlang).
  * Enabled IPv6 for odbcserver and prefer IPv4 in odbc.erl to make odbc
    application working in IPv6-only environment (closes: #598525).
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

  * Don't bytecompile erlang-flymake.el for Emacs flavors emacs21 and for
    all versions of XEmacs because they don't contain flymake
    (closes: #588474).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches.
  * Removed fix for re:compile/2 crash for a long regular expression because
    it is already included into the upstream source.
  * Since run_test is now a binary change the way it's put into the
    erlang-common-test package.
  * Split out architecture-independent erlang-ic-java package with Java
    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed generation of ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends}
    substitution variables.
  * Added a fix for a re:compile/2 crash on a long regular expression.
  * Changed urgency to medium as the change fixes a security bug.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpages in section 1 are needed even if only arch-dependent packages are
    built. So, re-enabled them.

  * Fixed HiPE architecture recognition for powerpc Debian architecture.
  * Moved xsltproc and fop to build-depends-indep and do not build
    documentation if only architecture-specific packages are built.
  * Refreshed all patches.
  * Made Emacs look in man5 and man7 for Erlang manpages and added code
    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved manpages from incorrect sections 4 and 6 to correct 5 and 7
    (closes: #498492).
  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.
  * Reorganized debian/rules to ensure that manpages aren't built twice, and
    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dialyzer(1) manpage which was placed into section 3 and conflicted
    with dialyzer(3erl).

  * New upstream release (it adds a new binary package erlang-erl-docgen).
  * Refreshed patches, removed most of emacs.patch which is applied upstream.
  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.
  * Fixed VCS headers in debian/control.
  * Moved from prebuilt manpages to generated from sources. This adds
    erlang-manpages binary package and xsltproc build dependency.

erlang (1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #539269).
  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed parentheses in Emacs mode (closes: #536891).
  * Removed unnecessary conflicts with erlang-manpages package.
  * Added workaround for #475459: disabled threads on sparc architecture.
    This breaks wxErlang, so it's only a temporary solution.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).
  * Made erlang-nox and erlang-x11 transitional packages (which will be
    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

erlang (1:13.a-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.

  * Removed patch which fixed detaching from a controlling terminal because
    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.
  * Generated run script for common_test application.
  * Updated TODO.

  * Fixed a workaround for buildd timeout while building dialyzer PLT.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture

  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386
    architecture.
  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org> to uploaders list.
  * Linked /usr/share/man to /usr/lib/erlang directory and added support for
    compressed manual pages to Erlang mode. This allows to read manual pages
    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Linked openssl libraries dynamically instead of new default static linking
    which causes difficulties with security updates.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed using incorrect original tarball in previous version. (Also,
    dfsg suffix indicates changes with respect to original distribution.)
  * Added a check for prebuilt binaries and non-free docs to debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (fixes FTBFS with glibc 2.6, closes: #434342).
  * Removed patch which fixed Delete key binding in Erlang mode for emacs
    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).

  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $\" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

erlang (1:11.b.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts.

erlang (1:11.b.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Introduce erlang-depends to calculate ${erlang-*:Depends} for packages
    that Build-Depend on erlang.
  * Setting urgency to medium because this revision does not change any
    existing functionality but it is important for future backports to etch.

erlang (1:11.b.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added IPv6 name resolution patch by Mikael Magnusson (closes: #399628)

erlang (1:11.b.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removed /dev/epoll support patch. Now /dev/epoll is supported
    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

erlang (1:11.b.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

erlang (1:11.b.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made \"make clean\" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlang-x11).
  * Added prerm and postinstall scripts which stop and start erlang-dependent
    services (otherwise certain services, e.g. ejabberd become irresponsible
    after upgrading erlang).
  * Removed gawk from Build-Depends (mawk is required package and is
    sufficient), replaced perl5 by perl because perl5 is a virtual package
    and can't be installed.
  * Moved erlang.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps.
  * Added erlang.desktop to /usr/share/apps/konsole directory making
    possible to start erlang from Konsole menu.

  * Applied patch, which fixes large list matching bug on 64-bit
    architectures (see
    http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00372.html
    and http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00425.html).
  * replaced \"-include\" for \"include\" in debian/rules to make get-orig-source
    target working in any directory (see section 4.8 of Debian Policy Manual).

erlang (1:10.b.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-dev patterns (excluded private file from orber
    application)
  * Added patch for building erlang-base-hipe on arm architecture.
  * Added libiodbc2-dev and unixodbc-dev to Build-Conflicts to prevent
    accidental building of odbc application.

erlang (1:10.b.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #345204).
  * As a side effect Erlang can be built on GNU/Hurd now.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on Sparc (Closes: #328031).
  * Added erlang-dev package, containing development files (C-interface
    headers and libraries, Erlang/OTP application headers). Closes: #367614.
  * Added erlang-examples package, containing Erlang/OTP application
    examples.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules script, added the possibility to configure
    Erlang without kernel poll support (useful for kFreeBSD and Hurd
    architectures).

erlang (1:10.b.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sergei Golovan noticed that on platforms supporting HiPE, erlang-
    base and erlang-base-hipe and configured the same way.  Fixed.
  * New maintainers: Erlang Packagers
  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed unused files (updvsn, preservebeam, extrafiles, erlang-doc.docs,
    *.install).
  * Removed unnecessary patches from patches/00list.
  * Made templates from erlang-base.links, erlang-mode.links,
    erlang-base-hipe.links. Replaced explicit version numbers to version
    templates.
  * Corrected dependencies in control file (replaced erlang-base-hipe by
    erlang-base because erlang-base-hipe is not always available, made all
    packages conflict with erlang-manpages and erlang-doc-html with
    incompatible versions).
  * Cleaned up lintian override files.
  * Made installing erlang with and without HIPE to debian/erlang-hipe and
    debian/erlang-std respectively (making debugging easier). Rewrote install
    part of the script (made it removing some src files and object files from
    ssl and crypto applications). Made some cleanups in rules.
  * Fixed warnings of missing final newline in several files.
  * Added menu entries to erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages (since they use
    /usr/bin/erl which is not present in these packages, there are also new
    entries in lintian override files).
  * Added supervisor performance improvement patch
    (http://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-19).
  * Added epoll support patch
    (http://developer.sipphone.com/ejabberd/erlang_epoll_patch/).
  * Restored patch which makes erl -man searching manual pages in the
    standard locations.
  * Moved sasl and stdlib beams from erlang-nox to erlang-base-hipe and
    erlang-base packages making them usable without erlang-nox.
  * Closes: #367996
  * Replaced Ericcson by Ericsson in control file (Closes: #368808)
  * Added conflicts of erlang-nox, erlang-x11, erlang-base, erlang-base-hipe
    with erlang-src of incompatible version.

  * Closes: #358179: Removed the copy of the LGPL in the copyright file.
    I've put the required shorter text.
  * Disabled HiPE build for mips, arm, mipsel, s390 and sparc, in hope
    that it fixes FTBFS on those platforms.
  * Closes: #358410.  erlang-src and erlang-mode are now Architecture:
    all.
  * erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are now built as arch-dependent targets
    since, practically, they depend on one of erlang-runtime to be
    built.
  * Added a link from /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include to /usr/include/erlang
    to fix potential FTBFS of dependencies of Erlang.
  * cant install erlang package (dependencie problem) (Closes: #366398)

    dependencies.
  * Closes: #344118, added a missing \",\" in Depends in the
    control file.
  * Removed dependency to bash v3, which means Erlang 10.b.9-2 is
    backportable to Sarge thanks to Sergei Golovan.
  * 10.b.9-1 was a test version that was announced on the erlang-
    questions mailing list.
  * erlang-manpages: Manpages are not where erl -man looks for them
    (Closes: #348333). erl -man is now using the standard manual path
    and MANSECT=1:3erl:4:6.
  * /usr/bin/ear is a dangling symlink (Closes: #346548)
  * Removed ear, ecc, elink, escript, which are bad links produced even
    by the standard erlang install (I sure should ask erlang-questions
    about those).

    independent package in two.  There is now an erlang-nox package
    which include the base applications that don't require tk8.4 to
    work.  The applications that depend on gs and thus on tk8.4 and now
    in erlang-x11.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.

    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).

    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.

    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.
  * Generated run script for common_test application.

  * Fixed a workaround for buildd timeout while building dialyzer PLT.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture
    (closes: #456868).
  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386
    architecture.
  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org> to uploaders list.
  * Linked /usr/share/man to /usr/lib/erlang directory and added support for
    compressed manual pages to Erlang mode. This allows to read manual pages
    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Linked openssl libraries dynamically instead of new default static linking
    which causes difficulties with security updates.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed using incorrect original tarball in previous version. (Also,
    dfsg suffix indicates changes with respect to original distribution.)
  * Added a check for prebuilt binaries and non-free docs to debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (fixes FTBFS with glibc 2.6, closes: #434342).
  * Removed patch which fixed Delete key binding in Erlang mode for emacs
    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).
  * Fixed binary-arch and binary-indep targets dependencies in debian/rules.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Replaced `ps` by `pgrep` in prerm scripts to make them more clear.
  * Added dependency on procps package because `pgrep` is used in prerm
    scripts and procps is not an essential package (closes: #417413).
  * Updated TODO.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).

  * Made "make clean" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlang-x11).
  * Added prerm and postinstall scripts which stop and start erlang-dependent
    services (otherwise certain services, e.g. ejabberd become irresponsible
    after upgrading erlang).
  * Removed gawk from Build-Depends (mawk is required package and is
    sufficient), replaced perl5 by perl because perl5 is a virtual package
    and can't be installed.
  * Moved erlang.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps.
  * Added erlang.desktop to /usr/share/apps/konsole directory making
    possible to start erlang from Konsole menu.

  * Removed unnecessary patches from patches/00list.
  * Made templates from erlang-base.links, erlang-mode.links,
    erlang-base-hipe.links. Replaced explicit version numbers to version
    templates.
  * Corrected dependencies in control file (replaced erlang-base-hipe by
    erlang-base because erlang-base-hipe is not always available, made all
    packages conflict with erlang-manpages and erlang-doc-html with
    incompatible versions).
  * Cleaned up lintian override files.
  * Made installing erlang with and without HIPE to debian/erlang-hipe and
    debian/erlang-std respectively (making debugging easier). Rewrote install
    part of the script (made it removing some src files and object files from
    ssl and crypto applications). Made some cleanups in rules.
  * Fixed warnings of missing final newline in several files.
  * Added menu entries to erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages (since they use
    /usr/bin/erl which is not present in these packages, there are also new
    entries in lintian override files).

    with erlang-src of incompatible version.

erlang (1:10.b.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Francois-Denis Gonthier ]
  * Disables HiPE build for hppa64 and m68k.
  * Upgraded policy version.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * disabled HiPE build an arm (not only armv4l)
  * added myself to the Uploaders: field in debian/control

erlang (1:10.b.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #366398: Same has #358410.
  * Closes: #357134: NMU of Luk Claes.  Most of those errors were already
    fixed in the new package.  Thanks.
  * Closes: #358179: Removed the copy of the LGPL in the copyright file.
    I've put the required shorter text.
  * Disabled HiPE build for mips, arm, mipsel, s390 and sparc, in hope
    that it fixes FTBFS on those platforms.
  * Closes: #358410.  erlang-src and erlang-mode are now Architecture:
    all.
  * erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are now built as arch-dependent targets
    since, practically, they depend on one of erlang-runtime to be
    built.
  * Added a link from /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include to /usr/include/erlang
    to fix potential FTBFS of dependencies of Erlang.
  * cant install erlang package (dependencie problem) (Closes: #366398)

erlang (1:10.b.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #333853, moved driver_int.h and erl_driver.h to
    /usr/include.
  * Closes: #331817, added debconf-2.0 alternative to erlang
    dependencies.
  * Closes: #344118, added a missing "," in Depends in the
    control file.
  * Removed dependency to bash v3, which means Erlang 10.b.9-2 is
    backportable to Sarge thanks to Sergei Golovan.
  * 10.b.9-1 was a test version that was announced on the erlang-
    questions mailing list.
  * erlang-manpages: Manpages are not where erl -man looks for them
    (Closes: #348333). erl -man is now using the standard manual path
    and MANSECT=1:3erl:4:6.
  * /usr/bin/ear is a dangling symlink (Closes: #346548)
  * Removed ear, ecc, elink, escript, which are bad links produced even
    by the standard erlang install (I sure should ask erlang-questions
    about those).
  * FTBFS: build-depends on removed xlibs-dev (Closes: #346655)

erlang (1:10.b.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

erlang (1:10.b.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * HiPE-enabled binaries are now put in their own package.
  * Source files (*.erl, *.hrl, *.c and *.h) are now put in their own
    package since they are not required to use the system.
  * Well, I have dpatch'ified the thing but since I now use svn-
    buildpackage locally, the patches are not rather useless.
  * Closes: #333853
  * Closes: #331817
  * Major rules overhaul.  I've had some problems getting some targets
    to run twice but I worked around them.

erlang (1:10.b.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * fully dpatch'ified.
  * Emacs editing mode pulled from the main package and put into it's
    own erlang-mode package.
  * As it was suggested a few times, I've split the main arch-
    independent package in two.  There is now an erlang-nox package
    which include the base applications that don't require tk8.4 to
    work.  The applications that depend on gs and thus on tk8.4 and now
    in erlang-x11.
  * The files that go in the 3 packages are now determined using regular
    expressions.  See analyse.sh for details.

erlang (1:10.b.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now using autooconf2.5x
  * The whole package is now dpatch'ified.
  * I've simplified the aggressive cleaning done in the clean phase…

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches, removed the dialyzer patch which is included into
    the upstream tarball.
  * Switched to xz compressed tarball to save bandwidth. It is recompressed

  * New upstream release (upload to experimental because of freeze).
  * Removed debian/patches/m68k.patch which doesn't work anymore anyway.
  * Created a separate manpage for to_erl(1) by copying the relevant info
    from /usr/share/doc/erlang-doc/doc/embedded/embedded_solaris.html.

erlang (1:15.b.2-dfsg-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added link for to_erl communication program to /usr/bin. Also linked its
    manpage to run_erl.1 because there's no direct documentation on to_erl and
    it's intended to use in cooperation with run_erl.

erlang (1:15.b.2-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (upload to experimental because of freeze).
  * Refreshed patches.

erlang (1:15.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved kernel and stdlib include files from erlang-dev to the erlang-base
    and erlang-base-hipe packages, and snmp include to erlang-snmp because

    on erlang-dev unnecesary.
  * Moved sources of the erl_docgen application to the erlang-src package.
  * Switched to xz compression of binary packages to save mirror disk space
    and network bandwidth.

erlang (1:15.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on procps unconditionally since it works for all architectures now.
  * Create symlinks to erlang-mode sources when installing it to any Emacs
    flavor. This helps to use M-x describe-function for erlang mode in Emacs
    (closes: #670345).
  * Removed stale symlink to /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include/driver.h.
  * Fixed a few errors in manpages and added missing whatis entries.

erlang (1:15.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added new package erlang-eldap with Erlang LDAP library.
  * Added eldap application license to debian/copyright.
  * Use (debian-pkg-add-load-path-item <path>) instead of manipulating

    API along with ABI, so several applications are to be fixed.
  * Removed SSL patch because the old SSL implementation is removed from
    the upstream distribution.
  * Removed never used patch which added native code to erlang beam files.
  * Removed the erlang-docbuilder binary package because the docbuilder
    application was dropped by upstream.
  * Documented dropping ${erlang-docbuilder:Depends} substvar in
    erlang-depends(1) manpage.
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-15.b (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI).

erlang (1:14.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #636678).
  * Added versionless symlinks to jinterface and ic Java packages in

    dependent packages only.

erlang (1:14.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #607233, #619857).
  * Removed patches which are no longer needed.
  * Created symlink to snmpc escript from /usr/bin directory. Added erlang-dev
    to the snmps recommended dependencies because snmpc uses some include
    files.
  * Added patch by upstream which fixes send_timeout option for TCP sockets.

erlang (1:14.b.1-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Renamed /usr/bin/run_test link to /usr/bin/ct_run following upstream.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a few spelling errors in packages descriptions and Debian changelog
    entries (closes: #592995, #597464).
  * Applised patch by upstream which fixes wx application crash
    (closes: #592821).
  * Switched to the old OpenSSL-based SSL implementation by default (it is
    still less buggy then the new one written in Erlang).
  * Enabled IPv6 for odbcserver and prefer IPv4 in odbc.erl to make odbc
    application working in IPv6-only environment (closes: #598525).
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

erlang (1:14.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't bytecompile erlang-flymake.el for Emacs flavors emacs21 and for
    all versions of XEmacs because they don't contain flymake
    (closes: #588474).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches.
  * Removed fix for re:compile/2 crash for a long regular expression because
    it is already included into the upstream source.
  * Since run_test is now a binary change the way it's put into the
    erlang-common-test package.
  * Split out architecture-independent erlang-ic-java package with Java
    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed generation of ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends}
    substitution variables.
  * Added a fix for a re:compile/2 crash on a long regular expression.
  * Changed urgency to medium as the change fixes a security bug.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpages in section 1 are needed even if only arch-dependent packages are
    built. So, re-enabled them.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed HiPE architecture recognition for powerpc Debian architecture.
  * Moved xsltproc and fop to build-depends-indep and do not build
    documentation if only architecture-specific packages are built.
  * Refreshed all patches.
  * Made Emacs look in man5 and man7 for Erlang manpages and added code
    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved manpages from incorrect sections 4 and 6 to correct 5 and 7
    (closes: #498492).
  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.
  * Reorganized debian/rules to ensure that manpages aren't built twice, and
    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dialyzer(1) manpage which was placed into section 3 and conflicted
    with dialyzer(3erl).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (it adds a new binary package erlang-erl-docgen).
  * Refreshed patches, removed most of emacs.patch which is applied upstream.
  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.
  * Fixed VCS headers in debian/control.
  * Moved from prebuilt manpages to generated from sources. This adds
    erlang-manpages binary package and xsltproc build dependency.

erlang (1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #539269).
  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed parentheses in Emacs mode (closes: #536891).
  * Removed unnecessary conflicts with erlang-manpages package.
  * Added workaround for #475459: disabled threads on sparc architecture.
    This breaks wxErlang, so it's only a temporary solution.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).
  * Made erlang-nox and erlang-x11 transitional packages (which will be
    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

erlang (1:13.a-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable after lenny is released.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed patch which fixed detaching from a controlling terminal because
    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.
  * Generated run script for common_test application.
  * Updated TODO.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a workaround for buildd timeout while building dialyzer PLT.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture
    (closes: #456868).
  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386
    architecture.
  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org> to uploaders list.
  * Linked /usr/share/man to /usr/lib/erlang directory and added support for
    compressed manual pages to Erlang mode. This allows to read manual pages
    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Linked openssl libraries dynamically instead of new default static linking
    which causes difficulties with security updates.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed using incorrect original tarball in previous version. (Also,
    dfsg suffix indicates changes with respect to original distribution.)
  * Added a check for prebuilt binaries and non-free docs to debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (fixes FTBFS with glibc 2.6, closes: #434342).
  * Removed patch which fixed Delete key binding in Erlang mode for emacs
    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).
  * Fixed binary-arch and binary-indep targets dependencies in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed cleanup after package build (closes: #424198).

    application (closes: #413401).

erlang (1:11.b.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Replaced `ps` by `pgrep` in prerm scripts to make them more clear.
  * Added dependency on procps package because `pgrep` is used in prerm
    scripts and procps is not an essential package (closes: #417413).
  * Updated TODO.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release R11B-4.
  * Added stub manual page for escript.

erlang (1:11.b.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Change header of erlang-depends(1) man page.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $\" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

erlang (1:11.b.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts.

  * Introduce erlang-depends to calculate ${erlang-*:Depends} for packages
    that Build-Depend on erlang.
  * Setting urgency to medium because this revision does not change any
    existing functionality but it is important for future backports to etch.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removed /dev/epoll support patch. Now /dev/epoll is supported
    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

erlang (1:11.b.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made \"make clean\" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlang-x11).
  * Added prerm and postinstall scripts which stop and start erlang-dependent
    services (otherwise certain services, e.g. ejabberd become irresponsible
    after upgrading erlang).
  * Removed gawk from Build-Depends (mawk is required package and is
    sufficient), replaced perl5 by perl because perl5 is a virtual package
    and can't be installed.
  * Moved erlang.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps.
  * Added erlang.desktop to /usr/share/apps/konsole directory making
    possible to start erlang from Konsole menu.

  * Added libiodbc2-dev and unixodbc-dev to Build-Conflicts to prevent
    accidental building of odbc application.

  * As a side effect Erlang can be built on GNU/Hurd now.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on Sparc (Closes: #328031).
  * Added erlang-dev package, containing development files (C-interface
    headers and libraries, Erlang/OTP application headers). Closes: #367614.
  * Added erlang-examples package, containing Erlang/OTP application
    examples.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules script, added the possibility to configure
    Erlang without kernel poll support (useful for kFreeBSD and Hurd
    architectures).

  * Removed unused files (updvsn, preservebeam, extrafiles, erlang-doc.docs,
    *.install).
  * Removed unnecessary patches from patches/00list.
  * Made templates from erlang-base.links, erlang-mode.links,
    erlang-base-hipe.links. Replaced explicit version numbers to version
    templates.
  * Corrected dependencies in control file (replaced erlang-base-hipe by
    erlang-base because erlang-base-hipe is not always available, made all
    packages conflict with erlang-manpages and erlang-doc-html with
    incompatible versions).
  * Cleaned up lintian override files.
  * Made installing erlang with and without HIPE to debian/erlang-hipe and
    debian/erlang-std respectively (making debugging easier). Rewrote install
    part of the script (made it removing some src files and object files from
    ssl and crypto applications). Made some cleanups in rules.
  * Fixed warnings of missing final newline in several files.
  * Added menu entries to erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages (since they use
    /usr/bin/erl which is not present in these packages, there are also new
    entries in lintian override files).
  * Added supervisor performance improvement patch
    (http://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-19).
  * Added epoll support patch
    (http://developer.sipphone.com/ejabberd/erlang_epoll_patch/).
  * Restored patch which makes erl -man searching manual pages in the
    standard locations.
  * Moved sasl and stdlib beams from erlang-nox to erlang-base-hipe and
    erlang-base packages making them usable without erlang-nox.

  * Removed never used patch which added native code to erlang beam files.
  * Removed the erlang-docbuilder binary package because the docbuilder
    application was dropped by upstream.
  * Documented dropping ${erlang-docbuilder:Depends} substvar in
    erlang-depends(1) manpage.
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-15.b (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI).

erlang (1:14.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #636678).
  * Added versionless symlinks to jinterface and ic Java packages in

  * New upstream release (closes: #607233, #619857).
  * Removed patches which are no longer needed.
  * Created symlink to snmpc escript from /usr/bin directory. Added erlang-dev
    to the snmps recommended dependencies because snmpc uses some include
    files.
  * Added patch by upstream which fixes send_timeout option for TCP sockets.

erlang (1:14.b.1-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Renamed /usr/bin/run_test link to /usr/bin/ct_run following upstream.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a few spelling errors in packages descriptions and Debian changelog
    entries (closes: #592995, #597464).
  * Applised patch by upstream which fixes wx application crash
    (closes: #592821).
  * Switched to the old OpenSSL-based SSL implementation by default (it is
    still less buggy then the new one written in Erlang).
  * Enabled IPv6 for odbcserver and prefer IPv4 in odbc.erl to make odbc
    application working in IPv6-only environment (closes: #598525).
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

  * Don't bytecompile erlang-flymake.el for Emacs flavors emacs21 and for
    all versions of XEmacs because they don't contain flymake
    (closes: #588474).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches.
  * Removed fix for re:compile/2 crash for a long regular expression because
    it is already included into the upstream source.
  * Since run_test is now a binary change the way it's put into the
    erlang-common-test package.
  * Split out architecture-independent erlang-ic-java package with Java
    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed generation of ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends}
    substitution variables.
  * Added a fix for a re:compile/2 crash on a long regular expression.
  * Changed urgency to medium as the change fixes a security bug.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpages in section 1 are needed even if only arch-dependent packages are
    built. So, re-enabled them.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed HiPE architecture recognition for powerpc Debian architecture.
  * Moved xsltproc and fop to build-depends-indep and do not build
    documentation if only architecture-specific packages are built.
  * Refreshed all patches.
  * Made Emacs look in man5 and man7 for Erlang manpages and added code
    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved manpages from incorrect sections 4 and 6 to correct 5 and 7
    (closes: #498492).
  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.
  * Reorganized debian/rules to ensure that manpages aren't built twice, and
    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dialyzer(1) manpage which was placed into section 3 and conflicted
    with dialyzer(3erl).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (it adds a new binary package erlang-erl-docgen).
  * Refreshed patches, removed most of emacs.patch which is applied upstream.
  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.
  * Fixed VCS headers in debian/control.
  * Moved from prebuilt manpages to generated from sources. This adds
    erlang-manpages binary package and xsltproc build dependency.

erlang (1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #539269).
  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed parentheses in Emacs mode (closes: #536891).
  * Removed unnecessary conflicts with erlang-manpages package.
  * Added workaround for #475459: disabled threads on sparc architecture.
    This breaks wxErlang, so it's only a temporary solution.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).
  * Made erlang-nox and erlang-x11 transitional packages (which will be
    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

erlang (1:13.a-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.

  * Removed patch which fixed detaching from a controlling terminal because
    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture

  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386

  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).
  * Fixed binary-arch and binary-indep targets dependencies in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed cleanup after package build (closes: #424198).
  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson, which adds IPv6 support to ssl
    application (closes: #413401).

erlang (1:11.b.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Replaced `ps` by `pgrep` in prerm scripts to make them more clear.
  * Added dependency on procps package because `pgrep` is used in prerm
    scripts and procps is not an essential package (closes: #417413).
  * Updated TODO.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release R11B-4.
  * Added stub manual page for escript.

erlang (1:11.b.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Change header of erlang-depends(1) man page.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

erlang (1:11.b.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts.

erlang (1:11.b.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Introduce erlang-depends to calculate ${erlang-*:Depends} for packages
    that Build-Depend on erlang.
  * Setting urgency to medium because this revision does not change any
    existing functionality but it is important for future backports to etch.

erlang (1:11.b.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added IPv6 name resolution patch by Mikael Magnusson (closes: #399628)

erlang (1:11.b.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removed /dev/epoll support patch. Now /dev/epoll is supported
    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

erlang (1:11.b.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

erlang (1:11.b.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made "make clean" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlang-x11).
  * Added prerm and postinstall scripts which stop and start erlang-dependent
    services (otherwise certain services, e.g. ejabberd become irresponsible
    after upgrading erlang).
  * Removed gawk from Build-Depends (mawk is required package and is
    sufficient), replaced perl5 by perl because perl5 is a virtual package
    and can't be installed.
  * Moved erlang.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps.
  * Added erlang.desktop to /usr/share/apps/konsole directory making
    possible to start erlang from Konsole menu.

erlang (1:11.b.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.

erlang (1:10.b.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-x11.menu (Erlang Toplevel requires terminal).
  * Applied patch, which fixes large list matching bug on 64-bit
    architectures (see
    http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00372.html
    and http://www.erlang.org/ml-archive/erlang-questions/200606/msg00425.html).
  * replaced "-include" for "include" in debian/rules to make get-orig-source
    target working in any directory (see section 4.8 of Debian Policy Manual).

erlang (1:10.b.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-dev patterns (excluded private file from orber
    application)
  * Added patch for building erlang-base-hipe on arm architecture.
  * Added libiodbc2-dev and unixodbc-dev to Build-Conflicts to prevent
    accidental building of odbc application.

erlang (1:10.b.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #345204).
  * As a side effect Erlang can be built on GNU/Hurd now.
  * Added patch for building Erlang on Sparc (Closes: #328031).
  * Added erlang-dev package, containing development files (C-interface
    headers and libraries, Erlang/OTP application headers). Closes: #367614.
  * Added erlang-examples package, containing Erlang/OTP application
    examples.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules script, added the possibility to configure
    Erlang without kernel poll support (useful for kFreeBSD and Hurd
    architectures).

erlang (1:10.b.9-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sergei Golovan noticed that on platforms supporting HiPE, erlang-
    base and erlang-base-hipe and configured the same way.  Fixed.
  * New maintainers: Erlang Packagers
  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed unused files (updvsn, preservebeam, extrafiles, erlang-doc.docs,
    *.install).
  * Removed unnecessary patches from patches/00list.
  * Made templates from erlang-base.links, erlang-mode.links,
    erlang-base-hipe.links. Replaced explicit version numbers to version
    templates.
  * Corrected dependencies in control file (replaced erlang-base-hipe by
    erlang-base because erlang-base-hipe is not always available, made all
    packages conflict with erlang-manpages and erlang-doc-html with
    incompatible versions).
  * Cleaned up lintian override files.
  * Made installing erlang with and without HIPE to debian/erlang-hipe and
    debian/erlang-std respectively (making debugging easier). Rewrote install
    part of the script (made it removing some src files and object files from
    ssl and crypto applications). Made some cleanups in rules.
  * Fixed warnings of missing final newline in several files.
  * Added menu entries to erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages (since they use
    /usr/bin/erl which is not present in these packages, there are also new
    entries in lintian override files).
  * Added supervisor performance improvement patch
    (http://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-19).
  * Added epoll support patch
    (http://developer.sipphone.com/ejabberd/erlang_epoll_patch/).
  * Restored patch which makes erl -man searching manual pages in the
    standard locations.
  * Moved sasl and stdlib beams from erlang-nox to erlang-base-hipe and
    erlang-base packages making them usable without erlang-nox.
  * Closes: #367996
  * Replaced Ericcson by Ericsson in control file (Closes: #368808)
  * Added conflicts of erlang-nox, erlang-x11, erlang-base, erlang-base-hipe
    with erlang-src of incompatible version.

erlang (1:10.b.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Francois-Denis Gonthier ]
  * Disables HiPE build for hppa64 and m68k.
  * Upgraded policy version.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * disabled HiPE build an arm (not only armv4l)
  * added myself to the Uploaders: field in debian/control

erlang (1:10.b.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #366398: Same has #358410.
  * Closes: #357134: NMU of Luk Claes.  Most of those errors were already
    fixed in the new package.  Thanks.
  * Closes: #358179: Removed the copy of the LGPL in the copyright file.
    I've put the required shorter text.
  * Disabled HiPE build for mips, arm, mipsel, s390 and sparc, in hope
    that it fixes FTBFS on those platforms.
  * Closes: #358410.  erlang-src and erlang-mode are now Architecture:
    all.
  * erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are now built as arch-dependent targets
    since, practically, they depend on one of erlang-runtime to be
    built.
  * Added a link from /usr/lib/erlang/usr/include to /usr/include/erlang
    to fix potential FTBFS of dependencies of Erlang.
  * cant install erlang package (dependencie problem) (Closes: #366398)

erlang (1:10.b.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Closes: #333853, moved driver_int.h and erl_driver.h to
    /usr/include.
  * Closes: #331817, added debconf-2.0 alternative to erlang
    dependencies.
  * Closes: #344118, added a missing "," in Depends in the
    control file.
  * Removed dependency to bash v3, which…

    entries (closes: #592995, #597464).
  * Applised patch by upstream which fixes wx application crash
    (closes: #592821).
  * Switched to the old OpenSSL-based SSL implementation by default (it is
    still less buggy then the new one written in Erlang).
  * Enabled IPv6 for odbcserver and prefer IPv4 in odbc.erl to make odbc
    application working in IPv6-only environment (closes: #598525).
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

  * New upstream release.
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it
    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't bytecompile erlang-flymake.el for Emacs flavors emacs21 and for
    all versions of XEmacs because they don't contain flymake
    (closes: #588474).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1.

erlang (1:14.a-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Refreshed patches.
  * Removed fix for re:compile/2 crash for a long regular expression because
    it is already included into the upstream source.
  * Since run_test is now a binary change the way it's put into the
    erlang-common-test package.
  * Split out architecture-independent erlang-ic-java package with Java
    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed generation of ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends}
    substitution variables.
  * Added a fix for a re:compile/2 crash on a long regular expression.
  * Changed urgency to medium as the change fixes a security bug.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manpages in section 1 are needed even if only arch-dependent packages are
    built. So, re-enabled them.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed HiPE architecture recognition for powerpc Debian architecture.
  * Moved xsltproc and fop to build-depends-indep and do not build
    documentation if only architecture-specific packages are built.
  * Refreshed all patches.
  * Made Emacs look in man5 and man7 for Erlang manpages and added code
    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Moved manpages from incorrect sections 4 and 6 to correct 5 and 7
    (closes: #498492).
  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.
  * Reorganized debian/rules to ensure that manpages aren't built twice, and
    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dialyzer(1) manpage which was placed into section 3 and conflicted
    with dialyzer(3erl).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (it adds a new binary package erlang-erl-docgen).
  * Refreshed patches, removed most of emacs.patch which is applied upstream.
  * Linked run_test binary from erlang-common-test package to /usr/bin.
  * Fixed VCS headers in debian/control.
  * Moved from prebuilt manpages to generated from sources. This adds
    erlang-manpages binary package and xsltproc build dependency.

erlang (1:13.b.2.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #539269).
  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.3.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed parentheses in Emacs mode (closes: #536891).
  * Removed unnecessary conflicts with erlang-manpages package.
  * Added workaround for #475459: disabled threads on sparc architecture.
    This breaks wxErlang, so it's only a temporary solution.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).
  * Made erlang-nox and erlang-x11 transitional packages (which will be
    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

erlang (1:13.a-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable after lenny is released.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed patch which fixed detaching from a controlling terminal because
    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.
  * Generated run script for common_test application.
  * Updated TODO.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a workaround for buildd timeout while building dialyzer PLT.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture
    (closes: #456868).
  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386
    architecture.
  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org> to uploaders list.
  * Linked /usr/share/man to /usr/lib/erlang directory and added support for
    compressed manual pages to Erlang mode. This allows to read manual pages
    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Linked openssl libraries dynamically instead of new default static linking
    which causes difficulties with security updates.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed using incorrect original tarball in previous version. (Also,
    dfsg suffix indicates changes with respect to original distribution.)
  * Added a check for prebuilt binaries and non-free docs to debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (fixes FTBFS with glibc 2.6, closes: #434342).
  * Removed patch which fixed Delete key binding in Erlang mode for emacs
    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).
  * Fixed binary-arch and binary-indep targets dependencies in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed cleanup after package build (closes: #424198).

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Replaced `ps` by `pgrep` in prerm scripts to make them more clear.
  * Added dependency on procps package because `pgrep` is used in prerm
    scripts and procps is not an essential package (closes: #417413).
  * Updated TODO.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]

  * Added stub manual page for escript.

erlang (1:11.b.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Change header of erlang-depends(1) man page.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $\" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

erlang (1:11.b.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts.

erlang (1:11.b.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Introduce erlang-depends to calculate ${erlang-*:Depends} for packages
    that Build-Depend on erlang.
  * Setting urgency to medium because this revision does not change any
    existing functionality but it is important for future backports to etch.

erlang (1:11.b.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added IPv6 name resolution patch by Mikael Magnusson (closes: #399628)

erlang (1:11.b.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removed /dev/epoll support patch. Now /dev/epoll is supported
    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

erlang (1:11.b.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

erlang (1:11.b.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made \"make clean\" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlan…")`

    is patched and cannot be replaced by a system one.

erlang (1:14.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Overridden lintian error mesage about embedded pcre3 library because it

    classes. This also moves Java build-dependencies to build-depends-indep.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bashism in debian/rules (closes: #581450).
  * Added conflict of erlang-doc package with older erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages to prevent broken situation with erlang-base
    from stable (1:12.b.5) and erlang-doc from testing (1:13.b.4).
  * Added sun-java6-jdk as an alternative build dependency to make backporting
    to lenny and building on a headless machine possible.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing symlinks to /usr/include for a few new header files.

    skeleton files to erlang-mode package.

erlang (1:13.b.4-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made manpages regexp in Emacs mode match only 3erl pages in section 3.
  * Removed docb_gen script which is no longer needed to build manpages.
  * Added erlang-doc package which contains documentation in HTML and PDF
    formats. This package replaces erlang-doc-html package and it's easier
    to synchronize it with the main Erlang packages as it's built from
    a single source package (closes: #558451).
  * Removed RPATH from ssl and crypto application binaries as required by
    Debian policy.
  * Added libwxgtk2.4-dev and libwxgtk2.6-dev to build conflicts.
  * Added a few dependencies for erlang-dialyzer, erlang-et, erlang-observer
    and erlang-examples packages which now call functions from more modules
    than in 1:13.b.3.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a workaround which disables vfork() for hppa architecture
    (closes: #562218).

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strictened check for JDK 1.5 adding a call to String(int[], int, int)
    because GCJ 4.4 doesn't implement it and OpenJDK isn't available for all
    architectures.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-manpages package section.
  * Made erlang-depends add only substvars which are requested in
    debian/control file. This minimizes number of warnings from dh_gencontrol.
    Also, improved descriptions of the functions in erlang-depends escript.
  * Added erlang-erl-docgen package to erlang-nox dependencies.
  * Made dummy packages erlang-nox and erlang-x11 architecture all.
  * Cleaned up working with custom substitution variables in debian/rules.

    aren't built at all if only architecture-dependent packages are requested.
  * Fixed project links in README.Debian.
  * Added a new package erlang-jinterface which provides tools for
    communication of Java programs with Erlang processes. This adds build
    dependency on default-jdk and as a result enables Java module for IDL
    compiler.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.4.

erlang (1:13.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer's email address pkg-erlang-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
    mailing list.
  * Overridden another lintian warning about image file in /usr/lib.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restored debug info in beam files for default build. It's better to use
    more space than to ship broken modules (debugger, dialyzer). The patch
    is simply commented out in debian/patches/series, so if someone has to
    strip debug info, he can simply uncomment it.
  * Disabled SMP support for hurd-i386 architecture, because of FTBFS in case
    when SMP is enabled.
  * Added debian/README.source file with a reference to
    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made mutual dependencies of Erlang packages more parsimonious (removed
    unnecessary dependencies following erlang-depends advise).
  * Added several new options to erlang-depends tool (-v, -P, --ignore).

    removed after squeeze release).
  * Guarded change in the m68k patch for non-m68k architectures.
  * Fixed building Erlang VM with debug information compiled in. Added a few
    words about debug build to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Torsten Werner from the uploaders list as per his request.
  * Removed full path from epmd calls in erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    prerm scripts.
  * Added ${erlang:Depends} substvar which expands into a list of Erlang
    packages which modules are actually used in application.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.2.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated manpages for section 1.
  * Applied patch by James Henstridge, which sets ERL_COMPILE_FLAGS based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. By default slim runtime without debug info is built.
    To remove slim option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'nostrip', to add debug_info
    compiler option set DEB_BUILD_OPTION to 'debug'. Or it may be set to
    'nostrip,debug' to return to the previous level of debug information
    (closes: #532757).
  * Added a few words about building Erlang packages with debug info included
    to README.Debian.

erlang (1:13.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed unnecessary dependency of erlang-os-mon on erlang-observer and
    erlang-tools and added missing dependency of erlang-nox on erlang-os-mon
    (closes: #529512).
  * Removed a patch to eunit application because the bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another bunch of non-free RFCs from original tarball
    (closes: #527053).
  * Fixed build-dependencies list by adding missing comma. This requires
    libsctp-dev again. Also, added libsctp1 dependency to erlang-base and
    erlang-base-hipe packages because the shared library is loaded via
    dlopen now and cannot be added using dh_slibdeps (closes: #526682).
  * Weakened dependency of erlang-webtool on erlang-observer to recommends
    to avoid circular dependencies (closes: #526627).
  * Added solaris-i386 to HiPE enabled architectures.
  * Made script sources in /usr/lib/erlang/erts-*/bin directory executable,
    which is more convenient if a user wants to create a target Erlang system.
  * Shortened extended description line for erlang-dev package to make it
    fit 80x25 terminals.

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up patches: removed unneeded patch which helped to support
    different SCTP library versions, made sure that changes for m68k
    architecture applied only when building on this architecture.
  * Removed duplicated information from binary packages descriptions.
  * Don't require libsctp-dev build-dependency on solaris-i386 architecture
    which allows to build Erlang on Nexenta (thanks to Tim Spriggs for
    the suggestion).

erlang (1:13.b-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Reduced number of packaged in build dependencies (removed unnecessary
    freeglut3-dev).
  * Added all new packages to erlang-depends script.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.
  * Temporarily changed architecture of erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages
    from all to any. Otherwise they will be broken during transition period
    when the new split Erlang is uploaded but isn't built on all architectures
    yet.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Added a patch by upstream to eunit application. It makes eunit compatible
    with Erlang R13B.

erlang (1:13.a-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta release.
  * Added packages libwxgtk2.8-dev, freeglut3-dev to build dependencies to make
    wxErlang buildable.
  * Split erlang-nox and erlang-x11 packages into a bunch of smaller packages
    for individual Erlang/OTP applications. erlang-nox and erlang-x11 are still
    exist and depend on the correspondent packages.
  * Overridden lintian error 'embedded-zlib' because zlib included into Erlang
    VM is patched, so using system-wide zlib will lead to unknown consequences.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which fixes HTTP URI decoding if {packet, http} socket
    option is used.
  * Added a patch which fixes backquote syntax in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #494823). Thanks to Balint Reczey.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.1.
  * Put start scripts and releases sources into erlang-src package. They
    are needed when a target Erlang system is to be created.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable after lenny is released.

erlang (1:12.b.5-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed patch which fixed detaching from a controlling terminal because
    this bug was fixed upstream.

erlang (1:12.b.4-dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Mangled debian version number in uscan control file debian/watch because
    it contains -dfsg suffix.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed erlang-depends script to add optional dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    to ${erlang-base:Depends} substvar for all architecture-independent
    packages. Otherwise building them on different architectures will lead to
    different dependencies.
  * Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser headers to debian/control.
  * Removed package libgd2-xpm-dev from build dependencies which is not
    necessary anymore.
  * Added a patch which fixes detaching of erlang process from a controlling
    terminal (closes: #463538).

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed patches to re-enable building erlang regexp driver for common_test
    application on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Refreshed patches and made their description more clear.
  * Made dependencies of architecture-independent packages erlang,
    erlang-examples and erlang-src the same regardless of whether they are
    built on HiPE-enabled architecture or not.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted erlang-base-hipe package priority to extra as it conflicts with
    erlang-base.
  * Added several substitution variables in debian/control to remove
    dependencies on hurd and erlang-base-hipe for architectures where these
    packages don't exist.
  * Changed erlang-depends script to generate dependency on erlang-base-hipe
    only for architectures where HiPE is available.
  * Enabled kernel poll for kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 architectures.
  * Explicitly specified host and build architecture to erlang configure
    script.
  * Typer application requires dialyzer to work, so moved it to erlang-x11
    package.
  * Added a typer manpage based on typer --help output.

erlang (1:12.b.3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed perl from build dependencies because it is build-essential.
  * Added checks for error code 2 after quilt invocation which means that all
    patches are already pushed/popped. This allows to convert the source
    package to 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Enabled building of erlang regexp driver for kfreebsd-* and hurd-i386
    architectures.
  * Unconditionally enabled SMP and hybrid heap (which currently doesn't build
    anyway) emulators in configure call.
  * Reordered calls to dh_makeshlibs, dh_shlibdeps, dh_installdeb in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed unused lintian overrides from erlang-nox and erlang-src packages.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.8.0.
  * Fixed references to manpages from section 3 (replaced (3) by (3erl)).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed clean target to work with debhelper 7.0 (made dh_clean the last
    command, so debhelper logs are removed now).

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a patch by Balint Reczey <balint@balintreczey.hu> which adds missing
    SCTP_ADDR_CONFIRMED event to Erlang SCTP API (closes: #475540). To use
    this event erlang must be build with libsctp-dev (>= 1.0.7).
  * Moved percept application from erlang-x11 to erlang-nox because it doesn't
    require libgd2-xpm anymore.

erlang (1:12.b.2-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed a patch which allowed to build Erlang with HiPE on i386
    architecture with glibc 2.7 because it is included into upstream
    distribution.
  * Removed patch which defined MAXHOSTNAMELEN because orber doesn't need it
    anymore on hurd-i386.
  * Updated manual pages.
  * Cleaned LDFLAGS environment variable when configuring rx library (in
    common_test application) to make it work with newer GCC.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for mips and mipsel architectures.
  * Removed workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 for m68k architecture.
  * Added -fno-strict-aliasing to GCC options to make casting integers to
    pointers possible (it's a workaround for C99 rule violation).
    Closes: #472554.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved README to /usr/share/doc/erlang-mode/ directory.
  * Clarified titles in menu and desktop files.
  * Generated run script for common_test application.
  * Updated TODO.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a workaround for buildd timeout while building dialyzer PLT.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copied Erlang Emacs mode files to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/erlang
    instead of linking which allows to loosen erlang-mode dependencies. Now it
    becomes more reliable and doesn't break in unstable until buildd compiles
    erlang on the corresponding architecture.
  * Moved link /usr/lib/erlang/man -> /usr/share/man from erlang-base to
    erlang-mode package since it is used only to allow showing manpages by
    Emacs.

erlang (1:12.b.1-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added a patch which fixes building common_test application shared library
    on certain architectures (added -fPIC to gcc options, closes: #454615).
  * Included stdlib.h, stdio.h and string.h headers while building common_test
    application driver to fix implicit declaration warnings.
  * Added explicit -lc to libraries list to fix lintian complain about static
    linking.
  * Reordered manpage sections in MANSECT environment variable (put 3erl to
    the front) to minimize probability of getting unexpected manpage using
    erl -man (closes: #458744).
  * Added patch by Mikael Pettersson to fix HiPE enabled build on i386
    architecture.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in gcc-4.2 which caused FTBFS on m68k.
  * Added homepage header to debian/control.
  * Switched to a dependency on the default tk package instead of tk8.4.
  * Added a check for error condition when stopping erlang-based services on
    erlang-base or erlang-base-hipe upgrades (closes: #462138).
  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a hack to prevent crashes during networking operations on m68k
    architecture.
  * Fixed checking for floating point exceptions on i386 architecture
    (closes: #456868).
  * Added extra check for existence of pgrep to make prerm script working on
    hurd-i386 architecture.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undefined BSD4_4 in os_mon application port driver memsup for hurd-i386
    architecture.
  * Skipped building SSL certificate examples on hurd-i386 architecture
    because it has no a random translator.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-10) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Enabled IPv6 in ssl_esock (closes: #449304).
  * Copied real manual pages for user commands from erlang-manpages package
    (closes: #449100).
  * Renamed /usr/bin/start to /usr/bin/start_embedded to prevent possible
    confusion with /usr/bin/startx (closes: #449099).
  * Relaxed suggested packages (removed versioned suggests) in debian/control.
  * Adjusted HiPE architecture from ppc64 to ppc if 32-bit code is generated
    (closes: #451505).
  * Commented out native.diff in debian/patches/series because native code
    requires more memory resources if the package without HiPE is used. Those
    who want to enable native code may uncomment it and rebuild the package.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added a patch which allows to build Erlang with HiPE on i386 architecture
    with glibc 2.7.
  * Build all modules with native code on architectures where HiPE is enabled.
    This increases their size more than two times but gives a significant
    performance gain for CPU-intensive tasks.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added alternative dependency of erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe on hurd
    to make them installable on hurd-i386 architecture.
  * Forced build of beam_emu.c with -O0 optimization option on mips/mipsel
    architectures to bypass a bug in GCC 4.2 (thanks to Martin Michlmayr for
    this workaround).

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson which fixes building of SCTP support
    with libsctp-dev 1.0.7, and enabled SCTP for Linux architectures
    (closes: #436258).
  * Unconditionally required using clock_gettime for time correction on Linux
    architectures. As a result, the package will not build and work on 2.4
    kernels.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a script which prints out dots during dialyzer persistent lookup
    table creating. This prevents build timeouts in buildd on a slow machines.
  * Added build-dependency on bison.
  * Fixed a small error in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weakened dependency of erlang-x11 on tk8.4 to Recommends since this
    package is useful even without X-Window system.
  * Weakened dependencies of erlang on erlang-src, erlang-examples and
    erlang-mode to make the package more robust in unstable during build
    cycles.
  * Moved several forgotten source directories to erlang-src.
  * Rewritten clean target in debian/rules to ignore only missing Makefile
    error.
  * Made clean-patched target in debian/rules depend on patch-stamp.
  * Moved erlang-nox and erlang-x11 menu items from Apps to Applications
    section.
  * Overridden lintian warning desktop-command-not-in-package since
    /usr/bin/erl is included into a package on which erlang-nox depends.
  * Fixed cleanup patch.
  * Added patch which defines MAXHOSTNAMELEN. It is harmless on all Linux
    architectures, but fixes orber building on hurd-i386.
  * Redefined HOME environment variable to fix Erlang compiler warnings in
    case when HOME points to an existent inaccessible directory.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip dialyzer during the second (HiPE enabled) build to save build time.
  * Do not build erlang-base-hipe package on arm architecture since only
    big-endian ARM mode is supported. As a result, patch 31arm.diff is
    removed.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org> to uploaders list.
  * Linked /usr/share/man to /usr/lib/erlang directory and added support for
    compressed manual pages to Erlang mode. This allows to read manual pages
    using Erlang mode for Emacs (closes: #436044).
  * Added patch which helps to reveal certain build failures (the author is
    Christian Faulhammer).
  * Overridden lintian warnings about shell script skeletons in megaco
    examples directory.
  * Bumped debhelper compatibility level to 5.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Linked openssl libraries dynamically instead of new default static linking
    which causes difficulties with security updates.

erlang (1:11.b.5dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed using incorrect original tarball in previous version. (Also,
    dfsg suffix indicates changes with respect to original distribution.)
  * Added a check for prebuilt binaries and non-free docs to debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release (fixes FTBFS with glibc 2.6, closes: #434342).
  * Removed patch which fixed Delete key binding in Erlang mode for emacs
    since it is included into upstream distribution.
  * Added build-arch and build-indep targets to debian/rules (they are
    equivalent to build target since the whole build is required to create
    architecture-dependent and architecture-independent packages).

erlang (1:11.b.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe provide virtual package
    erlang-abi-11.b.3 (the number means the first erlang version, which
    provides current ABI). Its version must be changed after any changes
    in ABI made by upstream. Also added ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution
    variable to erlang-depends script.
  * Added Erlang homepage to debian/control.
  * Removed lintian override files for erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe
    since they are no longer needed. Also, removed override for
    binary-without-manpage from erlang-x11.lintian-override.
  * Converted erlang-nox and erlang-x11 to architecture-any packages and
    moved all relevant binaries from erlang-base to these packages.
  * Made erlang-base (and erlang-base-hipe) suggest erlang-nox and erlang-x11
    instead of recommending because the default aptitude behavior is to
    install recommended packages. This avoids installing X window system when
    only some server application is needed (ejabberd, yaws etc.).
  * Fixed binary-arch and binary-indep targets dependencies in debian/rules.

erlang (1:11.b.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed cleanup after package build (closes: #424198).
  * Applied patch by Mikael Magnusson, which adds IPv6 support to ssl
    application (closes: #413401).

erlang (1:11.b.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Replaced `ps` by `pgrep` in prerm scripts to make them more clear.
  * Added dependency on procps package because `pgrep` is used in prerm
    scripts and procps is not an essential package (closes: #417413).
  * Updated TODO.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release R11B-4.
  * Added stub manual page for escript.

erlang (1:11.b.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Change header of erlang-depends(1) man page.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed FTBFS on m68k architecture.
  * Documented RSA derived code license in debian/copyright
    (closes: #405360).
  * Switched to quilt for patch management
  * Switched to conventional source:Version, binary:Version and
    source:Upstream-Version substvars (thus making porting to sarge
    nontrivial).
  * Added flex build-dependency (it is needed by megaco application).
  * Added autoconf2.13 to Build-Conflicts because if it is present then
    it is used instead of autoconf 2.50 and fails.
  * Fixed clause arrows syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs
    (closes: #413052).
  * Fixed $' and $" patterns syntax highlighting in Erlang mode for Emacs.

erlang (1:11.b.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Fixed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts.

erlang (1:11.b.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Introduce erlang-depends to calculate ${erlang-*:Depends} for packages
    that Build-Depend on erlang.
  * Setting urgency to medium because this revision does not change any
    existing functionality but it is important for future backports to etch.

erlang (1:11.b.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added IPv6 name resolution patch by Mikael Magnusson (closes: #399628)

erlang (1:11.b.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removed /dev/epoll support patch. Now /dev/epoll is supported
    out-of-the-box.
  * Optimized erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm and postinst
    scripts (thanks to Aaron M. Ucko, closes: #394379).
  * Changed erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe prerm scripts to stop
    erlang-based services on 'remove in-favour' operation and postinst
    scripts to start the services on any 'configure' operation. It
    makes upgrading when conflicting erlang-doc-html is installed or
    replacing erlang-base by erlang-base-hipe (or vice versa) correct.
  * Added stub manual pages for all utilities, which are placed to
    /usr/bin/, with reference to erlang-manpages package.
  * Added conflict with erlang-manpages <= 1:11.b.1-2 because of
    added stub manpages.

erlang (1:11.b.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Removed non-free documentation from the upstream source and added
    dfsg suffix to version number (closes: #393367).
  * Removed conflicts with erlang-doc-html from all packages except
    erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe.
  * Removed conflicts with erlang binary packages from all packages
    (made them just replace earlier versions).
  * Added erlang-src, erlang-examples, and erlang-mode dependency on
    erlang-base (or erlang-base-hipe). It's done only for easier
    packaging.
  * Moved overriding config.sub and config.guess from dpatch
    to debian/rules.
  * Bind Backspace key in Erlang mode for Emacs and XEmacs differently
    (closes: #388851).
  * Added description to all patches in debian/patches.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * Set urgency to medium, because we are fixing a RC bug.

erlang (1:11.b.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * New upstream version.
  * Removed 43beam_makeopts.dpatch as it is included in upstream.
  * Overridden lintian complain about missing manual page for dialyzer
    (it is available from erlang-manpages package).
  * Made "make clean" not removing bootstrap files. Otherwise the second
    build cannot be successful.
  * Changed dependencies on erlang-base and erlang-base-hipe to allow
    binary-only NMUs.

  [ Torsten Werner ]
  * add SVN id in README.Debian.

erlang (1:11.b.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Made odbc driver build on 64-bit architectures.
  * Added debian/watch control file.
  * Added link from /usr/lib/erlang/include/driver.h to /usr/include
    (it seems not to conflict with other packages).
  * Disabled optimization for m68k (both -O1 and -O2 do not work,
    see bug #378599).

erlang (1:11.b.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sergei Golovan ]
  * Added odbc application building (with unixodbc dependency).

  * Merged changes from erlang 1:10.b.10-3, namely:

  * Replaced ibm-linux by ibm-linux-gnu in config.guess.
  * Use -O1 optimization flag for m68k (workaround for bug in GCC, but there
    are still bugs in glibc, so it's unlikely to build erlang on m68k).
  * Corrected erlang-dev short description.
  * Corrected erlang-src.patterns (moved non-source gs application files to
    erlan…

## Description

An issue was discovered in Erlang/OTP 18.x. Erlang's generation of compiled regular expressions is vulnerable to a heap overflow. Regular expressions using a malformed extpattern can indirectly specify an offset that is used as an array index. This ordinal permits arbitrary regions within the erts\_alloc arena to be both read and written to.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Details

It was discovered that the Erlang FTP module incorrectly handled certain

CRLF sequences. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject

arbitrary FTP commands. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-1693](/security/CVE-2014-1693))

It was discovered that Erlang incorrectly checked CBC padding bytes. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle

attack and decrypt traffic. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2015-2774](/security/CVE-2015-2774))

It was discovered that Erlang incorrectly handled certain regular

expressions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Erlang to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary

code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-10253](/security/CVE-2016-10253))

Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young discovered that the Erlang

otp TLS server incorrectly handled error reporting. A remote attacker could

possibly use this issue to perform a variation of the Bleichenbacher attack

and decrypt traffic or sign messages. ([CVE-2017-1000385](/security/CVE-2017-1000385))
