Based on the provided changelog, the following vulnerabilities were addressed in the Icegram Engage plugin:

**1. Multiple XSS vulnerabilities**

*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data, allowing execution of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the plugin's interface, potentially leading to user session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Through plugin settings, message creation or other input fields.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious code through plugin options.

**2. Missing authorization and nonce checks when duplicating a message.**

*   **Root cause:** Inadequate access control and lack of security checks when duplicating messages.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), missing authorization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially duplicate messages they should not have access to or modify messages without proper authorization.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the message duplication functionality.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Authenticated access with insufficient privileges.

**3. Missing authentication & authorization checks when previewing campaign.**

*   **Root cause:** Inadequate security checks in the campaign preview feature.
*   **Weaknesses:** Authentication bypass, missing authorization.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could preview campaigns that they should not have access to.
*   **Attack vectors:** Directly accessing the campaign preview functionality.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to access the preview functionality.

**4. Security issue in the gallery**

*   **Root cause:** Not specified, but likely related to the handling of gallery data or functionality.
*    **Weaknesses:** Not specified, but likely XSS or other data handling issue.
*   **Impact:** Not specified, but may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of gallery content.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the gallery functionality.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to interact with the gallery.

**5.  Improved security related to nonce in Settings and Subscription form**

*   **Root cause:**  Inadequate nonce usage.
*   **Weaknesses:**  CSRF vulnerability.
*    **Impact:** Could potentially lead to unauthorized modification of settings or form submissions.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Exploiting the settings or form submission process.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious request.

**6. Secured Icegram Engage from Stored XSS vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of stored data.
*   **Weaknesses:** Stored XSS.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that get stored in the plugin's database and executed when viewed by other users.
*   **Attack vectors:** Through various plugin input fields, settings, messages.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious code and store it in the plugin.

**7. Secured Icegram Engage from reflected XSS vulnerability**
*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of user input reflected back in the response.
*   **Weaknesses:** Reflected XSS.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that get executed in the victim's browser when accessing the affected page
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted URLs to the victim.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious request.

The changelog entries indicate that these vulnerabilities were primarily reported by Patchstack and WPScan teams, and were addressed through security fixes and improvements.
