Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10711

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a request smuggling issue within the Pound reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTPS front-end.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Request Smuggling:** Pound improperly handles specially crafted HTTP requests, potentially interpreting them differently than the backend server. This discrepancy allows an attacker to manipulate how requests are processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Partial Cache Poisoning:** Attackers could manipulate cached content.
- **Bypassing Firewall Protection:** Crafted requests could bypass security measures.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability could facilitate XSS attacks.
- **CPU exhaustion:**  A regression in the fix could allow a specially crafted request to cause 100% CPU usage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to Pound.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Pound server.
- No specific user privileges on the target system are mentioned. The attacker can be an external client sending the malicious request

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in pound versions: 2.6-2+deb7u2 (for Debian 7),  2.6-6+deb8u2 (for Debian 8), and 2.6-6+deb8u3 (to address a regression of the fix in Debian 8)
- The vulnerability is described as a request smuggling vulnerability.
