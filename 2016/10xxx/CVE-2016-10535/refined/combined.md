### @twolfson **[twolfson](/twolfson)** commented [Feb 3, 2016](#issue-130876771)

The string comparison currently used in `csrf-lite` is susceptible to a timing attack (e.g. attacker can detect millisecond changes by Node.js short circuiting string comparison). To mitigate that attack, we can use a time constant string comparison.

In this PR:

* Moved from `===` to `scmp` for time constant string comparison

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Retrospectively, this should have been reported to Node Security Project first. We have done it as an after thought but sorry for the immediate public disclosure =( |
