Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Multisite Post Duplicator plugin lacked proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when duplicating content between sites on a WordPress multisite installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The core issue is the absence of proper CSRF tokens or checks in the plugin's duplication functionality. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by a logged-in administrator without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML into the site's content. This can be used for:
    *   **Defacement:**  Altering the visual appearance of the website.
    *   **Credential Harvesting:**  Stealing login credentials from authenticated users through malicious forms or scripts.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** Performing virtually any action an admin user can do, such as creating new admin users, modifying site settings, etc.
*   **Viewing Unpublished Content:** An attacker could potentially copy and view content that was not intended to be public yet by changing the post status of duplicated content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited through a CSRF attack, where a malicious request is sent to the server using the session of an authenticated user.
*   **Malicious HTML form:**  The attacker needs to create a form and trick a logged-in admin into submitting it. This form will contain the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Target User Logged In:** The attacker needs a logged-in administrator to be tricked into submitting their malicious request.
*   **Knowledge of Site Structure:**  The attacker needs some knowledge of the site structure, specifically post IDs, blog IDs, and any other necessary parameters to craft the malicious request (though some can be guessed or brute forced).
*   **Ability to host/send a malicious form**: The attacker needs the ability to send the malicious HTML form to the targeted admin user or host it on a site that the user can access.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker could use a crafted form to perform the duplication. The form includes hidden inputs that contain parameters for the plugin, like post status, a prefix, the action to take, the element (post) to duplicate, and target blog ID.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on November 1, 2016, and a fix was implemented in version 1.1.3, which was released after December 7, 2016.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was present in version 0.9.5.1 of the plugin.
