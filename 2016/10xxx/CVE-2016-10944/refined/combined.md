## FAQ

Installation Instructions

1. Upload `multisite-post-duplicator` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Customise the default behaviour by going to Setting > Multisite Post Duplicator Settings

Does this only work on a multisite network?

Yes.

Can I copy custom post types?

Yes.

What about post meta? Will these be copied over?

Yes.

Does this work with advanced custom fields?

Yes. However, you have to have the same custom fields defined in each of the sites on your network. To help keep the fields in sync try: https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-multisite-sync/

What about Multisites on Subdomain Configurations?

Unfortunately we don’t support sub domain configurations at this time. You may use it to some extent, but a lot of this plugins features may produce unexpected results. Our plan is to introduce support for this in the near future.

I had a big problem to synchronize custom posts with images that require ID no solution was able to solve until I arrived at this plugin and as a simple magic trick everything was solved.
Thank you, I will buy you a beer and DO NOT stop the development.

Do not install or use this plugin! He has already knocked down 2 times my server by duplicating posts in multisite. Do not use it!

It could be nice if the copied posts could link back to the original posts

This plugin is so helpful. Perfect solution.
I tried to move custom post type (200 articles) on Main site to Sub site/ Multisite.
This plugin can copy many custom posts to Sub site by only one click on admin panel.
You don’t need a difficult operation, edit files, import & export, migration plugin, any.
Just click !
If you have problem “max\_execution\_time”, please edit php.ini. > 30 secound.
Thank you very much. You save me !

## Advisory:

# CSRF vulnerability in Multisite Post Duplicator could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can do

## Vulnerability

Last revised: December 9, 2016

Contains a CSRF vulnerability which can copy content from one site of a multisite installation to another.

This could be used to add arbitrary HTML to the front-end of the site (which could be used for defacement, harvesting login credentials from authenticated users, or could be used to do virtually anything a logged-in admin user can do).

This could also be used to view content not meant to be published.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 5.8 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | Partial |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | None |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

Some of these values may need adjusting depending on the post IDs, blog IDs, etc.
