# OpenSSH < 7.4 - 'UsePrivilegeSeparation Disabled' Forwarded Unix Domain Sockets Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 40962

#### CVE:

###### [2016-10010](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10010)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1010

This issue affects OpenSSH if privilege separation is disabled (config option
UsePrivilegeSeparation=no). While privilege separation is enabled by default, it
is documented as a hardening option, and therefore disabling it should not
directly make a system vulnerable.

OpenSSH can forward TCP sockets and UNIX domain sockets. If privilege separation
is disabled, then on the server side, the forwarding is handled by a child of
sshd that has root privileges. For TCP server sockets, sshd explicitly checks
whether an attempt is made to bind to a low port (below IPPORT_RESERVED) and, if
so, requires the client to authenticate as root. However, for UNIX domain
sockets, no such security measures are implemented.

This means that, using "ssh -L", an attacker who is permitted to log in as a
normal user over SSH can effectively connect to non-abstract unix domain sockets
with root privileges. On systems that run systemd, this can for example be
exploited by asking systemd to add an LD_PRELOAD environment variable for all
following daemon launches and then asking it to restart cron or so. The attached
exploit demonstrates this - if it is executed on a system with systemd where
the user is allowed to ssh to his own account and where privsep is disabled, it
yields a root shell.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssh-7.4p1-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.   This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.   ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside     a trusted whitelist.   sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain     sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.   sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to     privilege-separated child processes via realloc().   sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression     support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising     compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.     process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.   sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at     configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.

OpenSSH 7.4 was released on 2016-12-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
http://www.openssh.com/donations.html
Future deprecation notice
=========================
We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:
\* In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).
\* In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).
\* Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
is 768 bits)
\* The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
with privilege separation disabled.
\* The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.
This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.
Potentially-incompatible changes
================================
This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:
\* This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.
\* ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
anyway.
\* sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.
\* ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
at run-time.
\* sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
error-prone.
\* sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
for having /bin/login manage login sessions.
Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================
This is primarily a bugfix release.
Security
--------
\* ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
(Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.
\* sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
optimisation identification tool (http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/)
\* sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.
\* sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
Reported by Laurence Parry.
New Features
------------
\* ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
IDs, etc. This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
"ssh -O proxy ..."
\* sshd(8): Add a sshd\_config DisableForwarding option that disables
X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
'restrict' authorized\_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
and future-proof way of restricting an account.
\* sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
"curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".
\* sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
the case of a configuration error. bz#2641
\* sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
directives to appear in sshd\_config Match blocks.
\* sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
contents of the certificate being offered.
\* Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
string sanitisation functions.
\* Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.
Bugfixes
--------
\* ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
certificate id\_rsa-cert.pub (and no id\_rsa.pub).
\* ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
method attempted. bz#2642
\* regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. bz#2639
\* ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to load
keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
detail in debug messages. bz#2610
\* ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.
\* sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the terminal mode
correctly if suspended during a password prompt.
\* ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a password
prompt.
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
info messages.
\* sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
sequence NEWKEYS message.
\* sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547
\* sshd(8): Fix sending ext\_info message if privsep is disabled.
\* sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
in the configuration
\* sshd(8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.
\* Fix false positive reports caused by explicit\_bzero(3) not being
recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
-fsanitize-memory.
\* sshd\_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
configuration examples.
Portability
-----------
\* On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. bz#2643
\* sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
ptrace(PT\_DENY\_ATTACH, ..)
\* ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.
\* Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.
\* contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640
\* sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
sandboxing.
\* All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
if we're cross compiling.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-4000

The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite is enabled on a server but not on
a client, does not properly convey a DHE_EXPORT choice, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with DHE replaced by DHE_EXPORT
and then rewriting a ServerHello with DHE_EXPORT replaced by DHE, aka the “Logjam” issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 7.4 released

OpenSSH 7.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
   SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running sshd(8)
   with privilege separation disabled.

 * The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
   OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.

 * ssh(1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
   block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
   attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
   only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
   connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
   but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
   configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
   anyway.

 * sshd(8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
   in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
   cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
   attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
   default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.

 * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
   of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
   at run-time.

 * sshd(8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
   an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
   refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
   The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
   forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
   error-prone.

 * sshd(8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
   for having /bin/login manage login sessions.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
   outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
   load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
   could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
   agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
   result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
   attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
   running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
   of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
   client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
   domain sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of
   'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
   Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
   (Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
   Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
   privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
   keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
   nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
   to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
   compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
   some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
   incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
   disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
   privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
   process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
   This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
   from sshd(8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
   optimisation identification tool (<http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/>)

 * sshd(8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
   sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
   connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.

 * sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
   directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
   ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
   ranges (e.g. user@....1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
   possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
   Reported by Laurence Parry.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to ssh(1) inspired by the
   version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
   client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
   the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
   with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
   IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
   lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
   code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
   forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
   different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
   "ssh -O proxy ..."

 * sshd(8): Add a sshd_config DisableForwaring option that disables
   X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
   as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
   'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
   and future-proof way of restricting an account.

 * sshd(8), ssh(1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
   method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
   "curve25519-sha256@...ssh.org".

 * sshd(8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
   already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
   if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of sshd(8) will
   retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. sshd(8) will
   also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
   it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
   the case of a configuration error. bz#2641

 * sshd(8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
   directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.

 * sshd(8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
   those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
   fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
   contents of the certificate being offered.

 * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
   string sanitisation functions.

 * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
   certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. bz#2617
   certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).

 * ssh(1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
   authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
   method attempted. bz#2642

 * regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. bz#2639

 * ssh-agent(1), ssh(1): improve reporting when attempting to load
   keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
   detail in debug messages. bz#2610

 * ssh(1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
   pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.

 * sftp(1): On ^Z wait for underlying ssh(1) to suspend before
   suspending sftp(1) to ensure that ssh(1) restores the terminal mode
   correctly if suspended during a password prompt.

 * ssh(1): Avoid busy-wait when ssh(1) is suspended during a password
   prompt.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
   info messages.

 * sshd(8): fix NULL-deref crash if sshd(8) received an out-of-
   sequence NEWKEYS message.

 * sshd(8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
   the server-sig-algs extension. bz#2547

 * sshd(8): Fix sending ext_info message if privsep is disabled.

 * sshd(8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
   separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
   only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
   in the configuration

 * sshd(8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
   on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.

 * Fix false positive reports caused by explicit_bzero(3) not being
   recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
   -fsanitize-memory.

 * sshd_config(5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
   configuration examples.

Portability
-----------

 * On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
   C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
   that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. bz#2643

 * sftp-server(8), ssh-agent(1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
   ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, ..)

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.

 * Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.

 * contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. bz#2640

 * sshd(8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
   force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
   sandboxing.

 * All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
   and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
   OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
   years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
   if we're cross compiling.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-17:01.openssh Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: OpenSSH multiple vulnerabilities
Category: contrib
Module: OpenSSH
Announced: 2017-01-11
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2017-01-11 05:56:40 UTC (stable/11, 11.0-STABLE)
2017-01-11 06:01:23 UTC (releng/11.0, 11.0-RELEASE-p7)
2017-01-11 05:56:40 UTC (stable/10, 10.3-STABLE)
2017-01-11 06:01:23 UTC (releng/10.3, 10.3-RELEASE-p16)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-10009, CVE-2016-10010
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite, providing an
encrypted and authenticated transport for a variety of services,
including remote shell access.
OpenSSH supports accessing keys provided by a PKCS#11 token.
II. Problem Description
The ssh-agent(1) agent supports loading a PKCS#11 module from outside a
trusted whitelist. An attacker can request loading of a PKCS#11 module
across forwarded agent-socket. [CVE-2016-10009]
When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix domain sockets
would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root' instead of
the authenticated user. [CVE-2016-10010]
III. Impact
A remote attacker who have control of a forwarded agent-socket on a
remote system and have the ability to write files on the system
running ssh-agent(1) agent can run arbitrary code under the same user
credential. Because the attacker must already have some control on
both systems, it is relatively hard to exploit this vulnerability in
a practical attack. [CVE-2016-10009]
When privilege separation is disabled (on FreeBSD, privilege separation
is enabled by default and has to be explicitly disabled), an authenticated
attacker can potentially gain root privileges on systems running OpenSSH
server. [CVE-2016-10010]
IV. Workaround
Systems not running ssh-agent(1) and sshd(8) services are not affected.
System administrators may remove ssh-agent(1) to mitigate CVE-2016-10009.
System administrators should enable privilege separation when running
OpenSSH server, which is the FreeBSD default, to mitigate CVE-2016-10010.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:01/openssh.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssh.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Kill all running ssh-agent(1) process and restart sshd(8) service.
A reboot is recommended but not required.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/10/ r311915
releng/10.3/ r311916
stable/11/ r311915
releng/11.0/ r311916
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:
