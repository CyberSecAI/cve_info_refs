  "cveId": "CVE-2016-10255",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "elfutils memory allocation failure in __libelf_set_rawdata_wrlock (elf_getdata.c)",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing sanity check on the size of ELF sections before attempting to allocate memory for them. Specifically, the `__libelf_set_rawdata_wrlock` function in `elf_getdata.c` does not validate the size of the section header's `sh_size` field before allocating memory. If this value is excessively large, the memory allocation will fail, leading to a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Memory allocation failure",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted ELF file with an extremely large section size can cause `elfutils` to attempt a huge memory allocation, leading to a crash or resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Malicious ELF file"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted ELF file with a large section size to trigger the vulnerability. No specific position or capabilities are needed apart from the ability to supply this file to be processed by elfutils."
