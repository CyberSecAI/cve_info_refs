  "CVE-2016-10155": {
    "description": "Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' support is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a device unplug operation; Doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host memory, affecting other services on the host.\n\nA privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.",
    "root_cause": "Memory leak in the virtual hardware watchdog 'wdt_i6300esb' when doing a device unplug operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside the guest can cause a denial of service (DoS) and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host by repeatedly unplugging the watchdog device, leading to host memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Device unplug operation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A privileged user inside the guest OS is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
