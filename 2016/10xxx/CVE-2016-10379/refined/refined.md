The provided content discusses SQL injection vulnerabilities in the com_virtuemart component, specifically version 3.0.14. The blog post details the discovery of multiple SQL injection points and provides proof-of-concept code, which directly relates to CVE-2016-10379.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, parameters such as `virtuemart_paymentmethod_id` and `virtuemart_shipmentmethod_id` are directly injected into SQL queries without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsafe concatenation of user-controlled input into SQL queries. The blog post specifically targets the `virtuemart_paymentmethod_id` and `virtuemart_shipmentmethod_id` parameters.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Although there's a mention of an *escape()* function, this function is used for XSS prevention and does not protect against SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This allows them to potentially:
    - Retrieve sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, customer data).
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially take full control of the database and the application if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the web application with crafted values in the vulnerable parameters, such as `virtuemart_paymentmethod_id` and `virtuemart_shipmentmethod_id`.
- The blog post shows examples of vulnerable queries and how to inject malicious SQL code into the parameters using HTTP requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application, and no specific authentication was mentioned as required to perform the attack.
- A black-box methodology was used, meaning the attacker did not need access to the application's source code to discover and exploit the vulnerability.
