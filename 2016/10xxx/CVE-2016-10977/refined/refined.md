Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10977

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. The `nelio-ab-testing` plugin uses external input (`$_POST['filename']`) to construct a pathname, intending to access a file within a specific directory. However, it fails to neutralize special elements within this pathname (e.g., `../`), allowing an attacker to traverse outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. By manipulating the `filename` parameter, an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize the `filename` parameter before using it in a `require_once()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data like configuration files, database credentials, or other critical information.
*   **Security Mechanism Bypass:** If a targeted file is related to security mechanisms, the attacker may be able to bypass these mechanisms. In the provided example, the attacker successfully retrieves the contents of `/etc/passwd` demonstrating the ability to access system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   **`filename` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `filename` parameter in the POST data to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`).
*  **`classname` Parameter:**  The `classname` parameter is also included in the post request, in the example this is set to 'NelioABExperimentsPageController'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`) and the required parameters (`action`, `filename`, and `classname`).
*   **HTTP Request Construction:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `nelio-ab-testing/includes/admin/admin-controller.php` within the `generate_html_content()` function. The code directly includes the file specified by the user-controlled `$file` variable without proper sanitization:

```php
public function generate_html_content() {
    if ( isset( $_POST['filename'] ) && isset( $_POST['classname'] ) ) {
        $file  = $_POST['filename'];
        $class = $_POST['classname'];
        require_once( $file );
        call_user_func( array ( $class, 'generate_html_content' ) );
    }
}
```
The provided `curl` command in the 'Steps to reproduce' section shows how the attacker can exploit the vulnerability, reading `/etc/passwd`.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects version 4.4.4 of the `nelio-ab-testing` plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.5.0.
*   The vendor was notified on 2016-03-27 and released a fix on 2016-04-08.
*   The public disclosure occurred on 2016-05-10.
