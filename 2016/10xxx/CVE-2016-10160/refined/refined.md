Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2016-10160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an off-by-one memory corruption within the `phar_parse_pharfile` function in the PHP source code. This occurs during the parsing of a specially crafted PHAR archive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Off-by-one error: A memory corruption vulnerability exists because a null byte terminator is written one byte beyond the allocated buffer when an alias in a PHAR archive does not match the expected value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting the memory corruption flaw.
- Denial-of-service (DoS): A less severe impact could be a denial of service attack, possibly through memory corruption causing an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious PHAR archive.
- This archive can be loaded remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable application to load the malicious PHAR archive. This can be done by tricking a user into processing such an archive, or by finding an exploitable entry point in a web application.
- No specific attacker capabilities or position is specified other than the ability to deliver the malicious phar archive to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in PHP versions prior to 5.6.30 and 7.0.x before 7.0.15.
- The provided information comes from multiple sources, including Debian security advisory, Red Hat security advisory, and Tenable's vulnerability database, providing some overlap and potentially additional context about the vulnerability
- The Debian Security Advisory indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- Red Hat's advisory indicates a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score of 9.8 (CRITICAL) for this vulnerability.
- Tenable's analysis also considers the vulnerability to be "critical" and lists a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8.

In summary, CVE-2016-10160 represents a serious vulnerability due to the possibility of arbitrary remote code execution. The vulnerability stems from an off-by-one error in PHP's handling of PHAR archive aliases, making it important to apply the necessary patches.
