### @matt- **[matt-](/matt-)** commented [May 19, 2015](#issue-78266927)

With the sanitize option on it is possible to create a link with a javascript: protocol with the following: `[URL](javascript&#58document;alert&#40;1&#41;)`.

HTML entities in the browser are not strict and parse what they can and leaving the rest behind. For example `&#xNNanything;` would parse the NN hex values but leave behind the string "anything;".

"`javascript&#58document;`" with the regex `/&([#\w]+);/` returns "`58document`" and is parsed by String.fromCharCode to "". Because of this the later tests only sees the javascript keyword without the :. However the browser parses this to: "`javascript:document;`".

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@matt-](https://github.com/matt-) Remarkable looks great (very very clean) but it's about 6x the size of Marked. For some use-cases (client-side) it seems like Marked would be preferable on those grounds (though for anything else I'm probably going to be using remarkable given the focus on performance). |

The exact example you gave is the XSS issue. (Put that HTML in a browser and click on it.) javascript: (in any form even with html entities) should be blocked in sanitize mode.  Example where marked works correctly:  ``` > var md = require("marked"); > md.setOptions({sanitize: true}) > md("[URL](javascript:alert&#40;1&#41;)"); '<p></p>\n'  ```  Example this PR resolves with bad entities:  ``` > var md = require("marked"); > md.setOptions({sanitize: true}) > md("[URL](javascript&#58document;alert&#40;1&#41;)"); '<p><a href="javascript&#58document;alert&#40;1&#41;">URL</a></p>\n'  ```  If you think this is still some how resolved please read this blog to better understand the issue: <https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/> |

| From the first sentence in this PR: "With the sanitize option on" This lib has a sanitize mode that is intended to block normal HTML and prevent xss. <https://github.com/chjj/marked#sanitize>  It also filters "javascript:" and "vbscript:" as intended in this mode. This is an example of bypassing that with html entities.  Executing javascript (an XSS) is much MUCH worse than "plain old hyperlinks". This is an abandoned project with an open and very clear security issue.. not exactly what I consider FUD. |
