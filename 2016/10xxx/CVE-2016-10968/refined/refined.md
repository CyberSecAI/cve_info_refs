Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The PeepSo plugin implemented its own AJAX handler, allowing any function derived from `PeepSoAjaxCallback` to be called by any logged-in user. The `PeepSoProfilePreferencesAjax->save()` function lacked sufficient input sanitization, allowing users to modify their own account metadata using unfiltered user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `PeepSoProfilePreferencesAjax->save()` function didn't properly validate or sanitize user-provided meta keys.
- **Lack of Access Control:** While the function restricted modifications to the user's own account, it didn't prevent modification of sensitive meta keys.
- **Custom AJAX Handler Risk:** The custom AJAX handler implementation required developers to be extra careful when adding functionality, which wasn't the case for this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A logged-in user could gain administrative privileges by manipulating the `wp_capabilities` meta key to grant themselves administrator roles, allowing complete control over the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted AJAX request to the `PeepSoProfilePreferencesAjax->save()` function.
- **Meta Data Manipulation:** The attacker uses this request to modify user account meta data, including setting `wp_capabilities` to admin privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable plugin version is PeepSo <= 1.6.0.
- The vulnerability was reported and patched quickly by the developers.
- The fix involved restricting the meta keys that can be updated by the `save()` function.
- The vulnerability is present because the custom AJAX handler and the lack of proper validation in the `save()` function allowed unfiltered user input.
