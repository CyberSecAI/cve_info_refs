{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of hostname verification during HTTPS requests on Windows platforms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The absence of hostname verification when establishing HTTPS connections allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.",
      "Failure to validate the server's hostname against the certificate provided, enabling attackers to use any valid CA-issued certificate regardless of hostname mismatches."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful MitM attack could allow the attacker to intercept, modify, or eavesdrop on encrypted communications between a client and server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks exploiting the lack of hostname verification in HTTPS requests."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
       "The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path of communication."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing hostname verification using the rust-openssl crate's built-in support."
