Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10713:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds access within the `pch_write_line()` function in the `pch.c` file of the `patch` utility.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to access `p_line[line][p_len[line] - 1]` without checking if `p_len[line]` is greater than 0, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory if `p_len[line]` is 0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted patch file could trigger the out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash of the `patch` utility. This can disrupt services that depend on patching functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Patch File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted patch file that, when processed by the vulnerable `patch` utility, triggers the out-of-bounds read within `pch_write_line()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted patch file to the vulnerable system and induce the `patch` utility to process it.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned as needed. The vulnerability can be triggered if the `patch` utility is used to apply the crafted patch file, regardless of the user running `patch`.

**Additional details:**
- Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1545405 provides additional context, including the upstream fix commit on GNU's git repository.
- Ubuntu Security Notices USN-3624-1 and USN-3624-2 indicate that Ubuntu was affected and provided patches to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a *Low* severity in Red Hat's advisory, this is in part because the issue requires a specially crafted patch file, and the impact is DoS and not code execution.

In summary, CVE-2016-10713 is a vulnerability in the `patch` utility that can be exploited by supplying a crafted patch file, which leads to out-of-bounds memory access and potentially causing a denial-of-service condition.
