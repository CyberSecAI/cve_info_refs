Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `fill_threshhold_buffer()` function within Ghostscript. This occurs due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the `thresh_buffer`. There was a size check for `ht_buffer`, but no size check for `threshold_buffer`, resulting in the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:**  The vulnerability allows writing beyond the allocated memory region on the heap. This occurs in `gxht_thresh.c` and `gxipixel.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash of the application, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, a heap buffer overflow could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if the attacker gains sufficient control over the overflowed memory region.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PostScript File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PostScript file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious PostScript file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PostScript file to a system running a vulnerable version of Ghostscript.
*   **No specific privileges:** No specific privileges are mentioned as being required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found during fuzz testing.
*   The issue was initially found on Linux 64-bit builds and did not affect Windows due to allocation limitations on 32-bit systems.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a size check for the threshold buffer to prevent the overflow.
*   The bug report mentions that this vulnerability was assigned CVE-2016-10317.
