Thanks to Ken for replicating the problem and identifying the system conditions.  Note that I've bumped this up to P2 because it is a buffer overflow. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=697459#c5)  Raphaël Hertzog    2017-04-07 01:06:20 UTC  ``` Is it on purpose that the attachment is private here while it was public for all other reports of Kamil?  Is there any ETA for the fix?  Also the command line in the first comment mentions a reproducer file named "gs_uaf_pdf14_cleanup_parent_color_profiles" but this is unlikely to be the correct name since that function does not appear in the back trace posted in the same comment.  Thank you in advance. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=697459#c6)  Raphaël Hertzog    2017-05-12 01:24:26 UTC  ``` Is there any news? It would be nice to have a patch for this security issue. Thank you! ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=697459#c7)  Marcus Meissner    2017-07-10 07:48:51 UTC  ``` Ping? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=697459#c8)  Ray Johnston    2017-11-21 13:33:36 UTC  ``` This was due to an overflow calculating the size of the thresh_buffer.  Fix awaiting review:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=user/ray/ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=d7e176da004a49305fe3da8127e5fb4f29ccce4b> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=697459#c9)  Ray Johnston    2017-11-21 21:28:28 UTC  ``` Fixed by commit [362ec9daadb9992b0def3520cd1dc6fa52edd1c4](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?362ec9daadb9992b0def3520cd1dc6fa52edd1c4) Author: Ray Johnston <ray.johnston@artifex.com> Date:   Tue Nov 21 12:48:54 2017 -0800      Fix [bug 697459](show_bug.cgi?id=697459 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap buffer overflow in fill_threshhold_buffer()") Buffer overflow in fill_threshold_buffer      There was an overflow check for ht_buffer size, but none for the larger     threshold_buffer. Note that this file didn't fail on Windows because the     combination of the ht_buffer and the size of the (miscalculated due to     overflow) threshold_buffer would have exceeded the 2Gb limit. ``` |  |
