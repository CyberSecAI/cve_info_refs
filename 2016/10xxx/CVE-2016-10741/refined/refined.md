{
  "CVE-2016-10741": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the XFS file system when handling direct I/O reads and memory-mapped writes to the same file region, specifically when delalloc blocks are present. This scenario leads to a BUG_ON() call, which crashes the system.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition, improper handling of delalloc blocks during mixed direct I/O and memory-mapped I/O operations, leading to kernel panic.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (system crash). A local user with write access to an XFS volume can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local. A local user with write access to an XFS volume can trigger the race condition by mixing direct I/O reads and memory-mapped writes to the same region of a file, specifically targeting a hole in the file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with write permissions to an XFS volume."
