xfs: don't BUG() on mixed direct and mapped I/O

```
We've had reports of generic/095 causing XFS to BUG() in
__xfs_get_blocks() due to the existence of delalloc blocks on a
direct I/O read. generic/095 issues a mix of various types of I/O,
including direct and memory mapped I/O to a single file. This is
clearly not supported behavior and is known to lead to such
problems. E.g., the lack of exclusion between the direct I/O and
write fault paths means that a write fault can allocate delalloc
blocks in a region of a file that was previously a hole after the
direct read has attempted to flush/inval the file range, but before
it actually reads the block mapping. In turn, the direct read
discovers a delalloc extent and cannot proceed.

While the appropriate solution here is to not mix direct and memory
mapped I/O to the same regions of the same file, the current
BUG_ON() behavior is probably overkill as it can crash the entire
system.  Instead, localize the failure to the I/O in question by
returning an error for a direct I/O that cannot be handled safely
due to delalloc blocks. Be careful to allow the case of a direct
write to post-eof delalloc blocks. This can occur due to speculative
preallocation and is safe as post-eof blocks are not accompanied by
dirty pages in pagecache (conversely, preallocation within eof must
have been zeroed, and thus dirtied, before the inode size could have
been increased beyond said blocks).

Finally, provide an additional warning if a direct I/O write occurs
while the file is memory mapped. This may not catch all problematic
scenarios, but provides a hint that some known-to-be-problematic I/O
methods are in use.

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

usb: gadget: composite: always set ep->mult to a sensible value
commit eaa496ffaaf19591fe471a36cef366146eeb9153 upstream.
ep->mult is supposed to be set to Isochronous and
Interrupt Endapoint's multiplier value. This value
is computed from different places depending on the
link speed.
If we're dealing with HighSpeed, then it's part of
bits [12:11] of wMaxPacketSize. This case wasn't
taken into consideration before.
While at that, also make sure the ep->mult defaults
to one so drivers can use it unconditionally and
assume they'll never multiply ep->maxpacket to zero.

tick/broadcast: Prevent NULL pointer dereference
commit c1a9eeb938b5433947e5ea22f89baff3182e7075 upstream.
When a disfunctional timer, e.g. dummy timer, is installed, the tick core
tries to setup the broadcast timer.
If no broadcast device is installed, the kernel crashes with a NULL pointer
dereference in tick\_broadcast\_setup\_oneshot() because the function has no
sanity check.

clocksource/dummy\_timer: Move hotplug callback after the real timers
commit 9bf11ecce5a2758e5a097c2f3a13d08552d0d6f9 upstream.
When the dummy timer callback is invoked before the real timer callbacks,
then it tries to install that timer for the starting CPU. If the platform
does not have a broadcast timer installed the installation fails with a
kernel crash. The crash happens due to a unconditional deference of the non
available broadcast device. This needs to be fixed in the timer core code.
But even when this is fixed in the core code then installing the dummy
timer before the real timers is a pointless exercise.
Move it to the end of the callback list.

xfs: fix crash and data corruption due to removal of busy COW extents
commit a1b7a4dea6166cf46be895bce4aac67ea5160fe8 upstream.
There is a race window between write\_cache\_pages calling
clear\_page\_dirty\_for\_io and XFS calling set\_page\_writeback, in which
the mapping for an inode is tagged neither as dirty, nor as writeback.
If the COW shrinker hits in exactly that window we'll remove the delayed
COW extents and writepages trying to write it back, which in release
kernels will manifest as corruption of the bmap btree, and in debug
kernels will trip the ASSERT about now calling xfs\_bmapi\_write with the
COWFORK flag for holes. A complex customer load manages to hit this
window fairly reliably, probably by always having COW writeback in flight
while the cow shrinker runs.
This patch adds another check for having the I\_DIRTY\_PAGES flag set,
which is still set during this race window. While this fixes the problem
I'm still not overly happy about the way the COW shrinker works as it
still seems a bit fragile.

When we create a new attribute, we first create a shortform
attribute, and try to fit the new attribute into it.
If that fails, we copy the (empty) attribute into a leaf attribute,
and do the copy again. Thus there can be a transient state where
we have an empty leaf attribute.
If we encounter this during log replay, the verifier will fail.
So add a test to ignore this part of the leaf attr verification
during log replay.

xfs: clean up cow fork reservation and tag inodes correctly
commit 0260d8ff5f76617e3a55a1c471383ecb4404c3ad upstream.
COW fork reservation is implemented via delayed allocation. The code is
modeled after the traditional delalloc allocation code, but is slightly
different in terms of how preallocation occurs. Rather than post-eof
speculative preallocation, COW fork preallocation is implemented via a
COW extent size hint that is designed to minimize fragmentation as a
reflinked file is split over time.
xfs\_reflink\_reserve\_cow() still uses logic that is oriented towards
dealing with post-eof speculative preallocation, however, and is stale
or not necessarily correct. First, the EOF alignment to the COW extent
size hint is implemented in xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc() (which does so
correctly by aligning the start and end offsets) and so is not necessary
in xfs\_reflink\_reserve\_cow(). The backoff and retry logic on ENOSPC is
also ineffective for the same reason, as xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc()
will simply perform the same allocation request on the retry. Finally,
since the COW extent size hint aligns the start and end offset of the
range to allocate, the end\_fsb != orig\_end\_fsb logic is not sufficient.
Indeed, if a write request happens to end on an aligned offset, it is
possible that we do not tag the inode for COW preallocation even though
xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc() may have preallocated at the start offset.
Kill the unnecessary, duplicate code in xfs\_reflink\_reserve\_cow().
Remove the inode tag logic as well since xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc()
has been updated to tag the inode correctly.

xfs: track preallocation separately in xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc()
commit 974ae922efd93b07b6cdf989ae959883f6f05fd8 upstream.
Speculative preallocation is currently processed entirely by the callers
of xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc(). The caller determines how much
preallocation to include, adjusts the extent length and passes down the
resulting request.
While this works fine for post-eof speculative preallocation, it is not
as reliable for COW fork preallocation. COW fork preallocation is
implemented via the cowextszhint, which aligns the start offset as well
as the length of the extent. Further, it is difficult for the caller to
accurately identify when preallocation occurs because the returned
extent could have been merged with neighboring extents in the fork.
To simplify this situation and facilitate further COW fork preallocation
enhancements, update xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc() to take a separate
preallocation parameter to incorporate into the allocation request. The
preallocation blocks value is tacked onto the end of the request and
adjusted to accommodate neighboring extents and extent size limits.
Since xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc() now knows precisely how much
preallocation was included in the allocation, it can also tag the inodes
appropriately to support preallocation reclaim.
Note that xfs\_bmapi\_reserve\_delalloc() callers are not yet updated to
use the preallocation mechanism. This patch should not change behavior
outside of correctly tagging reflink inodes when start offset
preallocation occurs (which the caller does not handle correctly).

xfs\_iext\_lookup\_extent looks up a single extent at the passed in offset,
and returns the extent covering the area, or the one behind it in case

as well as a simple bool as return value that is set to false if no
extent could be found because the offset is behind EOF. It is a simpler
replacement for xfs\_bmap\_search\_extent that leaves looking up the rarely

xfs\_iext\_get\_extent is a helper for iterating over the extent list,
it takes an extent index as input, and returns the extent at that index
in it's expanded form in an argument if it exists. The actual return
value is a bool whether the index is valid or not.

xfs: fix unbalanced inode reclaim flush locking
commit 98efe8af1c9ffac47e842b7a75ded903e2f028da upstream.
Filesystem shutdown testing on an older distro kernel has uncovered an
imbalanced locking pattern for the inode flush lock in
xfs\_reclaim\_inode(). Specifically, there is a double unlock sequence
between the call to xfs\_iflush\_abort() and xfs\_reclaim\_inode() at the
"reclaim:" label.
This actually does not cause obvious problems on current kernels due to
the current flush lock implementation. Older kernels use a counting
based flush lock mechanism, however, which effectively breaks the lock
indefinitely when an already unlocked flush lock is repeatedly unlocked.
Though this only currently occurs on filesystem shutdown, it has
reproduced the effect of elevating an fs shutdown to a system-wide crash
or hang.
As it turns out, the flush lock is not actually required for the reclaim
logic in xfs\_reclaim\_inode() because by that time we have already cycled
the flush lock once while holding ILOCK\_EXCL. Therefore, remove the
additional flush lock/unlock cycle around the 'reclaim:' label and
update branches into this label to release the flush lock where
appropriate. Add an assert to xfs\_ifunlock() to help prevent future
occurences of the same problem.

xfs: don't BUG() on mixed direct and mapped I/O
commit 04197b341f23b908193308b8d63d17ff23232598 upstream.
We've had reports of generic/095 causing XFS to BUG() in
\_\_xfs\_get\_blocks() due to the existence of delalloc blocks on a
direct I/O read. generic/095 issues a mix of various types of I/O,
including direct and memory mapped I/O to a single file. This is
clearly not supported behavior and is known to lead to such
problems. E.g., the lack of exclusion between the direct I/O and
write fault paths means that a write fault can allocate delalloc
blocks in a region of a file that was previously a hole after the
direct read has attempted to flush/inval the file range, but before
it actually reads the block mapping. In turn, the direct read
discovers a delalloc extent and cannot proceed.
While the appropriate solution here is to not mix direct and memory
mapped I/O to the same regions of the same file, the current
BUG\_ON() behavior is probably overkill as it can crash the entire
system. Instead, localize the failure to the I/O in question by
returning an error for a direct I/O that cannot be handled safely
due to delalloc blocks. Be careful to allow the case of a direct
write to post-eof delalloc blocks. This can occur due to speculative
preallocation and is safe as post-eof blocks are not accompanied by
dirty pages in pagecache (conversely, preallocation within eof must
have been zeroed, and thus dirtied, before the inode size could have
been increased beyond said blocks).
Finally, provide an additional warning if a direct I/O write occurs
while the file is memory mapped. This may not catch all problematic
scenarios, but provides a hint that some known-to-be-problematic I/O
methods are in use.

xfs: don't skip cow forks w/ delalloc blocks in cowblocks scan
commit 399372349a7f9b2d7e56e4fa4467c69822d07024 upstream.
The cowblocks background scanner currently clears the cowblocks tag
for inodes without any real allocations in the cow fork. This
excludes inodes with only delalloc blocks in the cow fork. While we
might never expect to clear delalloc blocks from the cow fork in the
background scanner, it is not necessarily correct to clear the
cowblocks tag from such inodes.
For example, if the background scanner happens to process an inode
between a buffered write and writeback, the scanner catches the
inode in a state after delalloc blocks have been allocated to the
cow fork but before the delalloc blocks have been converted to real
blocks by writeback. The background scanner then incorrectly clears
the cowblocks tag, even if part of the aforementioned delalloc
reservation will not be remapped to the data fork (i.e., extra
blocks due to the cowextsize hint). This means that any such
additional blocks in the cow fork might never be reclaimed by the
background scanner and could persist until the inode itself is
reclaimed.
To address this problem, only skip and clear inodes without any cow
fork allocations whatsoever from the background scanner. While we
generally do not want to cancel delalloc reservations from the
background scanner, the pagecache dirty check following the
cowblocks check should prevent that situation. If we do end up with
delalloc cow fork blocks without a dirty address space mapping, this
is probably an indication that something has gone wrong and the
blocks should be reclaimed, as they may never be converted to a real
allocation.

xfs: don't call xfs\_sb\_quota\_from\_disk twice
commit e6fc6fcf4447c9266038c55c25e4c7c14bee110c upstream.
Source xfsprogs commit: ee3754254e8c186c99b6cdd4d59f741759d04acb
Kernel commit 5ef828c4 ("xfs: avoid false quotacheck after unclean
shutdown") made xfs\_sb\_from\_disk() also call xfs\_sb\_quota\_from\_disk
by default.
However, when this was merged to libxfs, existing separate
calls to libxfs\_sb\_quota\_from\_disk remained, and calling it
twice in a row on a V4 superblock leads to issues, because:
if (sbp->sb\_qflags & XFS\_PQUOTA\_ACCT) {
...
sbp->sb\_pquotino = sbp->sb\_gquotino;
sbp->sb\_gquotino = NULLFSINO;
and after the second call, we have set both pquotino and gquotino
to NULLFSINO.
Fix this by making it safe to call twice, and also remove the extra
calls to libxfs\_sb\_quota\_from\_disk.
This is only spotted when running xfstests with "-m crc=0" because
the sb\_from\_disk change came about after V5 became default, and
the above behavior only exists on a V4 superblock.

commit 26a137e31ffe6fbfdb008554a8d9b3d55bd5c86e upstream.
If the TPM we're connecting to uses a static burst count, it will report
a burst count of zero throughout the response read. However, get\_burstcount
assumes that a response of zero indicates that the TPM is not ready to
receive more data. In this case, it returns a negative error code, which
is passed on to tpm\_tis\_{write,read}\_bytes as a u16, causing
them to read/write far too many bytes.
This patch checks for negative return codes and bails out from recv\_data

PCI: Enable access to non-standard VPD for Chelsio devices (cxgb3)
commit 1c7de2b4ff886a45fbd2f4c3d4627e0f37a9dd77 upstream.
There is at least one Chelsio 10Gb card which uses VPD area to store some
non-standard blocks (example below). However pci\_vpd\_size() returns the
length of the first block only assuming that there can be only one VPD "End
Tag".
Since 4e1a635552d3 ("vfio/pci: Use kernel VPD access functions"), VFIO
blocks access beyond that offset, which prevents the guest "cxgb3" driver
from probing the device. The host system does not have this problem as its
driver accesses the config space directly without pci\_read\_vpd().
Add a quirk to override the VPD size to a bigger value. The maximum size
is taken from EEPROMSIZE in drivers/net/ethernet/chelsio/cxgb3/common.h.
We do not read the tag as the cxgb3 driver does as the driver supports
writing to EEPROM/VPD and when it writes, it only checks for 8192 bytes
boundary. The quirk is registered for all devices supported by the cxgb3
driver.
This adds a quirk to the PCI layer (not to the cxgb3 driver) as the cxgb3
driver itself accesses VPD directly and the problem only exists with the
vfio-pci driver (when cxgb3 is not running on the host and may not be even
loaded) which blocks accesses beyond the first block of VPD data. However
vfio-pci itself does not have quirks mechanism so we add it to PCI.
This is the controller:

PCI: Support INTx masking on ConnectX-4 with firmware x.14.1100+
commit 1600f62534b7b3da7978b43b52231a54c24df287 upstream.
Mellanox devices were marked as having INTx masking ability broken. As a
result, the VFIO driver fails to start when more than one device function
is passed-through to a VM if both have the same INTx pin.
Prior to Connect-IB, Mellanox devices exposed to the operating system one
PCI function per all ports. Starting from Connect-IB, the devices are
function-per-port. When passing the second function to a VM, VFIO will
fail to start.
Exclude ConnectX-4, ConnectX4-Lx and Connect-IB from the list of Mellanox
devices marked as having broken INTx masking:
- ConnectX-4 and ConnectX4-LX firmware version is checked. If INTx
masking is supported, we unmark the broken INTx masking.
- Connect-IB does not support INTx currently so will not cause any
problem.

PCI: rockchip: Correct the use of FTS mask
commit a45e2611b9bbd81288d97d02ce7e74a60a698d43 upstream.
We're trying to mask out bits[23:8] while retaining [32:24, 7:0], but we're
doing the inverse. That doesn't have too much effect, since we're setting
all the [23:8] bits to 1, and the other bits are only relevant for modes
we're currently not using. But we should get this right.

f2fs: hide a maybe-uninitialized warning
commit 230436b3ef3fd7d4a1da19edf5e87bb2d74e0fc2 upstream.
gcc is unsure about the use of last\_ofs\_in\_node, which might happen
without a prior initialization:
fs/f2fs//git/arm-soc/fs/f2fs/data.c: In function ‘f2fs\_map\_blocks’:
fs/f2fs/data.c:799:54: warning: ‘last\_ofs\_in\_node’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
if (prealloc && dn.ofs\_in\_node != last\_ofs\_in\_node + 1) {
As pointed out by Chao Yu, the code is actually correct as 'prealloc'
is only set if the last\_ofs\_in\_node has been set, the two always
get updated together.
This initializes last\_ofs\_in\_node to dn.ofs\_in\_node for each
new dnode at the start of the 'next\_block' loop, which at that
point is a correct initialization as well. I assume that compilers
that correctly track the contents of the variables and do not
warn about the condition also figure out that they can eliminate
the extra assignment here.

md: fix refcount problem on mddev when stopping array.
commit e2342ca832726a840ca6bd196dd2cc073815b08a upstream.
md\_open() gets a counted reference on an mddev using mddev\_find().
If it ends up returning an error, it must drop this reference.
There are two error paths where the reference is not dropped.
One only happens if the process is signalled and an awkward time,
which is quite unlikely.
The other was introduced recently in commit af8d8e6f0.
Change the code to ensure the drop the reference when returning an error,
and make it harded to re-introduce this sort of bug in the future.

we should refer to these round keys using 4x4 loads rather than 16x1 loads.
In addition, the ShiftRows tables are loading using a single scalar load,
which is also affected by endianness, so emit these tables in the correct
order depending on whether we are building for big endian or not.

mm, compaction: fix NR\_ISOLATED\_\* stats for pfn based migration
commit 6afcf8ef0ca0a69d014f8edb613d94821f0ae700 upstream.
Since commit bda807d44454 ("mm: migrate: support non-lru movable page
migration") isolate\_migratepages\_block) can isolate !PageLRU pages which
would acct\_isolated account as NR\_ISOLATED\_\*. Accounting these non-lru
pages NR\_ISOLATED\_{ANON,FILE} doesn't make any sense and it can misguide
heuristics based on those counters such as pgdat\_reclaimable\_pages resp.
too\_many\_isolated which would lead to unexpected stalls during the
direct reclaim without any good reason. Note that
\_\_alloc\_contig\_migrate\_range can isolate a lot of pages at once.
On mobile devices such as 512M ram android Phone, it may use a big zram
swap. In some cases zram(zsmalloc) uses too many non-lru but
migratedable pages, such as:
MemTotal: 468148 kB
Normal free:5620kB
Free swap:4736kB
Total swap:409596kB
ZRAM: 164616kB(zsmalloc non-lru pages)
active\_anon:60700kB
inactive\_anon:60744kB
active\_file:34420kB
inactive\_file:37532kB
Fix this by only accounting lru pages to NR\_ISOLATED\_\* in
isolate\_migratepages\_block right after they were isolated and we still
know they were on LRU. Drop acct\_isolated because it is called after
the fact and we've lost that information. Batching per-cpu counter
doesn't make much improvement anyway. Also make sure that we uncharge
only LRU pages when putting them back on the LRU in
putback\_movable\_pages resp. when unmap\_and\_move migrates the page.

mm: khugepaged: close use-after-free race during shmem collapsing
commit 91a45f71078a6569ec3ca5bef74e1ab58121d80e upstream.
Patch series "mm: workingset: radix tree subtleties & single-page file
refaults", v3.
This is another revision of the radix tree / workingset patches based on
feedback from Jan and Kirill.
This is a follow-up to d3798ae8c6f3 ("mm: filemap: don't plant shadow
entries without radix tree node"). That patch fixed an issue that was
caused mainly by the page cache sneaking special shadow page entries
into the radix tree and relying on subtleties in the radix tree code to
make that work. The fix also had to stop tracking refaults for
single-page files because shadow pages stored as direct pointers in
radix\_tree\_root->rnode weren't properly handled during tree extension.
These patches make the radix tree code explicitely support and track
such special entries, to eliminate the subtleties and to restore the
thrash detection for single-page files.
This patch (of 9):
When a radix tree iteration drops the tree lock, another thread might
swoop in and free the node holding the current slot. The iteration
needs to do another tree lookup from the current index to continue.

We cannot use the pte value used in set\_pte\_at for pte\_same comparison,
because archs like ppc64, filter/add new pte flag in set\_pte\_at.
Instead fetch the pte value inside hugetlb\_cow. We are comparing pte
value to make sure the pte didn't change since we dropped the page table
lock. hugetlb\_cow get called with page table lock held, and we can take
a copy of the pte value before we drop the page table lock.
With hugetlbfs, we optimize the MAP\_PRIVATE write fault path with no
previous mapping (huge\_pte\_none entries), by forcing a cow in the fault
path. This avoid take an addition fault to covert a read-only mapping
to read/write. Here we were comparing a recently instantiated pte (via
set\_pte\_at) to the pte values from linux page table. As explained above
on ppc64 such pte\_same check returned wrong result, resulting in us
taking an additional fault on ppc64.

genirq/affinity: Fix node generation from cpumask
commit c0af52437254fda8b0cdbaae5a9b6d9327f1fcd5 upstream.
Commit 34c3d9819fda ("genirq/affinity: Provide smarter irq spreading
infrastructure") introduced a better IRQ spreading mechanism, taking
account of the available NUMA nodes in the machine.
Problem is that the algorithm of retrieving the nodemask iterates
"linearly" based on the number of online nodes - some architectures
present non-linear node distribution among the nodemask, like PowerPC.
If this is the case, the algorithm lead to a wrong node count number
and therefore to a bad/incomplete IRQ affinity distribution.
For example, this problem were found in a machine with 128 CPUs and two
nodes, namely nodes 0 and 8 (instead of 0 and 1, if it was linearly
distributed). This led to a wrong affinity distribution which then led to
a bad mq allocation for nvme driver.
Finally, we take the opportunity to fix a comment regarding the affinity
distribution when we have \_more\_ nodes than vectors.

PM / wakeirq: Fix dedicated wakeirq for drivers not using autosuspend
commit bed570307ed78f21b77cb04a1df781dee4a8f05a upstream.
I noticed some wakeirq flakeyness with consumer drivers not using
autosuspend. For drivers not using autosuspend, the wakeirq may never
get unmasked in rpm\_suspend() because of irq desc->depth.
We are configuring dedicated wakeirqs to start with IRQ\_NOAUTOEN as we
naturally don't want them running until rpm\_suspend() is called.
However, when a consumer driver initially calls pm\_runtime\_get(), we
now wrongly start with disable\_irq\_nosync() call on the dedicated
wakeirq that is disabled to start with.
This causes desc->depth to toggle between 1 and 2 instead of the usual
0 and 1. This can prevent enable\_irq() from unmasking the wakeirq as
that only happens at desc->depth 1.
This does not necessarily show up with drivers using autosuspend as
there is time for disable\_irq\_nosync() before rpm\_suspend() gets called
after the autosuspend timeout.
Let's fix the issue by adding wirq->status that lazily gets set on
the first rpm\_suspend(). We also need PM runtime core private functions
for dev\_pm\_enable\_wake\_irq\_check() and dev\_pm\_disable\_wake\_irq\_check()
so we can enable the dedicated wakeirq on the first rpm\_suspend().
While at it, let's also fix the comments for dev\_pm\_enable\_wake\_irq()
and dev\_pm\_disable\_wake\_irq(). Those can still be used by the consumer
drivers as needed because the IRQ core manages the interrupt usecount
for us.

ima: fix memory leak in ima\_release\_policy
commit 9a11a18902bc3b904353063763d06480620245a6 upstream.
When the "policy" securityfs file is opened for read, it is opened as a
sequential file. However, when it is eventually released, there is no
cleanup for the sequential file, therefore some memory is leaked.
This patch adds a call to seq\_release() in ima\_release\_policy() to clean up
the memory when the file is opened for read.

iommu/vt-d: Flush old iommu caches for kdump when the device gets context mapped

We met the DMAR fault both on hpsa P420i and P421 SmartArray controllers
under kdump, it can be steadily reproduced on several different machines,
the dmesg log is like:

hpsa 0000:02:00.0: controller message 03:00 timed out
hpsa 0000:02:00.0: no-op failed; re-trying
After some debugging, we found that the fault addr is from DMA initiated at
the driver probe stage after reset(not in-flight DMA), and the corresponding
pte entry value is correct, the fault is likely due to the old iommu caches
of the in-flight DMA before it.
Thus we need to flush the old cache after context mapping is setup for the
device, where the device is supposed to finish reset at its driver probe
stage and no in-flight DMA exists hereafter.
I'm not sure if the hardware is responsible for invalidating all the related
caches allocated in the iommu hardware before, but seems not the case for hpsa,
actually many device drivers have problems in properly resetting the hardware.
Anyway flushing (again) by software in kdump kernel when the device gets context
mapped which is a quite infrequent operation does little harm.
With this patch, the problematic machine can survive the kdump tests.

iommu/vt-d: Fix pasid table size encoding
commit 65ca7f5f7d1cdde6c25172fe6107cd16902f826f upstream.
Different encodings are used to represent supported PASID bits
and number of PASID table entries.
The current code assigns ecap\_pss directly to extended context
table entry PTS which is wrong and could result in writing
non-zero bits to the reserved fields. IOMMU fault reason
11 will be reported when reserved bits are nonzero.
This patch converts ecap\_pss to extend context entry pts encoding
based on VT-d spec. Chapter 9.4 as follows:
- number of PASID bits = ecap\_pss + 1
- number of PASID table entries = 2^(pts + 5)
Software assigned limit of pasid\_max value is also respected to
match the allocation limitation of PASID table.

iommu/amd: Fix the left value check of cmd buffer
commit 432abf68a79332282329286d190e21fe3ac02a31 upstream.
The generic command buffer entry is 128 bits (16 bytes), so the offset
of tail and head pointer should be 16 bytes aligned and increased with
0x10 per command.
When cmd buf is full, head = (tail + 0x10) % CMD\_BUFFER\_SIZE.
So when left space of cmd buf should be able to store only two
command, we should be issued one COMPLETE\_WAIT additionally to wait
all older commands completed. Then the left space should be increased
after IOMMU fetching from cmd buf.
So left check value should be left <= 0x20 (two commands).

other platforms. Unfortunately I copy/pasted from other similar

hwmon: (nct7802) Fix overflows seen when writing into limit attributes
commit c0d04e9112ad59d73f23f3b0f6726c5e798dfcbf upstream.
Fix overflows seen when writing voltage and temperature limit attributes.
The value passed to DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST() needs to be clamped, and the
value parameter passed to nct7802\_write\_fan\_min() is an unsigned long.
Also, writing values larger than 2700000 into a fan limit attribute results
in writing 0 into the chip's limit registers. The exact behavior when
writing this value is unspecified. For consistency, report a limit of
1350000 if the chip register reads 0. This may be wrong, and the chip
behavior should be verified with the actual chip, but it is better than
reporting a value of 0 (which, when written, results in writing a value
of 0x1fff into the chip register).

commit 13edb767aa609b6efb7c0c2b57fbd72a6ded0eed upstream.
If the driver is built as a module, autoload won't work because the module
alias information is not filled. So user-space can't match the registered
device with the corresponding module.
Export the module alias information using the MODULE\_DEVICE\_TABLE() macro.

platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: use brightness\_set\_blocking for LED-setting callbacks
commit a608a9d52fa4168efd478d684039ed545a69dbcd upstream.
All LED-setting functions in fujitsu-laptop are currently assigned to
the brightness\_set callback, which is incorrect because they can sleep
(due to their use of call\_fext\_func(), which in turn issues ACPI calls)
and the documentation (in include/linux/leds.h) clearly states they must
not. Assign them to brightness\_set\_blocking instead and change them to
match the expected function prototype.
This change makes it possible to use Fujitsu-specific LEDs with "heavy"
triggers, like disk-activity or phy0rx.

debugfs: improve DEFINE\_DEBUGFS\_ATTRIBUTE for !CONFIG\_DEBUG\_FS
commit 7f847dd31736f1284538e54f46cf10e63929eb7f upstream.
The slp\_s0\_residency\_usec debugfs file currently uses
DEFINE\_DEBUGFS\_ATTRIBUTE(), but that macro cannot really be used to
define files outside of the debugfs code, as it has no reference to
the get/set functions if CONFIG\_DEBUG\_FS is not defined:
drivers/platform/x86/intel\_pmc\_core.c:80:12: error: ‘pmc\_core\_dev\_state\_get’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
This fixes the macro to always contain the reference, and instead rely
on the stubbed-out debugfs\_create\_file to not actually refer to
its arguments so the compiler can still drop the reference.
This works because the attribute definition is always 'static',
and the dead-code removal silently drops all static symbols
that are not used.

nl80211: Use different attrs for BSSID and random MAC addr in scan req
commit 2fa436b3a2a7009c11a3bc03fe0ff4c26e80fd87 upstream.
NL80211\_ATTR\_MAC was used to set both the specific BSSID to be scanned
and the random MAC address to be used when privacy is enabled. When both
the features are enabled, both the BSSID and the local MAC address were
getting same value causing Probe Request frames to go with unintended
DA. Hence, this has been fixed by using a different NL80211\_ATTR\_BSSID
attribute to set the specific BSSID (which was the more recent addition
in cfg80211) for a scan.
Backwards compatibility with old userspace software is maintained to
some extent by allowing NL80211\_ATTR\_MAC to be used to set the specific
BSSID when scanning without enabling random MAC address use.
Scanning with random source MAC address was introduced by commit
ad2b26abc157 ("cfg80211: allow drivers to support random MAC addresses
for scan") and the issue was introduced with the addition of the second
user for the same attribute in commit 818965d39177 ("cfg80211: Allow a
scan request for a specific BSSID").

mac80211: fix tid\_agg\_rx NULL dereference
commit 1c3d185a9a0b136a58e73b02912d593d0303d1da upstream.
On drivers setting the SUPPORTS\_REORDERING\_BUFFER hardware flag,
we crash when the peer sends an AddBA request while we already
have a session open on the seame TID; this is because on those
drivers, the tid\_agg\_rx is left NULL even though the session is
valid, and the agg\_session\_valid bit is set.
To fix this, store the dialog tokens outside the tid\_agg\_rx to
be able to compare them to the received AddBA request.

drm/i915/dp: add lane\_count check in intel\_dp\_check\_link\_status
commit d4cb3fd9b548b8bfe2a712ec920b9ebabd3547ab upstream.
Currently it's entirely possible to go through the link training step
without first determining the lane\_count, which is silly since we end up
doing a bunch of aux transfers of size = 0, as highlighted by
WARN\_ON(!msg->buffer != !msg->size), and can only ever result in a
'failed to update link training' message. This can be observed during
intel\_dp\_long\_pulse where we can do the link training step, but before
we have had a chance to set the link params. To avoid this we add an
extra check for the lane\_count in intel\_dp\_check\_link\_status, which
should prevent us from doing the link training step prematurely.

commit 0416e494ce7d ("usb: dwc3: ep0: correct cache
sync issue in case of ep0\_bounced") introduced a bug
where we would leak DMA resources which would cause
us to starve the system of them resulting in failing
DMA transfers.
Fix the bug by making sure that we always unmap EP0
requests since those are \*always\* mapped.

iio: accel: st\_accel: fix LIS3LV02 reading and scaling
commit 65e4345c8ef8811bbb4860fe5f2df10646b7f2e1 upstream.
The LIS3LV02 has a special bit that need to be set to get the
read values left aligned. Before this patch we get gibberish
like this:
iio\_generic\_buffer -a -c10 -n lis3lv02dl\_accel
(...)
0.000000 -0.010042 -0.642688 19155832931907
0.000000 -0.010042 -0.642688 19155858751073
Which is because we read a raw value for 1g as 64 which is
the nominal 1024 for 1g shifted 4 bits to the left by being
right-aligned rather than left aligned.
Since all other sensors are left aligned, add some code to
set the special DAS (data alignment setting) bit to 1 so that
the right value is now read like this:
iio\_generic\_buffer -a -c10 -n lis3lv02dl\_accel
(...)
0.000000 -0.147095 -10.120135 24761614364956
-0.029419 -0.176514 -10.120135 24761631624540
The scaling was weird as well: we have a gain of 1000 for 1g
and 3000 for 6g. I don't even remember how I came up with the
old values but they are wrong.

The 2 USB host ports are directly tied to the 2 USB hosts in the SoC.
The 2 host pairs were already enabled, but the USB PHY wasn't.
VBUS on the 2 ports are always on.
Enable the USB PHY.

commit 3c3dd1e058cb01e835dcade4b54a6f13ffaeaf7c upstream.
Function klsi\_105\_open() calls usb\_control\_msg() (to "enable read") and
checks its return value. When the return value is unexpected, it only
assigns the error code to the return variable retval, but does not
terminate the exception path. This patch fixes the bug by inserting
"goto err\_generic\_close;" when the call to usb\_control\_msg() fails.

usb: gadget: udc: core: fix return code of usb\_gadget\_probe\_driver()
commit 7b01738112608ce47083178ae2b9ebadf02d32cc upstream.
This fixes a regression which was introduced by commit f1bddbb, by
reverting a small fragment of commit 855ed04.
If the following conditions were met, usb\_gadget\_probe\_driver() returned
0, although the call was unsuccessful:
1. A particular UDC was specified by thge gadget driver (using member
"udc\_name" of struct usb\_gadget\_driver).
2. The UDC with this name is available.
3. Another gadget driver is already bound to this gadget.
4. The gadget driver has the "match\_existing\_only" flag set.
In this case, the return code variable "ret" is set to 0, the return
code of a strcmp() call (to check for the second condition).
This also fixes an oops which could occur in the following scenario:
1. Two usb gadget instances were configured using configfs.
2. The first gadget configuration was bound to a UDC (using the configfs
attribute "UDC").
3. It was tried to bind the second gadget configuration to the same UDC
in the same way. This operation was then wrongly reported as being
successful.
4. The second gadget configuration's "UDC" attribute is cleared, to
unbind the (not really bound) second gadget configuration from the UDC.

xhci: Fix race related to abort operation
commit 1c111b6c3844a142e03bcfc2fa17bfbdea08e9dc upstream.
Current abort operation has race.
xhci\_handle\_command\_timeout()
xhci\_abort\_cmd\_ring()
xhci\_write\_64(CMD\_RING\_ABORT)
xhci\_handshake(5s)
do {
check CMD\_RING\_RUNNING
udelay(1)
...
COMP\_CMD\_ABORT event
COMP\_CMD\_STOP event
xhci\_handle\_stopped\_cmd\_ring()
restart cmd\_ring
CMD\_RING\_RUNNING become 1 again
} while ()
return -ETIMEDOUT
xhci\_write\_64(CMD\_RING\_ABORT)
/\* can abort random command \*/
To do abort operation correctly, we have to wait both of COMP\_CMD\_STOP
event and negation of CMD\_RING\_RUNNING.
But like above, while timeout handler is waiting negation of
CMD\_RING\_RUNNING, event handler can restart cmd\_ring. So timeout
handler never be notice negation of CMD\_RING\_RUNNING, and retry of
CMD\_RING\_ABORT can abort random command (BTW, I guess retry of
CMD\_RING\_ABORT was workaround of this race).
To fix this race, this moves xhci\_handle\_stopped\_cmd\_ring() to
xhci\_abort\_cmd\_ring(). And timeout handler waits COMP\_CMD\_STOP event.
At this point, timeout handler is owner of cmd\_ring, and safely
restart cmd\_ring by using xhci\_handle\_stopped\_cmd\_ring().
[FWIW, as bonus, this way would be easily extend to add CMD\_RING\_PAUSE
operation]

A static usb-serial-driver structure that is used to initialise the

probed device type, something which could break a parallel probe of a
device of a different type.
Fix this up by overriding the default completion callback for MCS7715
devices in attach() instead. We may want to use two usb-serial driver
instances for the two types later.

usb: return error code when platform\_get\_irq fails
commit 28bedb5ae463b9f7e5195cbc93f1795e374bdef8 upstream.
In function xhci\_mtk\_probe(), variable ret takes the return value. Its
value should be negative on failures. However, when the call to function
platform\_get\_irq() fails, it does not set the error code, and 0 will be
returned. 0 indicates no error. As a result, the callers of function
xhci\_mtk\_probe() will not be able to detect the error. This patch fixes
the bug by assigning the return value of platform\_get\_irq() to variable
ret if it fails.

usb: xhci: hold lock over xhci\_abort\_cmd\_ring()
commit 4dea70778c0f48b4385c7720c363ec8d37a401b4 upstream.
In command timer function, xhci\_handle\_command\_timeout(), xhci->lock
is unlocked before call into xhci\_abort\_cmd\_ring(). This might cause
race between the timer function and the event handler.
The xhci\_abort\_cmd\_ring() function sets the CMD\_RING\_ABORT bit in the
command register and polling it until the setting takes effect. A stop
command ring event might be handled between writing the abort bit and
polling for it. The event handler will restart the command ring, which
causes the failure of polling, and we ever believed that we failed to
stop it.
As a bonus, this also fixes some issues of calling functions without
locking in xhci\_handle\_command\_timeout().

xhci: Handle command completion and timeout race
commit a5a1b9514154437aa1ed35c291191f82fd3e941a upstream.
If we get a command completion event at the same time as the command
timeout work starts on another cpu we might end up aborting the wrong
command.
If the command completion takes the xhci lock before the timeout work, it
will handle the command, pick the next command, mark it as current\_cmd, and
re-queue the timeout work. When the timeout work finally gets the lock
It will start aborting the wrong command.
This case can be resolved by checking if the timeout work is pending inside
the timeout function itself. A new timeout work can only be pending if the
command completed and a new command was queued.
If there are no more commands pending then command completion will set
the current\_cmd to NULL, which is already handled in the timeout work.

usb: xhci: fix return value of xhci\_setup\_device()

xhci\_setup\_device() should return failure with correct error number
when xhci host has died, removed or halted.
During usb device enumeration, if usb host is not accessible (died,
removed or halted), the hc\_driver->address\_device() should return
a corresponding error code to usb core. But current xhci driver just
returns success. This misleads usb core to continue the enumeration
by reading the device descriptor, which will result in failure, and
users will get a misleading message like "device descriptor read/8,
error -110".

usb: xhci: fix possible wild pointer
commit 2b985467371a58ae44d76c7ba12b0951fee6ed98 upstream.
handle\_cmd\_completion() frees a command structure which might be still
referenced by xhci->current\_cmd.
This might cause problem when xhci->current\_cmd is accessed after that.
A real-life case could be like this. The host takes a very long time to
respond to a command, and the command timer is fired at the same time
when the command completion event arrives. The command completion
handler frees xhci->current\_cmd before the timer function can grab
xhci->lock. Afterward, timer function grabs the lock and go ahead with
checking and setting members of xhci->current\_cmd.

usb: gadget: composite: Test get\_alt() presence instead of set\_alt()
commit 7e4da3fcf7c9fe042f2f7cb7bf23861a899b4a8f upstream.
By convention (according to doc) if function does not provide
get\_alt() callback composite framework should assume that it has only
altsetting 0 and should respond with error if host tries to set
other one.
After commit dd4dff8b035f ("USB: composite: Fix bug: should test
set\_alt function pointer before use it")
we started checking set\_alt() callback instead of get\_alt().
This check is useless as we check if set\_alt() is set inside
usb\_add\_function() and fail if it's NULL.
Let's fix this check and move comment about why we check the get
method instead of set a little bit closer to prevent future false
fixes.

USB: dummy-hcd: fix bug in stop\_activity (handle ep0)
commit bcdbeb844773333d2d1c08004f3b3e25921040e5 upstream.
The stop\_activity() routine in dummy-hcd is supposed to unlink all
active requests for every endpoint, among other things. But it
doesn't handle ep0. As a result, fuzz testing can generate a WARNING
like the following:

This patch fixes the problem by iterating over all the endpoints in

which explicitly leaves out ep0.

USB: fix problems with duplicate endpoint addresses
commit 0a8fd1346254974c3a852338508e4a4cddbb35f1 upstream.
When checking a new device's descriptors, the USB core does not check
for duplicate endpoint addresses. This can cause a problem when the
sysfs files for those endpoints are created; trying to create multiple
files with the same name will provoke a WARNING:

USB: gadgetfs: fix checks of wTotalLength in config descriptors
commit 1c069b057dcf64fada952eaa868d35f02bb0cfc2 upstream.
Andrey Konovalov's fuzz testing of gadgetfs showed that we should
improve the driver's checks for valid configuration descriptors passed
in by the user. In particular, the driver needs to verify that the
wTotalLength value in the descriptor is not too short (smaller
than USB\_DT\_CONFIG\_SIZE). And the check for whether wTotalLength is
too large has to be changed, because the driver assumes there is
always enough room remaining in the buffer to hold a device descriptor
(at least USB\_DT\_DEVICE\_SIZE bytes).
This patch adds the additional check and fixes the existing check. It
may do a little more than strictly necessary, but one extra check
won't hurt.

The cause of the bug is subtle. The dev\_config() routine gets called
twice by the fuzzer. The first time, the user data contains both a
full-speed configuration descriptor and a high-speed config
descriptor, causing dev->hs\_config to be set. But it also contains an
invalid device descriptor, so the buffer containing the descriptors is
deallocated and dev\_config() returns an error.
The second time dev\_config() is called, the user data contains only a
full-speed config descriptor. But dev->hs\_config still has the stale
pointer remaining from the first call, causing the routine to think
that there is a valid high-speed config. Later on, when the driver
dereferences the stale pointer to copy that descriptor, we get a
use-after-free access.
The fix is simple: Clear dev->hs\_config if the passed-in data does not
contain a high-speed config descriptor.

Indeed, there is a comment saying that the value of len is restricted
to a 16-bit integer, but the code doesn't actually do this.
This patch fixes the warning. It replaces the comment with a
computation that forces the amount of data copied from the user in
ep0\_write() to be no larger than the wLength size for the control
transfer, which is a 16-bit quantity.

KVM: MIPS: Don't clobber CP0\_Status.UX
commit 4c881451d3017033597ea186cf79ae41a73e1ef8 upstream.
On 64-bit kernels, MIPS KVM will clear CP0\_Status.UX to prevent the
guest (running in user mode) from accessing the 64-bit memory segments.
However the previous value of CP0\_Status.UX is never restored when
exiting from the guest.
If the user process uses 64-bit addressing (the n64 ABI) this can result
in address error exceptions from the kernel if it needs to deliver a
signal before returning to user mode, as the kernel will need to write a
sigframe to high user addresses on the user stack which are disallowed
by CP0\_Status.UX=0.
This is fixed by explicitly setting SX and UX again when exiting from
the guest, and explicitly clearing those bits when returning to the
guest. Having the SX and UX bits set when handling guest exits (rather
than only when exiting to userland) will be helpful when we support VZ,
since we shouldn't need to directly read or write guest memory, so it
will be valid for cache management IPIs to access host user addresses.

drm/i915: Force VDD off on the new power seqeuencer before starting to use it
commit 8581f1b5ee0837e55197f036406bc99746ac94b2 upstream.
Apparently some VLV BIOSen like to leave the VDD force bit enabled
even for power seqeuncers that aren't properly hooked up to any
port. That will result in a imbalance in the AUX power domain
refcount when we stat to use said power sequencer as edp\_panel\_vdd\_on()
will not grab the power domain reference if it sees that the VDD is
already on.
To fix this let's make sure we turn off the VDD force bit when we
initialize the power sequencer registers. That is, unless it's
being done from the init path since there we are actually
initializing the registers for the current power sequencer and
we don't want to turn VDD off needlessly as that would require
waiting for the power cycle delay before we turn it back on.
This fixes the following kind of warnings:

asm-prototypes: Clear any CPP defines before declaring the functions
commit c7858bf16c0b2cc62f475f31e6df28c3a68da1d6 upstream.
The asm-prototypes.h file is used to provide dummy function declarations
for genksyms, when processing asm files with EXPORT\_SYMBOL. Make sure
that any architecture defines get out of our way. x86 currently has an
issue with memcpy on 64bit with CONFIG\_KMEMCHECK=y and with
memset/\_\_memset on 32bit:

mac80211: initialize fast-xmit 'info' later
commit 35f432a03e41d3bf08c51ede917f94e2288fbe8c upstream.
In ieee80211\_xmit\_fast(), 'info' is initialized to point to the skb
that's passed in, but that skb may later be replaced by a clone (if
it was shared), leading to an invalid pointer.
This can lead to use-after-free and also later crashes since the
real SKB's info->hw\_queue doesn't get initialized properly.
Fix this by assigning info only later, when it's needed, after the
skb replacement (may have) happened.

parisc: Mark cr16 clocksource unstable on SMP systems
commit 41744213602a206f24adcb4a2b7551db3c700e72 upstream.
The cr16 interval timer of each CPU is not syncronized to other cr16
timers in other CPUs in a SMP system. So, delay the registration of the
cr16 clocksource until all CPUs have been detected and then - if we are
on a SMP machine - mark the cr16 clocksource as unstable and lower it's
rating before registering it at the clocksource framework.
This patch fixes the stalled CPU warnings which we have seen since

fscrypt: fix renaming and linking special files
commit 42d97eb0ade31e1bc537d086842f5d6e766d9d51 upstream.
Attempting to link a device node, named pipe, or socket file into an
encrypted directory through rename(2) or link(2) always failed with
EPERM. This happened because fscrypt\_has\_permitted\_context() saw that
the file was unencrypted and forbid creating the link. This behavior
was unexpected because such files are never encrypted; only regular
files, directories, and symlinks can be encrypted.
To fix this, make fscrypt\_has\_permitted\_context() always return true on
special files.
This will be covered by a test in my encryption xfstests patchset.

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix irq/process data synchronization
commit 1d0f953086f090a022f2c0e1448300c15372db46 upstream.
Commit 16200948d83 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Fix race at stopping the stream") was
incomplete causing another more severe kernel panic, so it got reverted.
This fixes both the original problem and its fallout kernel race/crash.
The original fix is to move the endpoint member NULL clearing logic inside
wait\_clear\_urbs() so the irq triggering the urb completion doesn't call
retire\_capture/playback\_urb() after the NULL clearing and generate a panic.
However this creates a new race between snd\_usb\_endpoint\_start()'s call
to wait\_clear\_urbs() and the irq urb completion handler which again calls
retire\_capture/playback\_urb() leading to a new NULL dereference.
We keep the EP deactivation code in snd\_usb\_endpoint\_start() because
removing it will break the EP reference counting (see [1] [2] for info),
however we don't need the "can\_sleep" mechanism anymore because a new
function was introduced (snd\_usb\_endpoint\_sync\_pending\_stop()) which
synchronizes pending stops and gets called inside the pcm prepare callback.
It also makes sense to remove can\_sleep because it was also removed from
deactivate\_urbs() signature in [3] so we benefit from more simplification.

xfs: don't BUG() on mixed direct and mapped I/OWe've had reports of generic/095 causing XFS to BUG() in
\_\_xfs\_get\_blocks() due to the existence of delalloc blocks on a
direct I/O read. generic/095 issues a mix of various types of I/O,
including direct and memory mapped I/O to a single file. This is
clearly not supported behavior and is known to lead to such
problems. E.g., the lack of exclusion between the direct I/O and
write fault paths means that a write fault can allocate delalloc
blocks in a region of a file that was previously a hole after the
direct read has attempted to flush/inval the file range, but before
it actually reads the block mapping. In turn, the direct read
discovers a delalloc extent and cannot proceed.
While the appropriate solution here is to not mix direct and memory
mapped I/O to the same regions of the same file, the current
BUG\_ON() behavior is probably overkill as it can crash the entire
system. Instead, localize the failure to the I/O in question by
returning an error for a direct I/O that cannot be handled safely
due to delalloc blocks. Be careful to allow the case of a direct
write to post-eof delalloc blocks. This can occur due to speculative
preallocation and is safe as post-eof blocks are not accompanied by
dirty pages in pagecache (conversely, preallocation within eof must
have been zeroed, and thus dirtied, before the inode size could have
been increased beyond said blocks).
Finally, provide an additional warning if a direct I/O write occurs
while the file is memory mapped. This may not catch all problematic
scenarios, but provides a hint that some known-to-be-problematic I/O
methods are in use.

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
