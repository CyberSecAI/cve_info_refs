# MemberSonic Lite <= 1.2 allows login without proper authorization

by [James Golovich](https://www.pritect.net/blog/author/james)

June 28, 2016

While looking for a membership plugin for WordPress I stumbled on [MemberSonic](http://www.membersonic.com/) and the free version of their plugin [MemberSonic Lite](http://www.membersonic.com/lp/launch-kit/). After a 10 minute wait while watching their promotional video they finally email you a link to the Lite version. I could not find any indication on the site regarding how many sites/users their plugins have. It appears that they released something back in September of 2012, so there must be more than a handful of users out there.

Anyone using [MemberSonic Lite](http://www.membersonic.com/lp/launch-kit/) should upgrade immediately, version 1.2 has a flaw allowing an unauthorized user to login to any account simply by knowing the email address associated with the account, this includes any accounts with administrator privileges.

I do not know if this affects the commercial version of the product and I have not done any further auditing of the Lite product. As of 6/28/2016, there has not been a new posting on their [blog](http://www.membersonic.com/news/) related to this issue or announcing an update to the Pro version.
