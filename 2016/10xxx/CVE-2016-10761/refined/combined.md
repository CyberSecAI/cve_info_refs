## Multiple wireless keyboard/mouse devices use an unsafe proprietary wireless protocol

#### Vulnerability Note VU#981271

Original Release Date: 2016-02-24 | Last Revised: 2016-03-01

---

### Overview

Wireless keyboard and mouse devices from multiple vendors use proprietary wireless protocols that are not properly secured.

### Description

| [**CWE-311**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html)**: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**  Multiple wireless input devices (keyboard and mouse) use a proprietary wireless protocol on the 2.4 GHz ISM band that lacks proper encryption. An attacker within wireless transmission range can inject keystrokes or read keystroke data, or cause the victim's device to pair with a new input device. Wireless range on these models varies but is typically a few meters within a home.The researchers have released a [website](https://www.mousejack.com/) as well as [advisories](https://github.com/RFStorm/mousejack/tree/master/doc/advisories) with more details.This vulnerability does not impact Bluetooth devices. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker within wireless transmission range can inject keystrokes on the victim's device, or cause the victim's device to pair with a new input device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update device firmware**According to the [researcher](https://www.bastille.net/affected-devices), Logitech has released an updated firmware for their devices to address this issue. Please contact Logitech customer support for more information.Users of other models should consider individual use cases and threat models when using the devices until an update is available. |

Overview
A vulnerability has been discovered in the way Logitech Unifying dongles process received RF packets, allowing keystroke injection that bypasses encryption.
Impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject keystrokes into a computer equipped with a Logitech Unifying wireless keyboard.
Affected Platforms
The following products have been tested and shown to be affected:
- Logitech K400r- Logitech K360- Logitech K750 - Logitech K830- Logitech Unifying dongle (USB ID 046d:c52b) - firmware version 012.001.00019 - firmware version 012.003.00025
Mitigation
Exploiting this vulnerability involves transmitting RF packets to a Logitech Unifying dongle, which requires physical proximity to the target computer.
