{
  "cveId": "CVE-2016-10727",
  "description": "The vulnerability exists in Evolution Data Server. When a user configures STARTTLS encryption but the server doesn't support it, the application would downgrade to an unencrypted connection instead of showing an error. This would expose the user's password in clear text.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The application logic incorrectly handled the case where a server did not support STARTTLS, failing to report the error and instead falling back to an insecure connection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure fallback to plaintext connection",
      "Improper error handling",
      "Lack of secure connection enforcement"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of user credentials (passwords) in clear text over the network.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks",
      "Network sniffing",
      "Compromised network environment"
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the server can capture user credentials.",
    "requiredPosition": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the vulnerable client and the server."

    {
      "package": "evolution-data-server",

  ],
   "additionalDetails": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered when the user configures the email client to use STARTTLS, but the server does not advertise support for STARTTLS in its capabilities response.",
         "The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring that the application terminates the connection attempt with an error if the server doesn't support STARTTLS when the user has configured it. "
