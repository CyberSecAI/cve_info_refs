{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Newspaper WordPress theme has an AJAX endpoint that allows unauthenticated users to update arbitrary WordPress options via the `td_ajax_update_panel` action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated arbitrary WordPress options update vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify WordPress options, leading to privilege escalation (e.g., setting the default role to administrator), enabling user registrations, etc. This can allow an attacker to create an administrative account and gain full control of the affected website.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `td_ajax_update_panel` and the `wp_option` parameter containing the option to be modified. The attacker can control the value being set for the option.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress website. No authentication is required."
