## Description

[![@feross](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121766?u=c9234b2a786d4d3722ab876563eb63069cd54959&v=4&size=48)](/feross)[feross](https://github.com/feross)opened [on Jan 2, 2016](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-dht/issues/87#issue-124613481)

We just fixed a security issue in the `bittorrent-dht` module that would allow an attacker to send a specific series of messages to a listening peer to make it disclose internal memory of the node.js process.

All users of `bittorrent-dht` should upgrade to version 5.1.3 or later.
