{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The NETGEAR WNR2000 router's web interface allows sensitive functions via the `apply.cgi` script. An unauthenticated version, `apply_noauth.cgi`, is also accessible, but requires a timestamp parameter to perform certain actions, acting as a sort of anti-CSRF token. The timestamp generation algorithm uses a predictable random number generator, making it possible to guess the timestamp value and bypass the protection. A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the `hidden_lang_avi` parameter, allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (Improper Access Control) due to unauthenticated access to sensitive functions through `apply_noauth.cgi`.",
      "Predictable Random Number Generator which makes it feasible to guess the timestamp value",
      "Stack buffer overflow in the handling of the `hidden_lang_avi` parameter when processing the `lang_check.html` page.",
        "Information Leakage by disclosing the serial number of the device in the response to a request to http://<device_web_portal>/BRS_netgear_success.html"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain remote code execution, including the ability to start telnetd and execute shell commands as root. Additionally, attackers can access administrator credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "remote_access": "The vulnerabilities are exploitable over the LAN by default, or over the WAN if remote administration is enabled.",
      "attack_steps":[
        "Recover device serial number via information leakage vulnerability",
        "Reset admin password recovery settings by using the timestamp bypass",
        "Recover admin username and password using the serial number and password recovery settings",
        "Enable telnet using the recovered administrator credentials to get a root shell",
        "Exploit stack buffer overflow using the timestamp bypass to achieve remote code execution, ultimately gaining a root shell by enabling telnetd"
      ]
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. They do not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerabilities. When exploiting remotely (over the WAN), the remote management feature needs to be enabled on the router. In the LAN an attacker needs to be in the same network."
