Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2016-10209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how `libarchive` handles certain malformed archive files, specifically during the processing of multi-byte character sequences in archive entries. The issue is related to the `archive_wstring_append_from_mbs()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The specific weakness is a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) occurring within the `archive_wstring_append_from_mbs()` function when processing a malformed archive. This indicates a memory access violation, likely due to incorrect handling of string lengths or character encodings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS). The segmentation fault causes the application using `libarchive` to crash, preventing it from processing archive files correctly. This can be triggered by an attacker providing a specially crafted archive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a malformed archive file to an application using `libarchive`. This could be through various means, such as opening a malicious archive, downloading it from a website, receiving it as an email attachment, etc.
- In the provided Github issue #842, an example payload (`la_segv_archive_wstring_append_from_mbs`) and command `bsdtar -t -f la_segv_archive_wstring_append_from_mbs` demonstrates a way to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted archive file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libarchive` library. No special privileges or network access to the target system is needed beyond this. An attacker can target a system that processes untrusted archives such as mail servers or file hosting services.
