The maintenance update will thus be marked as requiring reboot.  An rpm %post stanza may adjust the permissions of any files that may be there (rather than removing genunine timers) The desired permissions are 0644, specifically the lack of suid root while being world writable. Note that the final element of /var/lib/systemd/timers may not even exist, the scriptlet should not error out in this case.  However, there is a time window after the rpm scriptlet before a reboot where the offending files may be created again. It can be argued that we should not leave the impression that the rpm scriptlet is guaranteed to cover this.  Test case 1:  * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/ * package update itself must remove it  Test case 2:  * update package, do not reboot * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/ * reboot * file must be removed  Test case 3: * After update and reboot, activating a (new) timer does not create a world-readable suid root files ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c5)  Andreas Stieger   2017-01-18 13:06:45 UTC  ``` s/removed/permissions adjusted/  Test case 1:  * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/ * package update itself must adjust permissions  Test case 2:  * update package, do not reboot * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/ * reboot * file must have permissions adjusted  Test case 3: * After update and reboot * activating a (new) timer does not create a world-readable suid root files ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2017-01-18 13:08:41 UTC  ``` systemctl daemon-reexec may apply the new binary directly ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c7)  Sebastian Krahmer   2017-01-18 15:29:55 UTC  ``` Note that there may be other files (the "known unknowns") like /run/systemd/journal/flushed that are created with wrong mode, so making sure that no such files exist anymore, could be a bit tricky. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c8)  Franck Bui   2017-01-19 07:51:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sebastian Krahmer from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c0)) > systemd creates world writable suid files that allows > attackers to dump binaries into it and execute code as root easily: >   Just out of curiosity, the setuid bit seems to be automatically cleared by some tools like cp, dd, bash... how one can dump a binary into a world writable suid file without clearing the suid bit ? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c9)  Franck Bui   2017-01-19 07:57:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c3)) > > The problem seems to be in v228 only.  Indeed.  As a consequence:   - a system upgrading from SP[01] to SP2 won't be affected unless the permanent timers have been created after upgrading to SP2.   - a brand new SP2 installation will be affected. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c10)  Franck Bui   2017-01-19 07:58:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sebastian Krahmer from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c7)) > Note that there may be other files (the "known unknowns") > like /run/systemd/journal/flushed that are created with wrong mode, > so making sure that no such files exist anymore, could be a bit tricky.  Hm /run (as well as /var/run) is usually mounted with the "nosuid" option.  Isn't it the case for SLE12 ? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c11)  Franck Bui   2017-01-19 08:03:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andreas Stieger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c5)) > s/removed/permissions adjusted/ >  > Test case 1: >  > * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/ > * package update itself must adjust permissions >  > Test case 2:  > * update package, do not reboot > * Touch a world readable suid root file in /var/lib/systemd/timers/  I think instead of creating a dummy timer file manually, we should instead use a dummy timer unit and an associated dummy service and start the timer so systemd is creating itself the timer files. Because the fixes in systemd are not supposed to adjust permissions not created by systemd.  > * reboot > * file must have permissions adjusted >  > Test case 3: > * After update and reboot > * activating a (new) timer does not create a world-readable suid root files  You might want to add another test case:  Test case 4:  * install SP2  * file must have permissions adjusted  in order to make sure that fixed systemd is always used on new installations. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c12)  Franck Bui   2017-01-19 10:33:29 UTC  ``` The following project should contain the fix for this issue and will be submitted for the next maintenance release of SP2.

Thats probably why the systemd maintainers flagged it as DoS. A description plus PoC on how one can dump arbitrary code into world writable suid/sgid files without clearing the bit can be found here:  <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation/>  Its for setgid dirs, but it also works for suid files.  Can you paste a "grep /var /proc/mounts" to check whether its indeed nosuid for SLE12? On Leap, it wasnt mounted nosuid. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c14)  Franck Bui   2017-01-23 07:34:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sebastian Krahmer from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c13)) >  > Thats probably why the systemd maintainers flagged it as DoS. > A description plus PoC on how one can dump arbitrary code > into world writable suid/sgid files without clearing the > bit can be found here: >  > <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation/> >  > Its for setgid dirs, but it also works for suid files.

Either way, it would be good to have a solution to clean up any of the left files. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c16)  Andreas Stieger   2017-01-23 11:37:06 UTC  ``` CVE-2016-10156 was assigned by Mitre ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c17)  Franck Bui   2017-01-23 13:21:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sebastian Krahmer from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c15)) > Either way, it would be good to have a solution to clean up any of > the left files.  /run uses the "nosuid" option and it's mounted by systemd during system boot, so any files in this directory shouldn't be a problem.  I grepped over systemd source code with:   $ git grep "touch_file(.*MODE_INVALID)\|touch(" SLE12-SP2  and the only places I could have found are:   - /run/systemd/*     /run has the "nosuid" option so those should be fine and permissions    will be adjusted on the next reboot.      - /var/lib/systemd/linger/*     Created by logind which run with umask(0022), so this file is    not world writable either.     However the setuid will be removed on the next package update in order to    not left this file with the setuid bit indefinitely.     Permissions of existing timestamp files are adjusted on next package update.   - /var/lib/systemd/timers/*.timer     Permissions of existing timestamp files are adjusted on next package update.  @Sebastian, could you answer question from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c12) ? ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c18)  Sebastian Krahmer   2017-01-23 13:50:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to Franck Bui from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1020601#c12)) > The following project should contain the fix for this issue and will be > submitted for the next maintenance release of SP2. >  > Should I submit now or do anybody want to give it a test ? >   I assume that its the upstream patch, so it should be safe to be submitted now.

mode_t is unsigned, so MODE_INVALID < 0 can never be true.

This fixes a possible DoS where any user could fill /run by writing to
a world-writable /run/systemd/show-status.

/*
source: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/24/4

This is a heads up for a trivial systemd local root exploit, that
was silently fixed in the upstream git as:

commit 06eeacb6fe029804f296b065b3ce91e796e1cd0e
Author: ....
Date:   Fri Jan 29 23:36:08 2016 +0200

    basic: fix touch() creating files with 07777 mode

    mode_t is unsigned, so MODE_INVALID < 0 can never be true.

    This fixes a possible DoS where any user could fill /run by writing to
    a world-writable /run/systemd/show-status.

The analysis says that is a "possible DoS", but its a local root
exploit indeed. Mode 07777 also contains the suid bit, so files
created by touch() are world writable suids, root owned. Such
as /var/lib/systemd/timers/stamp-fstrim.timer thats found on a non-nosuid mount.

This is trivially exploited by something like:

http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/SetgidDirectoryPrivilegeEscalation/CreateSetgidBinary.c

with minimal changes, so I wont provide a PoC here.

The bug was possibly introduced via:

commit ee735086f8670be1591fa9593e80dd60163a7a2f
Author: ...
Date:   Wed Nov 11 22:54:56 2015 +0100

    util-lib: use MODE_INVALID as invalid value for mode_t everywhere

So we believe that this mostly affects v228 of systemd, but its recommended
that distributors cross-check their systemd versions for vulnerable
touch_*() functions. We requested
a CVE for this issue from MITRE by ourselfs: CVE-2016-10156

We would like to see that systemd upstream retrieves CVE's themself
for their own bugs, even if its believed that its just a local DoS.
This would make distributors life much easier when we read the git logs
to spot potential issues. The systemd git log is really huge, with
lots of commits each week ("new services as a service").

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
