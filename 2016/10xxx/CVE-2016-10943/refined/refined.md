Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2016-10943

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization/escaping of the `table_name`, `rlfrom`, and `rlto` parameters within the `zx_csv_home.php` file before being used in an SQL query. Specifically, the values are taken directly from POST parameters without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a SQL Injection. The code directly uses unsanitized user-supplied data to construct an SQL query using the `$wpdb->get_results()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters (`table_select`, `rsltfrom`, `rsltto`). This could lead to:
*   Data breaches: Reading sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, confidential information, or other stored data.
*   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
*   Privilege escalation: Possibly gaining access to higher level accounts or executing arbitrary code on the server if the database user has sufficient permissions.
*   Denial of Service (DoS): By crafting specific queries that would cause the database server to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=zx_csv_plugin_home`, with malicious SQL payloads injected into `table_select`, `rsltfrom` and `rsltto` POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account with admin privileges on the target WordPress site to access the vulnerable page.
*  The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable URL.
*  The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to construct a valid SQL injection payload.

**Additional details:**
The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates a basic SQL injection, selecting data from `wp_terms` table, which could potentially be extended with more complex payloads to extract sensitive data or alter the database.
