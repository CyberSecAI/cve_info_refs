Changes in version 2.1.3-alpha (1 May 2013)
 Libevent 2.1.3-alpha fixes various bugs, adds new unit tests, and cleans up the code in a couple of places. It has a new callback in evhttp for reporting errors during a request, a new feature for allowing evdns to not keep the event\_base looping when there are no requests inflight, and example code for writing an https client.
 Libevent 2.1.3-alpha also has an important new (experimental) event finalization feature to allow safe event teardown in multithreaded programs. This ought to fix the longstanding bug with deadlocks in multithreaded use of SSL-based bufferevents that some people have been experiencing since Libevent 2.0.
 Core (event finalization) o Implement event\_finalize() and related functions to avoid certain deadlocks (8eedeab) o Use finalization feature so bufferevents can avoid deadlocks (02fbf68) o Always run pending finalizers when event\_base\_free() is called (e9ebef8) o Remove bufferevent\_del\_generic\_timeout\_cbs as now unused (4ea4c6a) o More documentation for finalization feature (a800b91) o Make the event\_finalize\* functions return an error code (5d11f4f) o Mark the finalize stuff as experiemental in case it needs to change (23e2e29)

Changes in version 2.1.2-alpha (18 Nov 2012)
 Libevent 2.1.2-alpha includes more portable for monotonic timers, refactors much of Libevent's internal and external infrastructure, closes some longstanding gaps in the interface, makde other improvements. Ths log below tries to organize features by rough area of effect. It omits a few commits which were pure bugfixes on other commits listed below. For more detail, see the git changelogs. For more insight, see the "whatsnew-2.1.txt" document included in the Libevent 2.1.2-alpha distribution.
 Libevent 2.1.2-alpha also includes all changes made in 2.0.19-stable through 2.0.21-stable inclusive.
 Performance (core): o Replace pipe-based notification with EVFILT\_USER where possible. This should make multithreaded programs on OSX and \*BSD alert the main thread a little faster. (53a07fe) o Make th\_base\_lock nonrecursive. (9cd5acb)
 New/Changed API Functions: o New event\_get\_priority() function to return an event's priority (f90e255) o Add a bufferevent\_get\_priority() function (bd39554) o Add an event\_base\_loopcontinue() to tell Libevent to rescan for more events right away (7d6aa5e) o Add a new callback to get called on evbuffer\_file\_segment free (e9f8feb yangacer, 64051b9) o Expose event\_base\_foreach\_event() as a public API. (84fd6d7 Roman Puls, 232055e, ffe1643) o Add an event\_remove\_timer() to remove timer on an event without deleting it (e3b2e08) o Make bufferevent\_set\_timeouts(bev, NULL, NULL) have plausible semantics (9dee36b) o Rename event\_enable\_lock\_debuging() to ...\_debugging(). (The old name should still work.) (07e132e) o Add missing implementation for event\_enable\_debug\_logging (3b3e21d)
 PORTABLE MONOTONIC TIMERS:
 Libevent 2.1.2 includes internal support for monotonic timers on (nearly) all supported platforms, including Windows, and OSX. Libevent applications should now be more resilient to jumps forwards or backwards in the system clock. Also, on Linux systems with epoll, we now optionally support microsecond-level timeouts (whereas epoll only supports millisecond-precision timeouts).
 o Use mach\_absolute\_time() for monotonic clock support on OSX. (b8fd6f9) o Do not track use\_monotonic field when is no monotonic clock (cb653a0) o EVENT\_BASE\_FLAG\_PRECISE\_TIMER indicates we want fine timer precision (ddd69d3) o On Linux, use CLOCK\_MONOTONIC\_COARSE by default (55780a7) o Implement a GetTickCount-based monotonic timer for Windows (d5e1d5a) o Refactor monotonic timer handling into a new type and set of functions; add a gettimeofday-based ratcheting implementation (f5e4eb0) o Add EVENT\_PRECISE\_TIMER environment var for selecting precise-but-slow timer (a2598ec) o Implement fast/precise monotonic clocks on Windows (2c47045) o Simple unit tests for monotonic timers (630f077) o Improve the monotonic-time unit test: make it check the step size (7428c78) o When PRECISE\_TIMERS is set with epoll, use timerfd for microsecond precision (26c7582) o Split out time-related evutil functions into a new evutil\_time.c (c419485) o Split out time-related prototypes into time-internal.h (71bca50) o Add evutil\_time.obj to Makefile.nmake (0ba0683) o Avoid giving a spurious warning when timerfd support is unavailable (1aaf9f0 Dave Hart) o Make test\_evutil\_monotonic a little more tolerant (def3b83) o Avoid unused-var warning on systems with clock\_gettime but without CLOCK\_MONOTONIC\_COARSE (9be5468)
EVENT\_BASE\_ONCE LEAKS: If a callback added by event\_base\_once() is never invoked, Libevent no longer leaks internal memory.
 o Free dangling event\_once objects on event\_base\_free() (c17dd59) o Add a unit test in which an event is created with event\_base\_once() but never fires (4343edf)
TESTING SUPPORT, FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
 Libevent now disables by default its unit tests that would touch the network, or that tend to fail on heavily-loaded systems. To re-enable them, invoke the ./test/regress program with the @all alias.
 o Simplify test.sh code significantly. (9b856fd Ross Lagerwall) o Make all tests that hit the network disabled by default (f2cea87) o Avoid a resource leak on error in http client benchmark (ea92fba) o Update to latest tinytest (911b4f0349377) (ef7c4f7) o Avoid (unlikely) overflow in bench\_httpclient.c (5671033) o Shave 700 msec off the persistent\_timeout\_jump test (21205b8) o Check return value of write() in regress.c (c8009d2) o Make load-dependent monotonic timer tests off-by-default (2b6fe8b) o Add deferred\_cb\_skew to list of timing-dependent tests (34c8f31) o Avoid test -e; older shs don't have one. (f1bd938) o Fix renegotiation test to work around openssl 1.0.1 bug (c2f3086) o Fix a couple of compile warnings in the unit tests (5a9a014)
MISC: o Change evutil\_weakrand\_() to avoid platform random() (e86af4b Nicholas Marriott, 3aa4415)
INFRASTRUCTURE (Active-later events): As a simplification and optimization to Libevent's "deferred callback" logic (introduced in 2.0 to avoid callback recursion), Libevent now treats all of its deferrable callback types using the same logic it uses for active events. Now deferred events no longer cause priority inversion, no longer require special code to cancel them, and so on.
 o Refactor the callback part of an event into its own event\_callback type (cba59e5) o Add "active later" event\_callbacks to supersede deferred (745a63d) o event\_base\_assert\_ok: check value of event\_active\_count for correctness (fec8bae) o Replace deferred\_cbs with event\_callback-based implementation. (ae2b84b) o Replace more deferred\_cb names with event\_callback (a4079aa) o Give event\_base\_process\_active a single exit path (581b5be) o Restore our priority-inversion-prevention code with deferreds (c0e425a) o Refactor event\_persist\_closure: raise and extract some common logic (bec22b4) o Remove the unused bits from EVLIST\_ALL (9889a3d)||||||| merged common ancestorsChanges in version 2.0.22-stable (?? Dec 2013)
 (As of 3b77d62829c4393bda6f9105a5d3b73b48a64b71.)
BUGFIXES (evhttp) o fix #73 and fix http\_connection\_fail\_test to catch it (crash fix) (b618204 Greg Hazel) o Avoid racy bufferevent activation (5eb1788 Nate Rosenblum)
BUGFIXES (compilation and portability) o Fix compilation with WIN32\_HAVE\_CONDITION\_VARIABLES enabled (7e45739) o Fix missing AC\_PROG\_SED on older Autoconfs (9ab2b3f Tay Ray Chuan)[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/raw/refs/tags/release-2.1.6-beta/ChangeLog)

## Description

[![@asn-d6](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3611450?u=dd4b7cfd93f60a1251af926f940906419219a0e3&v=4&size=48)](/asn-d6)[asn-d6](https://github.com/asn-d6)opened [on Jan 27, 2016](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/318#issue-129165996)

Hello,

in `evutil.c`:

```
1798     char buf[128];
...
...
1809     cp = strchr(ip_as_string, ':');
1810     if (*ip_as_string == '[') {
1811         int len;
1812         if (!(cp = strchr(ip_as_string, ']'))) {
1813             return -1;
1814         }
1815         len = (int) ( cp-(ip_as_string + 1) );
1816         if (len > (int)sizeof(buf)-1) {
1817             return -1;
1818         }
1819         memcpy(buf, ip_as_string+1, len);

```

Length between '[' and ']' is cast to signed 32 bit integer on line 1815. Is the length is more than 2<<31 (INT\_MAX), len will hold a negative value. Consequently, it will pass the check at line 1816. Segfault happens at line 1819.

Generate a resolv.conf with generate-resolv.conf, then compile and run poc.c. See entry-functions.txt for functions in tor that might be vulnerable.

Please credit 'Guido Vranken' for this discovery through the Tor bug bounty program.

## Description

[![@asn-d6](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3611450?u=dd4b7cfd93f60a1251af926f940906419219a0e3&v=4&size=48)](/asn-d6)[asn-d6](https://github.com/asn-d6)opened [on Mar 3, 2016](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/332#issue-138202528)

Here follows a bug report by **Guido Vranken** via the *Tor bug bounty program*. Please credit Guido accordingly.

## Bug report

The DNS code of Libevent contains this rather obvious OOB read:

```
3122 static char *
3123 search_make_new(const struct search_state *const state, int n, const char *const base_name) {
3124     const size_t base_len = strlen(base_name);
3125     const char need_to_append_dot = base_name[base_len - 1] == '.' ? 0 : 1;
```

If the length of `base_name` is 0, then line 3125 reads 1 byte before the buffer. This will trigger a crash on ASAN-protected builds.

To reproduce:

Build libevent with ASAN:

```
$ CFLAGS='-fomit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address' ./configure && make -j4

```

Put the attached `resolv.conf` and `poc.c` in the source directory and then do:

```
$ gcc -fsanitize=address -fomit-frame-pointer poc.c .libs/libevent.a
$ ./a.out
=================================================================
==22201== ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60060000efdf at pc 0x4429da bp 0x7ffe1ed47300 sp 0x7ffe1ed472f8
READ of size 1 at 0x60060000efdf thread T0

```

This happens because I create a zero-length string in `poc.c`:

```
    char* hostname = malloc(32);
    memset(hostname, 0, 32);
    //hostname[0] = 'x';
```

If you uncomment the last line, it will not crash.

Guido

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Subject: Bugs fixed in libevent 2.1.6

Libevent 2.1.6 fixed three bugs that may have security implications. Can
you assign CVE IDs as appropriate?

Below I quote from the upstream bug reports:

1) libevent dns remote stack overread vulnerability
------
the name_parse() function in libevent's DNS code is vulnerable to a
buffer overread.

971         if (cp != name_out) {
972             if (cp + 1 >= end) return -1;
973             *cp++ = '.';
974         }
975         if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;
976         memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);
977         cp += label_len;
978         j += label_len;

No check is made against length before the memcpy occurs.

2) libevent (stack) buffer overflow in evutil_parse_sockaddr_port()
------
in evutil.c:

1798     char buf[128];
...
...
1809     cp = strchr(ip_as_string, ':');
1810     if (*ip_as_string == '[') {
1811         int len;
1812         if (!(cp = strchr(ip_as_string, ']'))) {
1813             return -1;
1814         }
1815         len = (int) ( cp-(ip_as_string + 1) );
1816         if (len > (int)sizeof(buf)-1) {
1817             return -1;
1818         }
1819         memcpy(buf, ip_as_string+1, len);

Length between '[' and ']' is cast to signed 32 bit integer on line
1815. Is the length is more than 2<<31 (INT_MAX), len will hold a
negative value. Consequently, it will pass the check at line 1816.
Segfault happens at line 1819.

3) out-of-bounds read in search_make_new()
------
The DNS code of Libevent contains this rather obvious OOB read:

3122 static char *
3123 search_make_new(const struct search_state *const state, int n, const char *const base_name) {
3124     const size_t base_len = strlen(base_name);
3125     const char need_to_append_dot = base_name[base_len - 1] == '.' ? 0 : 1;

If the length of base_name is 0, then line 3125 reads 1 byte before the
buffer. This will trigger a crash on ASAN-protected builds.

## Description

[![@asn-d6](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3611450?u=dd4b7cfd93f60a1251af926f940906419219a0e3&v=4&size=48)](/asn-d6)[asn-d6](https://github.com/asn-d6)opened [on Jan 27, 2016](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/317#issue-129165354)

Hello,

the `name_parse()` function in libevent's DNS code is vulnerable to a buffer overread.

```
971         if (cp != name_out) {
972             if (cp + 1 >= end) return -1;
973             *cp++ = '.';
974         }
975         if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;
976         memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);
977         cp += label_len;
978         j += label_len;

```

No check is made against `length` before the `memcpy` occurs.

This was found through the Tor bug bounty program and the discovery should be credited to 'Guido Vranken'.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

@asn-the-goblin-slayer:
  "the name_parse() function in libevent's DNS code is vulnerable to a buffer overread.

   971         if (cp != name_out) {
   972             if (cp + 1 >= end) return -1;
   973             *cp++ = '.';
   974         }
   975         if (cp + label_len >= end) return -1;
   976         memcpy(cp, packet + j, label_len);
   977         cp += label_len;
   978         j += label_len;
   No check is made against length before the memcpy occurs.

   This was found through the Tor bug bounty program and the discovery should be credited to 'Guido Vranken'."
