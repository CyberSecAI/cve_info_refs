  "CVE-2016-10195": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in libevent with the parsing of DNS requests and replies. An attacker could send a forged DNS response to an application using libevent which could lead to reading data out of bounds on the heap, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory.",
    "root_cause": "The `name_parse()` function in libevent's DNS code is vulnerable to a buffer overread due to a missing length check before a memcpy operation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read on the heap"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could send a forged DNS response to an application using libevent, potentially disclosing a small amount of application memory.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted DNS response to an application using libevent.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft and send malicious DNS responses."
  },
  "CVE-2016-10196": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in libevent with the parsing of IPv6 addresses. If an attacker could cause an application using libevent to parse a malformed address in IPv6 notation of more than 2GiB in length, a stack overflow would occur leading to a crash.",
    "root_cause": "A stack-buffer overflow in the `evutil_parse_sockaddr_port()` function due to a missing size check in the length of an IPv6 address, caused by casting the size to a signed 32-bit integer.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack overflow leading to a crash can be triggered, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if stack canaries are not present.",
     "attack_vector": "By causing an application using libevent to parse a malformed address in IPv6 notation.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to control the input processed by libevent, specifically supplying a very large IPv6 address."
  },
   "CVE-2016-10197": {
    "description": "Libevent contains an out-of-bounds read in search_make_new().",
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read in the `search_make_new()` function of libevent's DNS code, due to a missing length check when accessing characters of a base name.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read on the heap"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash due to accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.",
    "attack_vector": "By providing a zero-length string as the base name during DNS processing.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to control the base name used in DNS processing."
