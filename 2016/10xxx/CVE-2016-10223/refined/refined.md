The provided content relates to CVE-2016-10223.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET["id"]` parameter when constructing a URL for editing module integrity issues. Specifically, the code directly inserts this parameter into a URL within a `href` attribute without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. By crafting a malicious value for the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
- Session hijacking
- Stealing sensitive information
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Defacing the website
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `$_GET["id"]` parameter in the URL. An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload embedded in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL used by the victim, typically by sending a crafted link via email, instant message, or other means. No specific user level is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
The provided commit `59ebef5978f80e2fdc7b4db4a28b668c5a39fbc3` fixes this by encoding the `$_GET["id"]` parameter using `htmlspecialchars()` function. This prevents the interpretation of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within the URL.
