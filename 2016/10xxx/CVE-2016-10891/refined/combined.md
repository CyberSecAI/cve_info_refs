## Description

**AN EASY TO USE & FULLY SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN**

Want to monitor and track your WordPress website activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website with this plugin. Activity Log is like an airplane’s black box that logs every action in the WordPress admin, and lets you see exactly what users are doing on your WordPress website.

* If someone is trying to hack your site
* When a post was published, and who published it
* If a plugin/theme was activated/deactivated
* Suspicious admin activity

It’s so essential; you’ll wonder how you ever managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn\’t affect site and admin performance. For optimal performance, we built the plugin so that it runs on a separate table in the database.

If you have more than a handful of users, keeping track of who did what is virtually impossible. This plugin solves that issue by tracking what actions were initiated by which users, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and easy-to-filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

**New! Introducing Email Logging** – Capture all emails sent from your WordPress site for streamlined debugging and compliance. Gain better visibility into email communication, aiding both troubleshooting and record-keeping. This is particularly beneficial for WooCommerce stores, allowing you to easily track sent emails alongside other critical site events.

**Export to CSV** – Export your Activity Log data records to CSV. Developers can easily add support for custom data formats with our new dedicated Export API.

**Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance** – We provide the tools to help you adhere to GDPR compliance standards, including Export/Erasure of data via the WordPress Privacy Tools.

### With the Activity Log you can record:

* **WordPress** – Core updates
* **Posts** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Pages** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Custom Post Type** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Tags** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Categories** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Taxonomies** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Menus** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Media** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Comments** – Created, approved, unapproved, trashed, untrashed, spammed, unspammed, deleted
* **Users** – Login, logout, login failed, update profile, registered, deleted
* **Plugins** – Installed, updated, activated, deactivated, changed
* **Themes** – Installed, updated, deleted, activated, changed (Editor and Customizer)
* **Widgets** – Added to sidebar, deleted from sidebar, order widgets
* **Setting** – General, writing, reading, discussion, media, permalinks
* **Options** – Extended custom settings for 3rd party plugins
* **Export** – Exported activity log file
* **WooCommerce** – Track products, orders, customers, and more
* **bbPress** – Forums, topics, replies, taxonomies, and other actions
* **Emails sent from WordPress site** – Sending successful, sending failed
* There’s more, of course, but you get the point…

For each event recorded by the activity log, the following details are also logged:

* Date and time of occurrence
* User and user role responsible for the change
* Source IP address from which the change originated
* Affected object where the change occurred

The plugin doesn\’t require any kind of setup; it works right out of the box (just another reason people love it)!

### Data Storage and Performance Optimization

In order to ensure optimal performance of your website, all events and logs data are stored in a dedicated custom table within your WordPress database. This approach significantly reduces the impact on your website’s performance, ensuring seamless operation even during peak traffic periods.

### Uninstall Clean-up

We understand the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient database environment. That’s why our plugin features an uninstall hook that seamlessly removes all traces of its presence from your website when uninstalling. This meticulous clean-up process ensures that your database remains lean and clutter-free even after our plugin has been removed.

**With our optimized data storage, thorough logging, and meticulous clean-up process, you can trust that our plugin will enhance the functionality and security of your WordPress site without compromising its performance.**

Being able to see what preceded an error on a website is so immensely helpful that you cannot imagine it before you actually try it.
Especially when working with clients. So many times have we been able to identify the cause of an issue, as we could see that “Oh, this person edited that page last Monday” or “Aha, function x stopped working after updating plugin y”.
It’s also valuable to check if someone else is working on a website, before making major changes, not disturbing each of the others work.
Activity Log is installed on all my websites, and has been for years. It fills a gap that, weirdly enough, is present in a CMS that encourages multiple users and roles.
Highly recommended. Five stars easily ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Greate user logs to go back in time to see who have done something wrong. In my opinion, this is a must plugin

### [Simple and Powerful Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-and-powerful-plugin-13/)

I have installed this plugin on all my clients websites which helps me keep track of who did what making troubleshooting any issues quick and simple when something goes wrong.
I could have created a similar plugin myself, but what’s the point when the authors of Activity Log have already done such a great job? So, instead, I coded a script to send the info from this plugin to a central database where I can keep an eye on all client sites in one place, which is definitely easier than checking each one individually.
The only thing that is kind of annoying about this plugin is the Elementor ad a the top of the admin back-end. I am a big fan of Elementor for certain types of sites and use it on many sites, but I don’t need or want my clients to see these ads because it looks very unprofessional.
I certainly don’t mind having ads there if they support the authors in keeping plugins updated, but it can be quite annoying when they are, as the phrase goes, “in your face”.
