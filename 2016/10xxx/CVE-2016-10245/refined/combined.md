| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=762934#c0)  bjonkman.nrel    2016-03-01 17:31:48 UTC  ``` We used server-side searching (both SEARCHENGINE and SERVER_BASED_SEARCH are YES in the config file and EXTERNAL_SEARCH is NO), and had our cyber security guys check for vulnerabilities in the generated HTML.  The assessment showed "an injection vulnerability allowing me to exploit reflected XSS (a vulnerability that an attacker could use to launch attacks against the website, or other users), and iframe injection (a vulnerability that allows an attacker to import a website of their choice and/or under their control)."  The problem appears to be in search_opensearch.php, where the user-supplied data is not properly escaped. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=762934#c1)  Dimitri van Heesch    2016-03-25 18:57:49 UTC  ``` Confirmed. Should be fixed in the next GIT update. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=762934#c2)  Dimitri van Heesch    2016-09-05 13:45:13 UTC  ``` This bug was previously marked ASSIGNED, which means it should be fixed in doxygen version 1.8.12. Please verify if this is indeed the case. Reopen the bug if you think it is not fixed and please include any additional information  that you think can be relevant (preferably in the form of a self-contained example). ``` |  |
