{
  "CVE-2016-10745": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of the `str.format` method in Jinja2, which allows for information disclosure and sandbox escape.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Sandbox escape due to information disclosure via str.format"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can escape the Jinja2 sandbox, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, and compromise system confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted template strings using the `str.format` method that Jinja2 fails to sanitize correctly.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or inject template strings that are then processed by Jinja2."
