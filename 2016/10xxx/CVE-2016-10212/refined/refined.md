{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a bug in third-party code where the first two SSL encrypted data records use a fixed explicit Initialization Vector (IV) and the third SSL encrypted data record and onwards uses a fixed randomized IV, violating the requirement for unique IVs in AES-GCM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a fixed explicit IV for the first two SSL encrypted records.",
      "Use of a fixed randomized IV for the subsequent records.",
      "Incorrect implementation of AES-GCM in TLS 1.2."
    ],
    "impact": "Violation of the authenticity of affected HTTPS connections. This allows for the injection of seemingly valid content into encrypted sessions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack.",
      "Exploitation of TLS 1.2 connections using AES-GCM with vulnerable implementations."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate TLS traffic between a client and a server using a vulnerable implementation of AES-GCM.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerability was reported to Radware by security researcher Hanno BÃ¶ck. Affected vendors include Radware, IBM, A10 Networks, and Citrix."
