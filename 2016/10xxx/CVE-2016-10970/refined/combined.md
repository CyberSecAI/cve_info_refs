### [Nothing more than the most important features](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/nothing-more-than-the-most-important-features/)

Finally a simple plugin for ticketing that uses posts types and user roles in WordPress the proper way! I can’t wait to integrate it in our network! Yay!
Disclaimer: I haven’t tested the email notifications and ticket creation yet.

Running PHP7 and 4.5-alpha-36246 and I just wanted to say that everything works great! Although I can’t read & write code at 100% fluency, I just wanted to post over here so that the theme authors would know that Yes Indeed! Everything’s looking great!

An attacker could submit the following payload via `[supportflow_submissionform]` to perform cross-site-scripting:

`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
