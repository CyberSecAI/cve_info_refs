Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `login.php` script in Synology Photo Station does not properly sanitize the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a system call.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `synophoto_dsm_user` binary has the setuid bit set, allowing any user to execute it with root privileges. This binary does not properly validate user-supplied arguments when copying files, allowing a low-privilege user to overwrite the `/etc/crontab` file which controls scheduled tasks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The Photo Station application trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` header without any validation, leading to command injection via the `system()` function.
*   **Setuid Misuse:** The `synophoto_dsm_user` binary is setuid root and allows insecure copy operations with the `--copy-no-ea` option, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** Allows arbitrary command execution as the `http` user (uid 1023).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Allows arbitrary command execution with root privileges by overwriting the `/etc/crontab` file, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** By crafting a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header in an HTTP request to the `login.php` page.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** By leveraging the setuid binary `synophoto_dsm_user` with crafted arguments to overwrite `/etc/crontab`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Synology Photo Station.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as guest users are vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Photo Station versions <= 6.3-2954.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 6.3-2958.
*   The vulnerability was reported on 2015/09/23 and patched on 2015/10/01.
