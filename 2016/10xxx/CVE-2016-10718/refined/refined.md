Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Brave browser's failure to restrict the `window.close()` JavaScript function. Specifically, a webpage could call `window.close()` to close a tab/window, even if that tab/window was not opened by that specific script, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted `window.close()`:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper restrictions on the `window.close()` function. Unlike Chrome, Brave did not enforce the limitation that only scripts that opened a window can close it.
*   **Inadequate tab/window restoration logic:** When a single tab was closed with `window.close()` and Brave browser was subsequently reopened, the closed tab was incorrectly restored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this flaw, a malicious webpage can remotely close a user's tab (or window if it is the last open tab), causing the browser to restore the same malicious page/tab on restart, effectively creating a persistent denial of service. The user is then trapped, unable to use the browser.
*   **Resource Consumption:** The issue can lead to excessive resource consumption if the malicious page attempts further actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** The attack is initiated by a malicious webpage containing the `window.close(self);` javascript.
*   **User Interaction:** Initially the user was required to click on a link on the malicious webpage. However, the vulnerability can be triggered automatically by removing the click action from the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage or inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to be able to host the malicious webpage and lure the user to visit it or to find a way to inject the malicious code into a page the user visits.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
*   The issue was present in Brave browser versions prior to 0.13.0 (specifically mentioned version 0.12.5)
*   The vulnerability is described as impacting both Windows and Linux.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `DOMWindow::close` implementation within the browser's rendering engine.
*   The fix involved blocking window.close unless the script also opened the tab and fixing the tab restoration logic

**In summary**, CVE-2016-10718 describes a vulnerability in the Brave browser which allowed a malicious webpage to close itself via the window.close function. Further, the browser then incorrectly restores the page on restart, creating a denial of service condition, making it hard for users to use their browser. The lack of restrictions on `window.close` and flawed tab restoration were the primary weaknesses.
