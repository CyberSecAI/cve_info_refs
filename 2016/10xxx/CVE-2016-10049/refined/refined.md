Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2016-10049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `ReadRLEImage` function in `coders/rle.c` of ImageMagick. Specifically, there's an issue related to how the code handles pixel offsets when reading Run-Length Encoded (RLE) image files. The code calculates the size of a memory allocation based on the number of color planes in the image. However, when reading the actual image data, the code iterates through the image data and uses a pointer `p` to read colormap indices, and uses a `index` variable that's validated with the `ValidateColormapValue` function. The vulnerability exists because this index could be computed to be out of bounds due to a negative offset during decoding of a specially crafted RLE file, which then is used to write to memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow. When processing a corrupted RLE file, the calculated index during color map validation goes out of bounds which leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Segmentation Fault / Crash:** A successful exploit can lead to a segmentation fault, causing the ImageMagick application to crash.
-   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated in the provided text, heap-based buffer overflows can potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution in some circumstances by overwriting critical data structures in memory, given the right conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted RLE image file. An attacker needs to provide this crafted image file as input to ImageMagick through one of its processing tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted RLE image file to ImageMagick. This could be via direct command line usage of ImageMagick tools (e.g. `identify`, `convert`) or indirectly through other software using the library.
-   **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

-   The provided information includes a stack trace demonstrating the crash within the `ReadRLEImage` function, pinpointing the vulnerable area of code.
-   The fix involves changing the size calculation and adding a check during color map validation, ensuring that index does not become negative. The fix was made in the commit [13db820](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/13db820f5e24cd993ee554e99377fea02a904e18) and [3e91652](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/3e9165285eda6e1bb71172031d3048b51bb443a4).
- The Debian bug tracker entry confirms this as a grave security issue fixed in  `imagemagick/8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u4` and `imagemagick/8:6.9.5.9+dfsg-1`.
-   The discussion on the ImageMagick forum highlights the initial report, reproduction, and confirmation of the fix.

In summary, CVE-2016-10049 is a heap-based buffer overflow in ImageMagick's RLE image processing code. An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by providing a crafted RLE image file, potentially causing a crash and, in some circumstances, arbitrary code execution.
