## Description

We started the Podlove Podcast Publisher project in 2012 because existing solutions were stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher](https://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher)

### Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher

### Compatible RSS Feeds

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

### Multi-Format Publishing

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing – embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs – a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

### Optimized Web Player

The Publisher also comes integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin and fully supports its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible and is ready for all touch based clients too.

### Metadata Galore

* **Chapter Marks:** The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.
* **Contributors:** Bring your team and guests front and center. Manage contributors, including their names, avatars and web urls.
* **Transcripts:** WebVTT transcripts can be imported and even connected to your contributors. They are referenced in the RSS feed so they can be displayed by podcast apps.
* **Seasons:** Does your podcast have seasons? We got you covered with a dedicated “Seasons” module.
* **Related Episodes:** Manage and display related episodes on your website.

### Auphonic Integration

Auphonic is your all-in-one audio post production webtool to achieve a professional quality result. We provide a first class integration module for ease of use and best automation experience.

### Flexible Templates

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

## FAQ

### Is Podlove Podcast Publisher free?

Yes! The core features of Podlove Podcast Publisher are and always will be free.

### Are there Download Statistics?

Yes! Podcast Downloads can be tracked and analyzed. You can easily see how many people downloaded you podcast episodes, which clients they used, if they prefer to subscribe to the feed or listen on your website using the web player—and much more.

### Are there Privacy / GDPR considerations?

Podlove Publisher is GDPR compliant and provides prewritten text snippets for your privacy page. See https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/guides/dsgvo-gdpr.html

### Where can I host my podcast files?

Any storage where you have control over the file naming is compatible with Podlove Podcast Publisher. You can manage files using a simple FTP/sFTP or use services like Amazon S3.

### Where can I ask questions and get support?

Free support where questions are answered by the community is available in the [Podlove Community Forum](http://community.podlove.org/). There is a German community in the [Sendegate](https://sendegate.de/).

### How can I help the project?

The continued success of Open Source project relies on the community. There are many ways you can help:

Episode title in API now follows the same rules as in RSS feed. There’s a new field ‘title\_clean’ for accessing the specifically set plain episode title, but that might be null in some cases, so it’s better to default the ‘title’ attribute to the usual rules.

Set this up for a client but every page / every shortcode – there were bugs and design flaws. Very hard to use.

This is one of the most solid podcast plugins out there. It’s cleanly coded, not a bunch of jenky ads all over the place, and does the job very well.
One thing I’d love to see is the ability to have a Dashboard Widget of my stats when I login to my WordPress Dashboard (as opposed to the Podlove Dashboard). Plus, it would be amazing to have a way to have weekly podcast stats emailed to contributors!
Thanks so much for your continued development of this fantastic plugin!

## Changelog

#### 4.2.0

This release introduces the all-new **Onboarding Assistant**, enabling you to

either setup a new podcast or move your existing podcast to Podlove with just

your RSS Feed URL.

This makes it much easier for potential podcasters to get started, as it makes

the initial setup process as simple and quick as possible, now only requiring

the podcaster to define what’s really necessary about the podcast, without

needing to worry about technical details.

And for the first time, you can now move any of your existing podcasts to

Podlove Publisher. All you need is the RSS feed. Podlove Publisher finds all the

episode data and metadata like the audio file, title, description, chapters,

transcript and contributors and imports them automatically.

A huge Thank You goes to the [Prototype

Fund](https://prototypefund.de/project/podlove-publisher-onboarding-import-assistant/)

for sponsoring the development of the Onboarding Assistant module.

* changes in an episode immediately affect the RSS feed

There are various caches in place to ensure efficient delivery of the RSS feed

to podcast clients. However it can be hard to guess how long it will take for a

change to appear in the feed and podcatchers. Now, any change to the episode

metadata or enabling/disabling an asset immediately clears the cache for that

feed item, resulting in the change to be visible in the RSS feed immediately.

* transcripts: polish timestamp rendering in preview (shorter, monospaced, right aligned, unselectable)
* chapters: fix “unknown” durations

#### 4.1.1

* security: add nonces to tools actions

#### 4.1.0

**Feature: Better control over transcripts in RSS feed**

There is a new feature under `Podlove > Podcast Feeds` called “Episode

Transcripts” to control how episode transcripts should be referenced in your RSS

feed. The default is “Publisher Generated vtt”, which is nearly the same

behavior as before (In previous versions, three variants were referenced: vtt,

json and srt. The json and srt URLs still work but they are not referenced in

the RSS feed any more as they are not neccessary and removing them reduces feed

size). There is a dedicated “Do not include in feed” option, in case you do not

want the transcripts in your RSS feed.

Finally, you may prefer to host your transcript assets externally, just like

your audio files. If you have configured a transcript asset, you can now select

it in this setting. Then the RSS feed will reference this external file

directly.

**Auphonic improvements**

* add button to always access the import screen
* add button to delete a track
* show status in production selection
* rearrange / polish various some button and information positions

**Other**

* add: capability “podlove\_manage\_contributors” for contributors settings screens
* fix: sometimes missing voices in Podlove Web Player transcripts
* fix: sometimes an enabled asset is disabled a few moments later
* fix: show files as “not found” when they become unreachable
* transcripts: rename “delete” action to “clear”
* transcripts: show timestamps in editor preview
* upgrade heroicons (icon library) from v1 to v2

Changes for previous versions can be found in the [`changelog.txt`](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/blob/master/changelog.txt).

Podlove Publisher 4.0 is here, bringing a spring-clean (in November!) of the episode page. We tore up the foundation to bring you an all-new user interface.
\*\*Warning:\*\* PHP 8.0 and above is now required!
\*\*Highlights\*\*
- \*\*Episode Form\*\* User Interface is modernised and auto-saves, so no work is ever lost.- \*\*Auphonic module\*\* includes Multitrack Support.- \*\*New Contributors\*\* can be added without leaving the episode page.- \*\*Chapters\*\* support images.- \*\*REST API V2\*\* is now, including many more endpoints. See the [API documentation](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/api) for all the details.
\*\*Tidbits\*\*
- file “slug” field is prefixed with the media location so it’s more obvious what it is used for- episode duration is always auto-detected and not an input field any more- Auphonic Preset can be selected directly in the episode and does not rely on global module setting any more- removed module “Twitter Card Integration” (RIP). By the way, if you want to follow us on social media, find us here: https://fosstodon.org/@podlove- fix various PHP notices and warnings to be PHP 8.0+ compatible
= 3.8.11, 3.8.12 =
\* fix: templates XHR issue in WP MultiSite\* fix: lists UI in WP MultiSite
= 3.8.10 =
\* fix: templates UI in WP MultiSite
= 3.8.9 =
\* fix broken encoding when saving episode meta
= 3.8.8 =
\* fix broken RSS feeds
= 3.8.7 =
\* improve PHP 8 compatibility \* stop using FILTER\_SANITIZE\_STRING \* set default encoding in DOMDocument \* set default values in transcript template internals
\* fix(plus): gracefully handle when things go wrong in image generator\* fix(shownotes): handle image providers returning lists\* fix subtle `get\_the\_excerpt` bug (uses post parameter now instead of the global post object)
= 3.8.6 =
\* fix incompatibilities with matomo plugin ([#1308](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1308))
= 3.8.5 =
\* fix PHP notice on episode screen
= 3.8.4 =
\* fix CSRF vulnerabilities by adding nonces to forms
= 3.8.3 =
\* fix XSS vulnerability
= 3.8.2 =
\* add support for op3.dev using the "External Analytics" module\* update OPAWG data (for download analytics / user agent detection)\* improve PHP 8.1 compatibility
= 3.8.1 =
\* fix(api): episode title -- Episode title in API now follows the same rules as in RSS feed. There's a new field 'title\_clean' for accessing the specifically set plain episode title, but that might be null in some cases, so it's better to default the 'title' attribute to the usual rules.\* fix: auphonic preset for show applies after saving the episode\* fix: remove debug error log for a shows analytics query
= 3.8.0 =
\*\*New module: Automatic Numbering\*\*
Automatically increase the Episode number when creating episodes.When using the "Shows" module, each show has its own numbering.
This module is active by default for new setups.To use it in your current setup, go to `Podlove > Modules`, search for "Automatic Numbering" and activate it.
\*\*Other Changes:\*\*
- Shows Module: each show can define its own Auphonic production preset- episode: after file revalidation, auto-detect duration- contributors: assign a `Sponsor` role and it will appear as `<podcast:person ... role="sponsor">...` in the RSS feed- fix: correct PHP version number in message (https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1272)- fix: feed cache issue when using the "Shows" module
= 3.7.0 =
\*\*Shownotes\*\*
The Shownotes module helps you manage link based show notes to display on your website and podcatchers.
The module UI has been rewritten and streamlined for efficient workflows.A new UI element was added to allow for quickly sorting long lists of links into topics:Whenever a link is dragged, a floating list of all topics appears next to the cursor.The link can then be dropped under the desired topic there instead of scrolling through the whole list of shownotes.
Disclaimer: URL metadata detection uses a service hosted at [plus.podlove.org](https://plus.podlove.org). It is currently available for all users of Podlove Publisher. In the future, metadata detection may only be availabe to Publisher PLUS users as it requires infrastructure to run. The rest of the Shownotes functionality will stay available to all Podlove users as usual.
Documentation: https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/modules/shownotes
\*\*Contributors\*\*
\* Notifications: add "always send to..." section. Contributors selected there will always receive update notifications.\* Avatars: default avatar is now a static svg instead of Gravatar (can be customized using the WordPress Filter `podlove\_default\_contributor\_avatar\_url`)
\*\*Enhancements for creating Auphonic productions\*\* (thanks [lumaxis](https://github.com/lumaxis)!):
\* when the episode title is set, send this instead of the post title ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))\* send the episode number as track number ([#1240](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1240))\* when the post thumbnail is configured as cover image, use it as direct fallback ([#1241](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1241))
\*\*Webhooks\*\*
Define a webhook that gets triggered every time an episode updates.
The webhook is a `POST` request with an `event` parameter and a `payload`.`event` is the webhook name ("episode\_updated"), `payload` is a serializedJSON object of the current episode.
Configuration:
 # wp-config.php define('PODLOVE\_WEBHOOKS', [ 'episode\_updated' => 'https://example.com/webhook-endpoint' ]);
\*\*Other Changes\*\*
\* soundbites: add title field ([#1257](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1257), [#1237](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1237))\* allow detection of episode duration on mp4 ([#1249](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/pull/1249))\* update OPAWG data (for download analytics / user agent detection)
\*\*Fixes\*\*
\* fix: parameters for shortcode `[podlove-episode-contributor-list]` ([#1233](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1233))\* fix: PHP 8 warnings ([#1258](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1258))\* fix: deleting an episode deletes its transcript from the database ([#1252](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1252))\* fix(contributors): notification test email ([#1247](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1247))\* fix(analytics): filtering of httprange requests with one or two bytes ([#1243](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1243))\* fix(image cache): redirect to source URL if image can't be downloaded into the cache
= 3.6.1 =
\* fix: sql issue when creating the episode database tables
= 3.6.0 =
\*\*New Module: Soundbite\*\*
Adds support for the `<podcast:soundbite>` RSS feed tag.The intended use includes episodes previews, discoverability, audiogram generation, episode highlights, etc.
Using this module you can specify an audio segment for each episode that can be read by for example audiogram generation services.
\*\*New Module: WordPress File Upload\*\*
If you are using WordPress Media as storage for your Podlove assets, this newmodule adds conveniences.
First, you define a `Upload subdirectory` for your Podlove assets. This overridesany WordPress settings, so for example you can safely enable the typical date/monthstructure for WordPress attachments and it will not affect your Podlove Uploads.
Then you can update your "Podlove - Media - Upload Location" setting. You can keepit empty to let Podlove Publisher take care of it, or set it yourself if you havea custom file hostname.
Now there is an "Upload Media File" button in your episode form abovethe "Episode Media File Slug" where you can directly upload your files.If you are using multiple assets, you can upload them all there. Just make surethey all have the same filename (except the file extension) before you upload.
= 3.5.5, 3.5.6 =

This releases reverses all changes to Permalinks in releases 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.
I severely underestimated the effect these changes would have and revert all changes until I find a better solution. It’s simply not acceptable to change episode URLs, especially without an option for automatic redirects.
Please verify your episode URLs and the two expert settings “Permalink structure for episodes” and “Episode Pages”.
What to do if you have used the “PODLOVE\_ENABLE\_PERMALINK\_MAGIC” constant? It has no effect any more and you can safely remove it from your config file.
What happened to the “Simple Episode Permalink” setting from release 3.5.1? It has been removed, too.
Sorry for the trouble.Happy podcasting :)

\* fix: remove usage of PHP 7.1 syntax in one file

\* add: expert setting to make episode permalinks `/%postname%/`\* add: include Publisher Database Version in system report\* drop WordPress version requirement to 4.9.6
= 3.5.0 =
\*\*Breaking Change\*\*
Removes two expert settings:
\* "Permalink structure for episodes" and\* "Episode pages"
These settings allowed to define custom URL structures for episodes and the episode archive.However they have caused trouble for a long time (see [#1038](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher/issues/1038))and the only viable way out seems to remove them.
How does that affect you?
If you have never touched these settings, feel free to shrug, smile and move on.
If you \_are\_ using these settings, I encourage you to consider not using them as they are mostly of cosmetic nature.Should you however prefer to keep everything as is (including the known bugs of erratically broken permalinks / URLs), you canenable the settings back with a single line of code in your wp-config.php:
 `define('PODLOVE\_ENABLE\_PERMALINK\_MAGIC', true);`
\*\*Experimental: Full-Page Podlove Templates\*\*
If you want to create a 100% custom page based on an episode but without all the WordPress theme around, this is for you.Possible use case: A dedicated page to print the episode transcript.
1. create a new Podlove Template, for example `page-episode-transcipt`2. Write that transcript as a \_full HTML page\_. That means it starts with `<!doctype html><html>` and ends with `</html>`!3. Append `?podlove\_template\_page=page-episode-transcipt` to your public episode URL. For example if your episode is `https://example.com/ep001/`, then open `https://example.com/ep001/?podlove\_template\_page=page-episode-transcipt`
Very simple example template:
 <!doctype html> <html>
 <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> <title>Transcript | {{ episode.title }} | {{ podcast.title }}</title> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> </head>
 <body>
 <p> Here's the transcript for podcast <strong>{{ podcast.title }}</strong> episode <strong>{{ episode.title }}</strong>: </p>
 [podlove-transcript]
 </body>
 </html>
Enjoy!

\*\*New Publisher PLUS\*\*
=> [plus.podlove.org](https://plus.podlove.org/)
Publisher PLUS is a new service providing Feed Proxy and Podcast Subscriber statistics for Podlove Publisher.

Subscriber Statistics are only the beginning. Expect more features soon!
\*\*Experimental: Shownotes\*\*
Generate and manage episode show notes. Helps you provide rich metadata for URLs. Full support for Publisher Templates.
This module is a work-in-progress. But it's usable, so feel free to give it a try, especially if your shownotes are link-heavy and you're comfortable writing Podlove (Twig) templates.
The module is currently hidden. Make it visible by setting a PHP constant, for example in your `wp-config.php`: `define('PODLOVE\_MODULE\_SHOWNOTES\_VISBLE', true);`.

\*\*IAB Conformity\*\*
When it comes to tracking download intents, Podlove Publisher was always close to IAB recommendations, with one exception: the time window in which two requests count as two. Podlove Publisher deduplicates by hour, IAB recommends a day.
There is a new setting in `Podlove > Expert Settings > Tracking`: "Deduplication Window". It enables you to change the window to "day". This is an opt-in setting, the default will continue to be hourly.

\*\*Transcripts\*\*
“Transcripts” is the new module to manage transcripts, show them on your site and in the web player. You can import them from webvtt files. If you are already using the Podlove Publisher contributors, you can assign people to the voices inside the webvtt. Then you even get avatars automatically in your transcripts.
See [https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/](https://forschergeist.de/podcast/fg066-klimaneutralitaet/) for an example episode with transcripts in the web player.
\*\*Transcripts: Shortcode\*\*
The shortcode `[podlove-transcript]` displays a pretty html version of the transcript for your website.
\*\*Transcripts: Twig Template Support\*\*
Of course there is a fully featured template API for transcripts as well. For example:
{% for group in episode.transcript %} <div class="ts-group">
 <div class="ts-speaker-avatar"> {{ group.contributor.image.html({width: 50}) }} </div>
 <div class="ts-text"> <div class="ts-speaker"> {{ group.contributor.name }} </div>
 <div class="ts-content"> {% for line in group.items %} <span class="ts-line">{{ line.content }}</span> {% endfor %} </div> </div>
 </div>{% endfor %}
See [https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html](https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/reference/template-tags.html "documentation") for all details.
\*\*Global Podcast Analytics\*\*
The following metrics are now available for the whole podcast:
- downloads per month- top episodes- episode asset- podcast client- operating system- download source
\*\*Raw Analytics\*\*
I wouldn’t call this an Analytics API but since it exists to power the analytics screen, I might as well document it. The following endpoints return results in CSV format for easy processing or import to spreadsheets.
Here is an example call that returns the number of downloads in March 2019:
 https://your.domain/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month&date\_from=2019-03-01T00:00:00.000Z&date\_to=2019-03-31T23:59:59.999Z
All requests take the same three parameters:
- `action` defines what data you want- `date\_from` is the start date in ISO 8601- `date\_end` is the end date in ISO 8601
Available actions are:
- podlove-analytics-global-downloads-per-month- podlove-analytics-global-top-episodes- podlove-analytics-global-assets- podlove-analytics-global-clients- podlove-analytics-global-systems- podlove-analytics-global-sources
You need to be logged in with admin permissions for the requests to work.
Disclaimer: Depending on the popularity of your podcast and chosen date range, the requests may take a long time to respond, or even fail if the calculation takes longer than the timeout defined in your web server.

\*\*Downloads Data Export\*\*
Download data per episode can now be exported as JSON and CSV.On the Analytics page you will now find a simple export interface.Select the episodes you want in the export or don't select any to export them all at once.
\*\*WP REST API Support\*\*
Backbone for the data export is an implementation of the WP REST API.
Endpoint for the episode custom post type:
- /wp-json/wp/v2/episodes
Custom endpoints for episode analytics:
- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/123- /wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/123,82
All analytics are available as CSV by adding `?format=csv` as parameter, for example `/wp-json/podlove/v1/analytics/episodes/?format=csv`
Analytics endpoints require the `podlove\_read\_analytics` permission, the same as viewing analytics in the admin.
Please read https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/ if you want to use these endpoints.

Update 2.7.5 changed the way download tracking works to comply with GDPR. We tried the radical approach and anonymized IPs. As it turns out, this is not viable. Download numbers are skewed by this change and often much lower than they realistically should be. If you saw a drop in downloads since updating to 2.7.5 or 2.7.6, this is the reason.
The good news is that this update changes download tracking again and new download numbers should get back to normal. The bad news is that the data since the GDPR update cannot be fixed/restored because it's missing data granularity -- which was the point of the change; just not anitcipating the effect on the actual download numbers.
So what's the new tracking approach?
Podlove Publisher now stores the `request\_id` again just like before the update: a hash based on the actual IP address and the user agent. What's new is that now once a day, all `request\_id`s older than 24 hours are salted again, making it impossible to restore IPs from them. This 24 hour window is enough to determine download numbers exactly as before the GDPR update.
To be clear, IPs are never stored in plain text. But since IPs could be restored by brute force attack from the temporary unsalted `request\_id` hashes, they have to be treated like plain IPs. The text snippet for your privacy page has been updated in the docs and you should update it on your site: https://docs.podlove.org/podlove-publisher/guides/dsgvo-gdpr.html
