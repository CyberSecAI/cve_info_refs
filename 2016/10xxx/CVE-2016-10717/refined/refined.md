The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in whitelisting implementations of various security products, with a specific focus on Malwarebytes Anti-Malware consumer version 2.2.1 and prior.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect permissions and hardcoded encryption in Malwarebytes' whitelisting mechanism.

*   **Root Cause:** The `exclusions.dat` file, which controls the whitelisting feature, is encrypted using a hardcoded key. Additionally, the file permissions grant full control to the locally logged-on user.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   **Hardcoded Encryption Key:**  The same key is used across all installations, allowing anyone with access to the key to decrypt and modify the whitelist.
    *   **Incorrect Permissions:**  A standard user can modify the whitelist, bypassing the intended security controls.
    *   **No Write Lock:** The exclusion files can be modified even when the program is running.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can overwrite the `exclusions.dat` file with a modified version that whitelists malicious files and websites.
    *   This allows the execution of unauthorized applications, including malware, and access to malicious websites, effectively bypassing the protection offered by Malwarebytes.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Obtain a copy of Malwarebytes (trial version is sufficient).
    2.  Install it and whitelist a benign application.
    3.  Copy the generated `exclusions.dat` file.
    4.  Modify this file to include the malicious files/URLs the attacker wants to whitelist.
    5.  Overwrite the target system's `exclusions.dat` with the modified version.
    6.  Restart the Malwarebytes service or processes for the new whitelist to take effect.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs local access to the system to overwrite the `exclusions.dat` file.
    *   No administrative privileges are required because of the weak file permissions.

**Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in Malwarebytes 3.0.4.

The provided GitHub repository contains a proof-of-concept (POC) Python script (`mbam-whitelist-poc.txt`) that demonstrates this vulnerability. The script overwrites a valid `exclusions.dat` file with a crafted one, permitting malicious files to run.
