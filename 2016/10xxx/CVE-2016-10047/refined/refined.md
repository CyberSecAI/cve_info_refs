Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the way ImageMagick handles XML file traversal. Specifically, it's related to how the `NewXMLTree` function parses XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak within the XML parsing logic. This means that memory is allocated but not properly released during the processing of a malicious XML file.
*   **Path Traversal:** While not the primary issue, the commit message and associated code changes suggest that path traversal was also a concern that was being addressed at the same time. The vulnerability allowed for loading arbitrary modules from user side, and a fix was implemented to prevent unauthorized coder path traversal, although the primary issue of this CVE was memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion on the server processing the crafted image. Repeated exploitation will eventually consume all available memory, causing denial-of-service by either crashing the application or forcing the system to swap extensively
*   **Potential Instability:**  Uncontrolled memory consumption can make the system unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image Upload:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading or providing a maliciously crafted image file containing a specially constructed XML structure.
*   **Image Processing:** When ImageMagick attempts to process the malicious image, the vulnerable XML parsing code is triggered, leading to the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to ImageMagick for processing. This could be done by uploading an image to a website, or through an application that uses the ImageMagick library to process images provided as input.
*   **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation doesn't require any special privileges or access beyond the ability to submit input to an affected system.

**Technical Details**

*   **Code Change:** The relevant code changes in `magick/module.c` add a check for `../` in the module path to prevent path traversal, and `magick/xml-tree.c` changes the logic of the function `ParseOpenTag`, to avoid an infinite loop when encountering a closing tag, which caused a memory leak.
*   **Specific Commit:** The fix for the memory leak was introduced in the commit `fc6080f1321fd21e86ef916195cc110b05d9effb`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug was reported as CVE-2016-10047 and was reported by Masaaki Chida
*   Red Hat rated the issue as having a Low security impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version 6.9.4-7.
*   The issue was also reported in Debian as bug #833732
