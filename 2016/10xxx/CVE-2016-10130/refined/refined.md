  "CVE-2016-10130": {
    "description": "The http_connect function in transports/http.c in libgit2 before 0.24.6 and 0.25.x before 0.25.1 might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers by leveraging clobbering of the error variable.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `http_connect` function in `transports/http.c` clobbers the error variable before checking the validity of the certificate, potentially leading to a MITM attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling in certificate validation logic.",
         "The certificate check callback always reports a valid certificate, regardless of its actual status."
       ],
      "impact": "Man-in-the-middle attacks are possible, allowing an attacker to spoof servers by providing invalid certificates that would be treated as valid due to the error variable clobbering.",
      "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts the connection between the client and the server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be positioned in the network to intercept and modify traffic between the client and the server."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
        "libgit2 before 0.24.6",
        "libgit2 0.25.x before 0.25.1"
