### @scott113341 **[scott113341](/scott113341)** commented [Oct 25, 2016](#issue-185240346)

Hello, thanks for all your work on IPFS. Really cool project!

This PR makes the download run over HTTPS (important when downloading binaries!!!). It also improves the test by removing the `go-ipfs` directory before the test starts. Before, the directory was preserved between runs, which could have resulted in false positives.

Sorry, something went wrong.
