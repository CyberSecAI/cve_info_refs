{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the CALS coder (coders/tiff.c) of ImageMagick. Specifically, a missing check on the size of an input parameter leads to a buffer overflow when writing a GROUP4 compressed image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A maliciously crafted file could cause the application to crash or possibly have other impact such as arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted image file.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to a vulnerable instance of ImageMagick"
  },
  "fixes": [

       "description": "This commit fixes a buffer overflow in the coders/tiff.c by adding a size check before allocating a buffer for the output of the  WriteGROUP4Image function."
