## Description

[![@asarubbo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4741819?v=4&size=48)](/asarubbo)[asarubbo](https://github.com/asarubbo)opened [on Nov 23, 2016](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/issues/2666#issue-191291944)

Hello,

by default the .TelegramDesktop directory has 755:

```
drwxr-xr-x  4 ago  ago      4096 nov 23 14:30 .TelegramDesktop

```

I think would be great set it to 700 or 770.

While the main homedir has 755 (and it happens by default here), a local user can obtain the contents of .TelegramDesktop.

I did not investigate what a local user which obtain those files can eventually steal.

Thanks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
