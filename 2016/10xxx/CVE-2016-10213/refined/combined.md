---

Back in February we were contacted by [Hanno Böck](https://hboeck.de/) who had discovered an issue with how certain devices generate the nonce for AES-GCM and subsequently published a [paper on the topic](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475.pdf "Nonce-Disrespecting Adversaries: Practical Forgery Attacks on GCM in TLS") and the bug was assigned [CVE-2016-0270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0270 "CVE-2016-0270 @ MITRE").

Even though in our case the bug had low severity, we tracked down the source and corrected the bug in version 2.7.2-P8 of the software.

In summary Hanno defines three categories of how nonces are generated:

* sequentially
* duplicates
* random

The first group is the correct way to generate the nonce. This ensures that a particular nonce will repeat after 2^64 records and calculated the probability of that many operations within a single session, thus proving this is secure.

The second group is a disaster. Repeating nonces if is sufficient to recover the the authentication key thus this implementation would reveal a critical vulnerability.

The third option hedges the probability of repeating a nonce randomly. With a good random number generator (RNG) the probability of collision is fairly low unless the session is used to transfer large amount of data, since after 2^32 records the probability rapidly increases. In other words there is a vague theoretical probability this can be broken if an attacker was to have the time and the victim produce exuberant amounts of data in the same session. In the paper Hanno is estimating something on the order of Terabytes in a session which for the use of [load balancers](/solutions/multi-cloud/load-balancing/) is not an issue. It does become a potential issue in long lived VPN connections though.

The A10 devices before we corrected the problem did fit in the “random” category. As of versions 2.7.2-p8, this issue has been resolved.

Despite the low probability for exploitation we would like to thank Hanno for disclosing this highly complex vulnerability, and even further to point out that he followed responsible disclosure practices and worked with us while we were investigating the origin of the vulnerability.

# Nonce-Disrespecting Adversaries

We provide supplemental material to our research on AES-GCM nonce reuse vulnerabilities in TLS.

# Research paper

* [Nonce-Disrespecting Adversaries: Practical Forgery Attacks on GCM in TLS (camera-ready version / Usenix WOOT16)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot16/woot16-paper-bock.pdf)
* [Nonce-Disrespecting Adversaries: Practical Forgery Attacks on GCM in TLS (preprint version / IACR ePrint)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475)

# Online check

* [Online check for GCM nonces](https://gcm.tlsfun.de/)

# Background

**Abstract**:

```
We investigate nonce reuse issues with the GCM block cipher mode as
used in TLS and focus in particular on AES-GCM, the most widely
deployed variant. With an Internet-wide scan we identified 184 HTTPS
servers repeating nonces, which fully breaks the authenticity of the
connections. Affected servers include large corporations, financial
institutions, and a credit card company. We present a proof of
concept of our attack allowing to violate the authenticity of affected
HTTPS connections which in turn can be utilized to inject seemingly
valid content into encrypted sessions. Furthermore, we discovered
over 70,000 HTTPS servers using random nonces, which puts them at risk
of nonce reuse, in the unlikely case that large amounts of data are
sent via the same session.

```
