Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-10121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure default permissions of the `/dev/shm/firejail` directory within the Firejail sandbox environment. Prior to commit `1cab02f5ae3c90c01fae4d1c16381820b757a3a6`, this directory was created with mode `0777`, meaning any user inside the sandbox could read, write, and execute files within it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive (`0777`) permissions assigned to `/dev/shm/firejail`.
- **Shared Memory Abuse:** Because `/dev/shm` is for shared memory, with `0777` any user in the sandbox can write to memory that is shared with other processes within the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the ability to write to shared memory with `0777` within the Firejail sandbox can potentially be used to elevate privileges to root through a multitude of techniques. For example, writing to the shared memory of a root process or creating a setuid program within the directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any user who can execute a program within a Firejail sandbox created with insecure perms on `/dev/shm/firejail`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to execute programs within a vulnerable Firejail sandbox (i.e. it was created without correct permission settings for `/dev/shm/firejail`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the permissions of `/dev/shm/firejail` so that is not world-writeable, preventing unprivileged users from writing to the directory.
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in commit `1cab02f5ae3c90c01fae4d1c16381820b757a3a6`.
