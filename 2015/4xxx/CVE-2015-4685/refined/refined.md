```
{
  "CVE-2015-4685": {
    "Root cause": "The 'plcm' user was granted excessive sudo privileges, allowing it to execute certain tools and scripts with root privileges. Some of these scripts and folders were writeable by the 'plcm' user.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Sudo misconfiguration",
      "Insecure file permissions"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges, leading to full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit the sudo misconfiguration. An attacker with 'plcm' user access can write malicious scripts to folders where they have write access, and execute them with root privileges through sudo.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have user-level access as the 'plcm' user on the system. This can be achieved through other vulnerabilities present in the same software."
