I've just added an advisory with embedded PoC code.
This is the first of several vulnerabilities to report. Should I create new tickets for the additional ones?

PS. I requested a 90 day embargo from Daniel on twitter and he said that shouldn't be a problem. How do y'all feel about scheduling public release for ~ July 8th?
The main reason for this request is to give the Android Security Team (also affected by these issues) some time to work within their normal back-channels (OHA, etc).

Why July 8?
We ship Firefox releases on June 30 and August 11. Normally, assuming we're fixing something, we'd want dates to line up with a release.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Because it's 90 days from today. I'm fine with June 30 but August 11 is too late. I mainly wanted to give the Android guys a solid 90 days to do their magic.

Our philosophy is that the reporter is in control so whatever you set we'll have to live with. 90 days is reasonable but it's a little stressful having the countdown clock running with no vulnerability information to work with.Flags: needinfo?(mozilla-bugs)

On mac I'm seeing this message from a debug build:

I don't know if that's reporting an expected error from this intentionally corrupt video, or if that's something preventing us from getting to the reported bug.

Remove this vulnerability, and 5 others that could be similarly exploited. With [bug 1158568](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158568 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright might lead to heap overflow"), we ensure that an atom size never exceeds UINT32\_MAX, we use that fact so we don't have to specifically test for overflow.

Jean-Yves: Your changes look good although there are quite a few spurious ones (not security related). I'm unable to see [bug 1158568](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158568 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright might lead to heap overflow") so I cannot comment on that. I still have backlog of issues to report. I'll do my best to get that done before Wednesday.
PS. have these changes been pushed to any public repository yet?

not this one...
We never push to the public repository until changes are peer-reviewed.
I've added you as CC on 1158568 so you'll be able to see it.
Note that we are going to get rid of libstagefright "soon" ((c) wishful thinking), and we now only use it to read the MP4 metadata.Flags: needinfo?(jyavenard)

I see there was a change for [bug 1154683](/show_bug.cgi?id=1154683 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright (data tag in mp4) might lead to heap overflow") pushed publicly though. That was one of the other issues I discovered but haven't yet reported :-/

The sooner the better. That code was written without any regard for security or stability. I'd argue it's actually dangerous even with all of the fixes I've been putting in in the last month.

You don't need to convince me there... However, for our now limited use of it and its scope, it's okay.

I'm not sure what you mean. All of the RCE vulns I've found thus far are in the MetdataExtractor related issues. This are the most dangerous as they happen before anything else and thus can be exploited silently. There's no user interaction required beyond getting the media processed somehow. It just so happens in Firefox that happens only when assigning the media file to a video element.

(trying again, broken english)
I'm not sure what you mean. All of the RCE vulns I've found thus far are MetdataExtractor related issues. These are the most dangerous. Metadata extraction happens before anything else and thus can be exploited silently. There's no user interaction required beyond getting the media processed. AFAIK, in Firefox, that happens only when assigning the media file to a video element.

Avoid potential integers overflow
Copying from [bug 1154683](/show_bug.cgi?id=1154683 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright (data tag in mp4) might lead to heap overflow"), as it's similar just different MP4 atoms
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? You'll need to craft an MP4 file with bogus atom's size offset. If you set the offset to be INT32\_MAX - [1-8] ; you could end up allocating only [1-8] bytes and write in this allocated buffer INT32\_MAX bytes.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? no. Only mentions that we prevent an overflow from happening (and reject the entire mp4 as being invalid)
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? anything including libstagefright. The flow was in this 3rd party library/
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? [bug 908503](/show_bug.cgi?id=908503 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update demuxer in MP4Reader to be usable for <video>")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? The patch should apply on all branches with stagefright
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Little, we just ensure that no integer overflow can occur.
As a note, all android devices ship with stagefright of which we have no control. They will have that flaw too. Firefox on Android makes use of the system's stagefright. Hopefully google will fix it.

Google already accepted the 7 patches I sent them. Those patches contain over 100 changes. However, [bug 1154683](/show_bug.cgi?id=1154683 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright (data tag in mp4) might lead to heap overflow") (which I still cannot access) was not yet reported to them. Was [bug 1154683](/show_bug.cgi?id=1154683 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright (data tag in mp4) might lead to heap overflow") externally reported? If so that is a very troubling development. Especially for Android security.
I am back to focus with reporting that and other problems to all affected parties. Hang on to your britches.

Yes, this is correct. sec-high and sec-critical bugs that affect more than trunk need sec-approval+ before landing.
sec-approval is kind of formality at this point, as disclosure has occurred, though it is still good to let somebody make sure flags and set or whatever.

BTW, my testing shows that Android does \*NOT\* use Android's system stagefright. The crash backtrace shows it's using the code within Mozilla itself. Did I make some mistake?

I wasn't referring to Firefox for Android..
Running a new try: that itself makes it public too (sorry I wasn't aware of the process).
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=594c1f8183f1>
Not sure why the static analyser chokes on (size\_t)-1. This is a very common trick to determine the maximum value of size\_t (which isn't always UINT32\_T and can be less: I know of one system where it's 24 bits, though likely never going to run firefox :) )

Considering that warning fatal is totally idiotic.
Of course it's going to always be false on 64 bits systems as it would never overflow there. That's the whole point of testing for overflow !Flags: needinfo?(jyavenard)

Avoid potential integers overflow
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=b8d18fdd65f8>
I can't foresee issues now.
The artificial size limitation (though extremely reasonable) is only to bypass our build system's own limitation that doesn't want a test to always be false (as intended)

I'm confused. Doesn't sec-approval+ mean you're going to violate the embargo even worse than it already is?

Sec-approval+ means that the fix can be checked in. That doesn't violate any embargoes. Those are about disclosure, not fixing the bug.

Okay. I guess that is a bit of a grey area since checking things in to a public repository constitutes a form of public disclosure. It's well known in security researcher circles that various parties monitor the code repositories for security fixes for their own purposes -- both offensive and defensive focused organizations.
If it weren't for the severity of these issues and the complications with cross-disclosure I'd be inclined to publish my own advisories once fixes hit the public tree. Alas, it shouldn't be long until everything is public anyway but I wouldn't be surprised to see additional external reports or even malicious actors becoming more active around these and related issues in the meantime. It's a shame that the process doesn't protect this type of information better.

1) It isn't a gray area.
20 We don't have a non-public repository.
If you want Mozilla to fix a bug, we have to check it in.

Yes, we know this. This is why we have sec-approval as a flag. I and one other person (Dan Veditz) approve checkins for any critical or high rated security bugs that affect more than trunk during our six week dev cycle taking the fact that our repositories are watched into account. See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> for more information.

If you did this you'd burn any good will and we'd be unlikely to work with you in a friendly manner in the future. That is not an appropriate response to a checkin to fix an issue by us and would damage your relationship to us. We are well aware of the risks of checkin. We fixing it in our trunk, which is Firefox 40, and we'll also be taking it in 39 and 38 (Aurora and Beta) \*specifically\* because it is a sec-critical bug that we've just checked a fix in for.

I'd also point out that people that zero day Firefox users are not people that we have participate in our bounty program. Publishing an advisory before we ship a release with this fix is a zero day disclosure against us.

Al,
Your points are well placed and understood. Perhaps in the future the situation can improve. I will adjust my coordination efforts with Mozilla accordingly. Maybe it makes more sense to notify Mozilla later in the process so that they can ship faster and expose other (non-Firefox users) less.
This is no small number of users btw. These issues affect 95% of Android devices today, which amounts to around 950 million devices. It's critically exploitable on those systems via MMS. I hope you can understand my point of view.

This bug was disclosed to us on March 31. We're likely fixing this in our Firefox release on May 12. That's six weeks. I'm not sure how much faster you would expect this to be fixed than six weeks from report when we have (coincidentally this time) a six week release cycle.

In fact, we didn't get the PoC until April 9. How fast, exactly, do you expect Firefox to ship a fix if five weeks from full disclosure to us is not acceptable? Aren't you the one asking for an embargo until July 8?

I'm not sure where the confusion came in, but let me attempt to clarify.
I'm not arguing that you need to deliver a fix faster. You guys do great there and it's well known that's the case.
My issue about properly honoring the embargo. You guys have effectively 0day'd all Android users by pushing a fix publicly ahead of the embargo. I understand you care about Firefox users first and foremost, but they are not the only people at risk and don't even come close to being the majority.
So my proposal is that in order to keep things embargoed by Mozilla (not pushed to a public repository) people should notify Mozilla around 6 weeks prior to the embargo date instead of 90 days ahead.

I think you misunderstand what "embargo" means at Mozilla. It doesn't mean we don't fix the bug in our repositories. It means we don't disclose the fix and write an advisory discussing it until the embargo date, giving other parties time to do the same. Neither we nor anyone else is coordinating the day that fixes are checked into a repository. We coordinate when we \*talk\* in \*public\* about such fixes.
If you notify Mozilla six weeks ahead of when you think code should be checked in, I'm afraid there is no guarantee that any code will be checked in on your specified date. Our developers work on code at best possible speed balancing the calls on their time, their expertise, and the difficulties of fixes.
If you wanted no \*checkin\* until a specific date, you needed to be clear about that up front.
In any case, the code is checked in now and the only violation of our standard procedure was that the dev did not get sec-approval+ before checkin. We don't consider fixing a bug in a repository a public disclosure for the purposes of coordination.

The Android guys actually can guarantee an embargo date. They have a private repository from which they do not push fixes until when they release. That said, it's unlikely that they'll make the July 8th date anyway. We're likely just splitting hairs about how early Android get's 0day'd at this point :-/
I understand the complexities of balancing developing against security. While I don't necessarily agree with Mozilla's policies, I do understand them. In fact I understand them better than before, thanks to this discussion. Thank you for clarifying these details. I'll be sure to request \*no-checkin-until\* on future reports. Sorry for the misunderstanding :-/

I personally think that you're over estimating the exploitability of this bug (other than crashing that is).
Let's also keep in mind that we've been fixing vulnerabilities in stagefright ever since we included in our source tree (over 2 years ago) The code isn't big, that it contains such a high ratio of bugs per line count is a remarkable achievement in itself.
What I mean to say by this, is that the people you claim would monitor for new exploits would likely have noticed already. Of course this is my personal opinion...
(Should I state my opinion of android? :) )
Now, this isn't about lessening the impact of my foolishness about what sec-approval meant. It's the second times I've pushed this week without such approval. I should have asked first on what to do rather than assume things. For that I apologise (though I will accept that this doesn't make much of a difference)

Thanks. I'm being genuine here and not \*trying\* to be antagonistic if it seems like I am. We clearly had a misunderstanding about the meaning of terminology.
Please be aware of our (normally) six week cycle for releases when discussing dates: <https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar>
We check all security fixes into trunk (nightly) first and then check them into Aurora and Beta branches if they are high or critical rated issues and there is time to do so without destabilizing those branches for a release. For example, you're unlikely to be see too many fixes in the last two weeks before a release into the Beta branch (which is the next release always) because we could jeopardize the release's stability. We have a window of about three weeks in each cycle where most fixes can go in. We also have to take our Extended Support Release (ESR) branch or branches (during the overlap between two ESR branches) into account as well if the issues affects ESR.
So, there is a lot of coordination to do. We try to get any high or critical rated issues fixed as soon as possible though.

Exploitability is secondary to getting things fixed in my opinion. Assuming that memory corruption can only result in a crash is a mistake that many have made in the past. Let's not repeat their folly.
I've personally examined the resulting crash and various other relevant parameters, both in Firefox and Android and believe this issue to be exploitable. I will invest more research time in this area soon and prove it to myself (and others) one way or the other.

I agree that the number of bugs per line count is a remarkable achievement. However, rather than laugh about it I'm attempting to fix these issues.

That's a fair point. They likely have taken notice, which is perhaps the main reason I am working to get these fixed.
> (Should I state my opinion of android? :) )
Despite what you think about Android, it has grown to become the most widely deployed operating system globally. In fact, isn't B2G based heavily on Android? I think that deserves some respect and increased attention on securing the platform. I'm happy to spend my time trying to improve it at least.

Thanks for apologizing. It takes a strong person to admit their mistakes and apologize. You've gained my respect for that, for whatever that is worth.

Not at all Al. I've not worked with Mozilla in this capacity before, certainly not on coordinating issues as complex is this. This is very much a learning process for me. I genuinely appreciate your elaborations and clarifications.

Hey all. I've revisited my remaining fixes and found that Jean-Yves seems to have fixed all of the critical issues with his changes made between this and [bug 1158568](/show_bug.cgi?id=1158568 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in libstagefright might lead to heap overflow"). I still have a significant number of lesser severity or non-security related changes that I've submitted upstream (and were accepted). If Mozilla is interested in carrying these changes forward as well please say so and I will build a patch including all of those changes on a new ticket.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
