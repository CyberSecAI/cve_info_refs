  "CVE-2015-4216": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the remote support functionality of Cisco WSAv, Cisco ESAv, and Cisco SMAv Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to the affected system with the privileges of the *root* user.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to the presence of a default authorized SSH key that is shared across all the installations of WSAv, ESAv, and SMAv. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH private key and using it to connect to any WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the *root* user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default authorized SSH key that is shared across all the installations of WSAv, ESAv, and SMAv.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of hard-coded credentials",
       "Inadequate access controls"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to connect to the affected system with the privileges of the *root* user.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to obtain the private SSH key, and use it to connect to a vulnerable system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to gain access to the default authorized SSH private key."
