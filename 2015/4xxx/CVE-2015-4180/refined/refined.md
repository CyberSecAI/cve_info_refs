Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous arbitrary file download vulnerability (CVE-2009-4050) in phpMyBackupPro.
*   The fix in version 2.2 introduced a file extension whitelist which was insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows attackers to download specific configuration files by using a path traversal technique with `../` sequences in the request, specifically targeting files with a `.php` extension (e.g., `../../files/filename.php`).
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix only addressed arbitrary file downloads, but it did not properly restrict access to specific configuration files through path traversal.
*   **Filename suffix blacklist** was added in 2.5 which was incomplete as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Configuration File Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially download sensitive configuration files, which may contain credentials, database connection details, or other critical information. This could lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests with path traversal sequences targeting configuration files using a `../../files/filename.php` format.
*   **Web Interface:** This vulnerability is present in the phpMyBackupPro web interface and can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting phpMyBackupPro.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know (or be able to guess) the location and names of the configuration files they wish to download.

**Versions Affected:**

*   The content suggests the vulnerability affects at least versions 2.1 through 2.4 of phpMyBackupPro.

**Relationship to Other CVEs:**
*   CVE-2015-4180 is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-4050. CVE-2015-4181 is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-4180.
