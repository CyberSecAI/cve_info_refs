- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of HTTPTransformation requests in WebSEAL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of HTTPTransformation requests can lead to unauthorized access to files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could potentially gain access to readable and writable files on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTPTransformation requests to the WebSEAL component. The attack has a high attack complexity and requires user interaction.
