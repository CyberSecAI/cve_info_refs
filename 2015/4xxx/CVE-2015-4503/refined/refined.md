      "root_cause": "The TCP Socket API implementation in Mozilla Firefox mishandles array boundaries when using `navigator.mozTCPSocket.open` and `send` method calls.",

        "Improper bounds checking in the TCP Socket API implementation.",

        "A malicious or compromised remote TCP server.",

      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or have access to a remote TCP server that a vulnerable client connects to.  The client must have the `mozTCPSocket` API enabled (enabled by default in Firefox OS, disabled by default on other operating systems).  The attacker also needs to be able to persuade an application to use this API to send data.  The attacker may need to send multiple socket messages to leak enough client memory."
