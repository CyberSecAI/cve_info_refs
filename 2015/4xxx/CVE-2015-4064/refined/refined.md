```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress Landing Pages plugin version 1.8.4 is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsanitized input in the `$_GET['post']` parameter in the `modules/module.ab-testing.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `wp-admin/post.php` endpoint, specifically when deleting a variation with the `ab-action=delete-variation` parameter, while also controlling the `post` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the capability to edit posts.
