  "CVE-2015-4483": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass a mixed-content protection mechanism via a feed: URL in a POST request.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles feed: URLs within POST requests. The mixed content blocker does not correctly parse or identify the security context when a POST request is made to a 'feed:' URL which contains an insecure resource which leads to the bypass of mixed content protection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypassed mixed content protection",
      "Address bar spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass the mixed content protection and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can entice a user to interact with a specially crafted URL which uses the feed: protocol with a POST request which includes an insecure resource.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the capability to entice a victim into submitting the malicious request. The attacker would also need the ability to man-in-the-middle the network connection between the victim and the target site."

    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in `mar_read.c` within the Firefox Updater when handling a crafted MAR file name.",
