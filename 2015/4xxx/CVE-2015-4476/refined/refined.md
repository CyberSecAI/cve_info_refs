  "CVE-2015-4476": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CVE ID": "CVE-2015-4476",
      "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 on Android allows user-assisted remote attackers to spoof address-bar attributes by leveraging lack of navigation after a paste of a URL with a nonstandard scheme, as demonstrated by spoofing an SSL attribute."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Firefox for Android does not properly handle URLs with custom schemes pasted into the address bar. Instead of attempting to navigate, it updates the address bar but fails to load a page, which allows an attacker to manipulate the URL and potentially any security indicators.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Address bar spoofing"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can trick users into believing they are on a legitimate site by displaying a spoofed URL in the address bar. The user may be more likely to enter sensitive information or perform other actions that could compromise their security.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The user is on a malicious site, that provides a crafted link",
		 "The user copies the crafted link and pastes it into Firefox's address bar",
        "The crafted link uses a non-standard URL scheme (e.g., secure://)",
		"The malicious site instructs the user to copy/paste this crafted link"
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to copy and paste a crafted URL from a malicious website to exploit the spoofing vulnerability. The user must then attempt to load that crafted URL.",
	  "Additional Details": "This vulnerability is specific to Firefox on Android and does not affect Firefox on OS X, Linux, or Windows. The fix involves loading an error page when an unrecognized URL scheme is entered or pasted. The vulnerability also does not affect Paste & Go feature."
