Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-4668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an open redirect in the `openwin.php` script. The script takes a `redirurl` parameter from the GET request and uses it in the `Location` header without proper validation. This allows an attacker to control the redirection target.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The `openwin.php` script directly uses the user-supplied `redirurl` parameter in the `Location` header, enabling a malicious redirect.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The script lacks any validation or sanitization of the `redirurl` parameter, allowing any arbitrary URL to be used as the redirect target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can create seemingly legitimate links to the Xsuite host, tricking users into clicking on them and redirecting them to a malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks to steal credentials or infect user systems with malware.
- **Malware Distribution:** Users could be redirected to websites hosting malware, leading to system compromise.
- **Reputational Damage:** The organization using the vulnerable software could suffer reputational damage if users are redirected to malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** An attacker crafts a URL to the Xsuite host that includes the `redirurl` parameter with a malicious target, then sends this link to a target user via email, chat, or other means.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on social engineering to get the user to click on the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Xsuite server and to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to click the malicious link.
