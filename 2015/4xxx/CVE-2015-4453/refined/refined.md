Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4453:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in OpenEMR's implementation of a "fake register_globals" mechanism within the `interface/globals.php` file. This mechanism is intended to simulate the behavior of the deprecated `register_globals` PHP setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is that an attacker can bypass the authentication process by sending the `ignoreAuth=1` parameter via a GET or POST request. This parameter is not properly handled by the vulnerable code, allowing unauthenticated access to certain parts of the application.
*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287)**: The vulnerability is categorized as an Improper Authentication issue, specifically due to the failure to properly validate user identity before granting access to protected resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** A remote attacker, without requiring valid credentials, can access sensitive information if the affected application components do not disable the flawed `fake register_globals` functionality, do not rely on session data established during the login process, and are not protected by access control lists.
*   **Chaining with SQL Injection (CVE-2014-5462):** The vulnerability can be combined with pre-existing SQL injection vulnerabilities found in areas such as `interface/fax/fax_dispatch_newpid.php` and `interface/billing/sl_eob_search.php` to further compromise the application and potentially the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface.
*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack is executed by sending a crafted HTTP GET or POST request with the `ignoreAuth=1` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable OpenEMR instance to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** No user credentials are needed to exploit this vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**

*   OpenEMR versions 2.8.3 to 4.2.0 patch 1 are vulnerable.

**Solution:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in OpenEMR 4.2.0 patch 2. Users should update to this version or later.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Brian D. Hysell and coordinated by JPCERT/CC.
*   The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 5.0, indicating a medium severity.
