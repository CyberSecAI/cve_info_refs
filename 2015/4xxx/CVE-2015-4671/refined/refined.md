Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the OpenCart e-commerce platform. Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation for the `zone_id` parameter, which is sent via a POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  The `zone_id` parameter within the `/opencart/index.php?route=account/address/add` URL is vulnerable. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into this parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, particularly the `zone_id`. The code initially checks if  `$this->request->post['zone_id']` exists, but then uses it directly, without sanitizing, in the application.
- **Incorrect Fix:** The initial patch attempt uses `is_int()` to validate `$this->request->post['zone_id']`, which will always return false as the value is a string. The correct check should be against a numeric type (`is_numeric()`) or by casting to an integer using `intval()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can exploit this XSS vulnerability to hijack a logged-in user's session.
- **Account Takeover:** By hijacking a session, an attacker can change the user's password, effectively locking the victim out of their account while maintaining access.
- **Admin Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator's session is hijacked, the attacker gains full administrative privileges, potentially leading to complete control of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to `/opencart/index.php?route=account/address/add` with a malicious script embedded within the `zone_id` parameter.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** A victim needs to be logged in to be targeted. The attacker might trick a logged in user to visit the malicious link or trigger the exploit via other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenCart instance.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP POST requests.
- **No prior authentication required** in order to send the malicious payload to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenCart versions 2.1.0.1 and possibly earlier versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ziyahan Albeniz during testing with Netsparker Web Application Security Scanner.
- A patch for this vulnerability was released, but the initial patch used `is_int()`, which is an incorrect way to validate the data type of `zone_id`, resulting in another commit to correct it.
- The advisory timeline shows that the vendor was contacted on 07/12/2015, a fix was released on 16/12/2015 and the advisory was released on 18/12/2015.
