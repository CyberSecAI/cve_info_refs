Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in the Oracle E-Business Suite. The application improperly processes external entities in XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection (CWE-611):** The core vulnerability is that the application is susceptible to XXE injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate XML parsing to include malicious external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the following impacts:
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by crafting a malicious XML request with a crafted DTD.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can cause a denial of service condition, for example, via XML entity expansion.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker might be able to use the server to make requests to other systems or internal services.
*   **NTLM Relay:** The vulnerability can be leveraged to conduct NTLM relay attacks, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   The attacker sends a crafted XML request to the vulnerable servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite server.
*   The attacker does not need authentication.
*   The attacker must be able to craft malicious XML requests containing the XXE payload.

**Vulnerable Component:**
*   The vulnerable servlet is identified as `/OA_HTML/IspPunchInServlet` in Oracle E-Business Suite.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Oracle E-Business Suite 12.1.3 is confirmed to be vulnerable.
*   Other versions may also be affected, but this has not been verified.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vendor released a patch in the Oracle CPU October 2015.
