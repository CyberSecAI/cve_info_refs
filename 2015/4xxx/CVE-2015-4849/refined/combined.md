Date published: 21.10.2015
Vendors contacted: Oracle

2. VULNERABILITY INFORMATION

Class: XML External Entity [CWE-611]
Impact: information disclosure, DoS, SSRF, NTLM relay
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2015-4849
CVSS Information
CVSS Base Score:  6.8 / 10

C : Impact to Confidentiality Partial (P)
I : Impact to Integrity Partial (P)

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

1) An attacker can read an arbitrary file on a server by sending a
correct XML request with a crafted DTD and reading the response from
the service.

the attacker, then relays the credentials to the target. The attacker
forwards the authentication information both ways and gets access.
