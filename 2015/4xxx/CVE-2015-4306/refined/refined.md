Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-4306:

**Vulnerability:** Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** Improper implementation of authorization and access controls in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate access controls, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Session ID Exposure:** The system improperly handles session identifiers, allowing an attacker to access and use them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to information about users logged into the system, including their session IDs.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using stolen session IDs, an attacker can impersonate any user, including administrative users, gaining their privileges.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can perform any privileged function during the validity of the stolen session ID.
*   **Cross-Tenant Access:** In multi-tenant environments, an attacker could potentially impersonate users from other tenants/domains.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed remotely.
*   **Crafted URLs:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending specially crafted URLs to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user on the system prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided CVSS vector is `AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack requires very little effort or specialized skills.
    *   **Au:S (Single):** The attacker needs to be authenticated with a single set of credentials.
    *   **C:C (Complete):** Complete compromise of confidentiality
    *  **I:C (Complete):** Complete compromise of integrity
    *  **A:C (Complete):** Complete compromise of availability
*   The vulnerability is assigned a base CVSS score of 9.0, indicating a critical severity.
*  The temporal score is 7.4, indicating that the vulnerability is still considered serious.
