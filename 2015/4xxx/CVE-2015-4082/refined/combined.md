Subject: Re: CVE request for attic : encrypted backups attack

As far as we can tell, this means that the client determines whether
to send encrypted or unencrypted data by asking the server about the
value of the "manifest type byte" stored on the server.

The reported security problem is that the client user is not asked to
confirm that unencrypted data is acceptable. There are two cases
(either the repository has never been used, or the repository has
previously been used for encrypted data), but these are conceptually
the same. Use CVE-2015-4082.

A separate question is whether there is any remaining vulnerability.
The documentation says:

> <https://github.com/jborg/attic/blob/master/docs/faq.rst>
>
> When backing up to remote servers, is data encrypted before leaving
> the local machine, or do I have to trust that the remote server isn't
> malicious?
>
> Yes, everything is encrypted before leaving the local machine.

We also know that use of remote servers for unencrypted data is
intentional functionality, as long as the client user has previously
agreed to send unencrypted data to that server.

It seems that for this advertised functionality, normally, a client's
decision on whether to encrypt would be specified in the client's
configuration, on the client's command line, or in a client-side user
interface. Asking the server seems to be an unusual design decision.
(Conceivably, it is unusual enough to have its own CVE, but we are
not sure about that.) A potentially problematic case would be a user
who uses attic from many client machines, communicating with many
servers, and intentionally chooses to encrypt in some cases but not
all. The user goes to one client machine and types:

  ATTIC_PASSPHRASE="My secret passphrase" attic create storage::second my\ data

but has forgotten that the applicable server has always been set up
for unencrypted use. Maybe a safer alternative would be for a client
to always send encrypted data unless:

  A. an option such as --cleartext is on the command line

  or

  B. the client configuration specifies cleartext and the attic
     process does not have access to a passphrase

# Frequently asked questions

Which platforms are supported?
Currently Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X are supported.
Can I backup VM disk images?
Yes, the [:ref:`deduplication <deduplication\_def>`](#id1) technique used by [|project\_name|](#id5)
makes sure only the modified parts of the file are stored.
Which file attributes are preserved?

The following attributes are preserved:

* Name
* Contents
* Time of last modification (nanosecond precision with Python >= 3.3)
* User ID of owner
* Group ID of owner
* Unix Permission
* Extended attributes (xattrs)
* Access Control Lists ([ACL\_](#id7)) on Linux, OS X and FreeBSD
* BSD flags on OS X and FreeBSD

How can I specify the encryption passphrase programmatically?
The encryption passphrase can be specified programmatically using the
ATTIC\_PASSPHRASE environment variable. This is convenient when setting up
automated encrypted backups. Another option is to use
key file based encryption with a blank passphrase. See
[:ref:`encrypted\_repos`](#id3) for more details.
When backing up to remote servers, is data encrypted before leaving the local machine, or do I have to trust that the remote server isn't malicious?
Yes, everything is encrypted before leaving the local machine.
If a backup stops mid-way, does the already-backed-up data stay there? I.e. does Attic resume backups?
Yes, during a backup a special checkpoint archive named `<archive-name>.checkpoint` is saved every 5 minutes
containing all the data backed-up until that point. This means that at most 5 minutes worth of data needs to be
retransmitted if a backup needs to be restarted.

assume attacker has access to your (still) encrypted repository and changes the manifest type byte to "unencrypted / without key file".

your next automated backup will then run in unencrypted mode without you noticing it and you give all your data to the attacker who controls your backup device.
