## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly

validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](/security/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](/security/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the

Linux kernel's USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not

properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](/security/CVE-2016-3140))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel's USB driver for IMS Passenger

Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device's interfaces. An

attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](/security/CVE-2016-3689))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3003-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

10 June 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-38.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-38.45)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Determining the right number of CVE IDs is typically not based on
looking at the number of impacts. We have reorganized your request to
account for that.

In this case, the primary problem was using the wrong integer data
type. No code needed to be added; the only change was from signed to
unsigned. Use CVE-2015-4001.

In these two cases, the primary problem was lack of a check for
whether a length value (elt->length or len) was too small. (A
secondary factor is that the data types needed to be changed to
implement this check.) The nature of the later code results in two
different types of impacts, but the two issues can still share the
same CVE ID. Use CVE-2015-4002.

The "actual length ... is never actually consulted" issues are
essentially what is described on the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html> page. Use CVE-2015-4004
for all of these CWE-130 issues. An issue can, of course, have an
out-of-bounds read impact but not be a CWE-130 issue.

If the maintainers (or any researcher) decide to disclose a
security-relevant out-of-bounds read issue that is outside the defined
scope of CVE-2015-4004, then they're certainly welcome to ask for
their own CVE ID.

There are numerous securityvulnerabilities in the handling of these packets. Two of them result ina memcpy(kernel_buffer, network_packet, -length), one of them is adivide-by-zero, and one of them is a loop that decrements -1 until it'szero.I've written a very simple proof-of-concept for each one of thesevulnerabilities to aid with detecting and fixing them. The generaloperation of each proof-of-concept code is:  - Load the module with:    # insmod ozwpan.ko g_net_dev=eth0  - Compile the PoC with ozprotocol.h from the kernel tree:    $ cp /path/to/linux/drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozprotocol.h ./    $ gcc ./poc.c -o ./poc  - Run the PoC:    # ./poc eth0 [mac-address]These PoCs should also be useful to the maintainers for testing outconstructing and sending various other types of malformed packets againstwhich this driver should be hardened.Please assign CVEs for these vulnerabilities. I believe the first twopatches of this set can receive one CVE for both, and the remaining twocan receive one CVE each.On a slightly related note, there are several other vulnerabilities inthis driver that are worth looking into. When ozwpan receives a packet,it casts the packet into a variety of different structs, based on thevalue of type and length parameters inside the packet. When making thesecasts, and when reading bytes based on this length parameter, the actuallength of the packet in the socket buffer is never actually consulted. Assuch, it's very likely that a packet could be sent that results in thekernel reading memory in adjacent buffers, resulting in an informationleak, or from unpaged addresses, resulting in a crash. In the former case,it may be possible with certain message types to actually send theseleaked adjacent bytes back to the sender of the packet. So, I'd highlyrecommend the maintainers of this driver go branch-by-branch from theinitial rx function, adding checks to ensure all reads and casts arewithin the bounds of the socket buffer.Jason A.

# USN-3001-1: Linux kernel (Vivid HWE) vulnerabilities

10 June 2016

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid for Trusty

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux

kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-2117](/security/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap()

handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a

recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code

with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](/security/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB

over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](/security/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel's GTCO digitizer USB

device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker

with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](/security/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would

improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86

processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were

disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an

existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](/security/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error

occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](/security/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling

incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](/security/CVE-2016-3955))

Vitaly Kuznetsov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly suppress

hugetlbfs support in X86 paravirtualized guests. An attacker in the guest

OS could cause a denial of service (guest system crash). ([CVE-2016-3961](/security/CVE-2016-3961))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2

Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2016-4485](/security/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket

interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel

memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](/security/CVE-2016-4486))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel

could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged

attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on

systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded.

([CVE-2016-4565](/security/CVE-2016-4565))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle

propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](/security/CVE-2016-4581))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1031-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1031.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1031.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
