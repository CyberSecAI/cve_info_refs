{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. The driver casts the packet into different structs based on type and length parameters within the packet, without properly validating the length against the actual socket buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted network packet to the vulnerable device.",
        "The attacker can send a malformed packet which results in the kernel reading memory in adjacent buffers"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system running the vulnerable driver."
