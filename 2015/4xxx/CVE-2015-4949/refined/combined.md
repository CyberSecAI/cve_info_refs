## Error description

* ```
  *VULNERABILITY SUMMARY*

  The password associated with Tivoli Storage Manager or the
  Microsoft SQL DB user is displayed in plain text via application
  pop-up messages for failed operations and in application trace
  output.

  *VULNERABILITY DETAILS*

  Tivoli Storage Manager for Databases could allow a local user
  to see error messages that contain the plain text passwords of
  users.

  When using one of the following applications:

  - Tivoli Storage Manager for Databases: Data Protection for
   Microsoft SQL Server

  - Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Microsoft
  Exchange Server

  - Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager on Windows

  pop-up error messages associated with an exception condition
  generated during a failed backup, restore, or query operation
  will display the Tivoli Storage Manager password and/or the
  Microsoft SQL DB user's password in plain text.

  Also, when application tracing is enabled, these passwords are
  displayed in plain text in the trace output.

  In all cases, the passwords displayed are passwords that the
  logged in user executing the operation would already know or
  have access to via their login credentials.

  ```
