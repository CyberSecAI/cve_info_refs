Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the applications displaying Tivoli Storage Manager or Microsoft SQL database user passwords in plain text within application pop-up error messages and trace outputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Plaintext Password Exposure:** Passwords for Tivoli Storage Manager and Microsoft SQL DB users are exposed in plain text in error messages and trace logs.
*   **Insufficient Security Controls:** Lack of proper masking or encryption of sensitive data within the application's error handling and logging mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Local users with access to the system can potentially view sensitive credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exposed passwords could be used for unauthorized access to the affected systems or databases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Attackers need local access to the system where the affected applications are installed.
*   **Error Message Triggering:** The attacker needs to perform operations that will generate an error to trigger the display of passwords in error messages.
*   **Trace Log Access:** If application tracing is enabled, the attacker can access the trace output to find the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have user access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the attacker needs to be a local user to view the password, there is no mention of privilege escalation in order to view the passwords. The user would need the rights to view the application pop-up messages or trace output.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Tivoli Storage Manager for Databases:** Data Protection for Microsoft SQL Server (versions 5.5, 6.3, 6.4, and 7.1)
*   **Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail:** Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange Server (versions 5.5, 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, and 7.1)
*   **Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager** MMC Snapin and Base System Services (versions 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1).
*   **Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for Microsoft SQL Server** (versions 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1)
*    **Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for Microsoft Exchange Server** (versions 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1)
    
**Mitigation:**

*   Use command line interface (CLI) instead of GUI interface (pop-up messages are only displayed when using the GUI interface).
*   Use Windows authentication instead of SQL Server Authentication.
*   Use "generate" as a value for "passwordaccess" option and make sure that a valid password has been stored in the registry.
*   Do not to enable application tracing.
