Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from FreeRADIUS's insufficient Certificate Revocation List (CRL) application when validating certificates. Specifically, FreeRADIUS was only checking the revocation status of leaf certificates and not the intermediate CA certificates in the chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient CRL Checking:** The core issue is that FreeRADIUS did not verify the revocation status of intermediate CA certificates when validating a client certificate. It only checked the leaf certificate.
*   **Reliance on OpenSSL:** FreeRADIUS uses OpenSSL for certificate validation, but it did not properly utilize the `X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL` flag, which would have enabled the check for the entire certificate chain. Instead, it only set the `X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK` flag, which only checks the leaf certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Acceptance of Revoked Certificates:** An attacker could potentially use a client certificate issued by an intermediate CA whose certificate had been revoked, and FreeRADIUS would still accept it as valid if the leaf certificate itself was still valid. This could allow unauthorized access if certificate revocation was intended to block access for specific users or devices.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** If the certificate revocation mechanism was used as an access control, exploitation of this vulnerability would bypass that control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is primarily over the network where the FreeRADIUS service is accessible.
*   **EAP-TLS:** This vulnerability specifically affects setups using EAP-TLS methods where client certificates are utilized for authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Intermediate CA:** An attacker would require access to, or to have compromised an intermediate Certificate Authority (CA).
*   **Revoked Intermediate CA Certificate:** The attacker would require a valid client certificate signed by an intermediate CA, for which the intermediate CA's certificate has been revoked.
*   **Network Access to FreeRADIUS:** The attacker must be able to communicate with a vulnerable FreeRADIUS server using EAP-TLS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The FreeRADIUS project recommends using self-signed CAs for all EAP-TLS methods as a configuration alternative.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in FreeRADIUS versions 2.2.8 and 3.0.9 and later.
*   SUSE Bugzilla entry [935573](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=935573) tracks this vulnerability.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry [1234975](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1234975) tracks this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was anonymously reported.
*   The severity is rated as low by SUSE, with a CVSS v2 score of 4.0 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N), while NIST assigned a CVSS score of 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
