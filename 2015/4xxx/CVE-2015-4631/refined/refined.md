    "summary": "The provided content details multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) vulnerabilities within the Koha Integrated Library System (ILS). The root cause is improper input validation and a lack of challenge tokens to prevent XSRF attacks. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts and HTML, potentially leading to privilege escalation, session hijacking, browser exploitation, and server compromise.",

      {
        "Root cause": "Improper input validation and a lack of challenge tokens to prevent XSRF attacks.",
        "Weaknesses": "Multiple stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities and XSRF vulnerabilities.",
        "Impact": "Attackers can escalate privileges (even gaining superlibrarian permissions), target other users by stealing session tokens, impersonate users, exploit browser vulnerabilities to gain access on their machines, perform unauthorized actions with the permissions of a staff member, and exploit other server-side vulnerabilities to fully compromise the web server.",
        "Attack vectors": "Compromised user accounts (e.g., through SQL injection, brute-forcing, or sniffing) and malicious links (e.g., in phishing emails or forum links).",
        "Attacker capabilities": "Requires either a compromised user account, or social engineering to trick a user into clicking a malicious link."
