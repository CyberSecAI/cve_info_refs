Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the way Samsung SBeam handles peer-to-peer wireless connections. Specifically, after an NFC connection is initiated, a vulnerable device launches an HTTP server on port 15000.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The HTTP server launched on port 15000 allows remote attackers to download any or all images on the device without authentication or any user interaction after the initial NFC connection.
- **Lack of User Notification:** The process of downloading images happens without any notification to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can remotely access and copy images from a vulnerable Samsung SBeam device.
- **Privacy Violation:** The unauthorized access to and download of images compromises the privacy of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Proximity Attack:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the target device's NFC to initiate the vulnerable SBeam connection.
- **Network Access:** Once the NFC connection is established, the attacker gains network access to the vulnerable HTTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **NFC Transmitter:** The attacker needs a device capable of acting as a hostile NFC transmitter.
- **Proximity:** The attacker must be within NFC range of the target device.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the HTTP server once it is enabled on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during the Mobile Pwn2Own competition.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by ZDI (Zero Day Initiative) without a patch available, after their 120-day disclosure deadline.
-  The vendor stated that fixes require FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) updates from carriers and acknowledged that some devices may not have received the update making them vulnerable.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.3 with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, indicating an adjacent network attack with low complexity, no authentication, and a partial confidentiality impact.
