- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `getBackupPolicies` (or `getBackupPolicy`, both are mentioned in different documents of the same source) method of the `EdgeServiceImpl` web service in Arcserve Unified Data Protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient access control or lack of authentication. The web service method returns sensitive credential information without requiring authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive credentials, leading to information disclosure under the context of the SYSTEM user.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can send a crafted SOAP request to the vulnerable `getBackupPolicies`/`getBackupPolicy` method of the web service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Arcserve Unified Data Protection installation. No prior authentication is required.
