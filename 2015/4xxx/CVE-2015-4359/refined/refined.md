**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root causes vary depending on the specific vulnerability:

*   **Open Redirect:**  Improper sanitization of user-provided URLs, allowing redirection to malicious sites.
*   **XSS:** Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser.
*   **Access Bypass:** Flaws in access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they should not be able to.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of proper token validation, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent.
*   **SQL Injection:** Improperly sanitized user input being used in SQL queries, allowing injection of malicious SQL code.
*  **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** Unrestricted upload of files which can execute PHP.
*  **Arbitrary file deletion:** Improperly sanitized input allows deletion of files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Improper access control on sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Open Redirect:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to phishing or malware sites.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into vulnerable web pages through user input fields, comments, or other avenues.
*   **Access Bypass:** Attackers can exploit flaws in access control to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions through malicious websites or emails.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into user inputs to manipulate or extract sensitive data.
*   **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** Upload malicious PHP files.
*   **Arbitrary file deletion:** Crafted requests can delete files.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Direct access to sensitive information due to missing access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Vary depending on vulnerability
*   Typically requires the ability to craft malicious URLs, inject code, and/or trick users into interacting with malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Open Redirect:** Phishing attacks, malware distribution.
*   **XSS:** Session hijacking, defacement of websites, stealing sensitive user information.
*   **Access Bypass:** Unauthorized access to functionality or data, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **CSRF:** Unauthorized modification of user data, performing unwanted actions on behalf of a user.
*   **SQL Injection:** Data breaches, compromise of system integrity.
*   **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** Full system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary file deletion:** Deletion of sensitive files, disruption of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive data
