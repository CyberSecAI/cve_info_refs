Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin/login.php` file of the Milw0rm Clone Script v1.0. Specifically, the script uses `htmlspecialchars` and `trim` on the user-provided username (`usr`) and password (`pwd`) before using them in an SQL query, but crucially, it lacks `mysql_real_escape_string` function which is needed to prevent SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The script directly incorporates unsanitized user inputs into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to manipulation via crafted SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting specially crafted SQL statements, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel. The provided exploits demonstrate how to achieve this by using SQL injection techniques in the user and password fields.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface, specifically the `/admin/login.php` login form.
*   **User Input:** The attacker manipulates the 'usr' and 'pwd' fields of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** Attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet:
```php
<?php
$usr = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['usr']));
$pwd = htmlspecialchars(trim($_POST['pwd']));
if($usr && $pwd){
$login = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM `site_info` WHERE `adm_usr`='".$usr."' AND `adm_pwd`='".md5($pwd)."';");
$row = mysql_num_rows($login);
//----Bla Bla Bla--------
```
The exploit examples are provided as follows:
```
Exploit 1:
USER: ADMIN' OR ''='
PASS: ADMIN' OR ''='

Exploit 2:
USER: ADMIN' OR 1=1#
PASS: Anything Bro :)
```
The suggested fix involves using `mysql_real_escape_string` to sanitize the input before using it in SQL Query.
```php
$usr = htmlspecialchars(trim(mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['usr'])));
$usr = htmlspecialchars(trim(mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['pwd'])));
```
