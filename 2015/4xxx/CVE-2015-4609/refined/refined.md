The provided content relates to CVE-2015-4609.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wt_directory` extension for TYPO3 fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The extension directly uses user input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   Data breaches (reading sensitive data from the database).
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data in the database).
    *   Potential complete compromise of the database and the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the `wt_directory` extension, meaning the attack vector would be through the front-end of the website or any part of the application where user input is used in the SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application that are processed by the vulnerable extension. User authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, but may vary depending on the specific implementation and vulnerable code location.
*   The attacker needs to identify the parameters or input fields that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
