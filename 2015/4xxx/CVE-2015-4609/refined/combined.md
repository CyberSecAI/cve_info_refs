# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2015-008: SQL Injection vulnerability in extension wt\_directory (wt\_directory)

It has been discovered that the extension "wt\_directory" (wt\_directory) is susceptible to SQL Injection

**Release Date:** June 15, 2015

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:**  version 1.4.1 and below

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:P/F:P/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**CVE:** not assigned yet

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input, the extension is vulnerable to SQL-Injection.

**Solution:** An updated version 1.4.2 is available from the TYPO3 Extension Manager and at [http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/wt\_directory/1.4.2/t3x/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/wt_directory/1.4.2/t3x/ "Opens external link in new window"). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible. Please note: The extension author is no longer maintaining this extension. Therefore it is marked as obsolete and should not longer be used.

**Credits:** Credits go to Marc Bastian Heinrichs who discovered and reported the issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
