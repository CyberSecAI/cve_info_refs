Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4337:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The XCloner WordPress plugin improperly handles user-supplied input in the `excl_manual` parameter. This parameter is used to specify a file containing commands that should be excluded during the backup process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The content of the `excl_manual` parameter is not properly sanitized before being displayed, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `cloner.functions.php` file
*   Specifically lines 1129-1135 and 1205 are vulnerable

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated user of the WordPress instance with access to the XCloner plugin settings.
*   The attacker modifies the `excl_manual` parameter in the request, injecting malicious JavaScript code.
*   The vulnerable code is triggered when a backup is initiated in manual mode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with sufficient privileges to access the XCloner plugin.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate HTTP requests, either through a crafted link or by directly modifying the request with a proxy.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically in the `$excluded_cmd` variable.
*   The provided proof of concept URL demonstrates the XSS vulnerability by injecting an alert dialog using the `<script>` tag.
*   The advisory also mentions that the XSS vulnerability is triggered in the `plugins.php` file at line 403
