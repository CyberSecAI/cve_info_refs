### [Explain setup for FB](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/explain-setup-for-fb/)

Hi, I’ve made my FB dev account with a login app. I used my app ID but nothing happens.
The FB popup opens, I had to agree the login but the login doesn’t work. After that I wans’t asked to accept the popup anymore. It loaded and disappeared instantly.
I tried using the SDK that I put in the body but it didn’t change anything.
Can you please show a step by step process ?
Waiting to read you soon.

Worked beautifully for Facebook and Regular Logins over HTTP but as soon as I
switched over to HTTPS it Logins fine but won’t allow me into the Dashboard
settings. Project seems dormant and without SSL support; sadly it’s no good to
me anymore.

This spaghetti of redundant code and obsolete dependencies has inspired me to create my own plugin.
How can WP authorize such low quality aberrations?

It works as advertised and I appreciate that it’s easy to customize. I do notice that some themes have issues with this plugin. But, I really appreciate the author’s work and upkeep on this plugin while keeping it free.
