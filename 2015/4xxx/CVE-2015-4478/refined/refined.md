  "CVE-2015-4478": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2 do not impose certain ECMAScript 6 requirements on JavaScript object properties, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via the reviver parameter to the JSON.parse method.",
    "root_cause": "The implementation of Walk() in json.cpp (used when there is a reviver) uses JSObject::defineGeneric to define the property. This is not what the spec says to do, and in particular it's missing the various sanity checks that [[DefineOwnProperty]] is supposed to perform.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Redefinition of non-configurable JavaScript object properties",
      "Missing sanity checks during property definition in JSON.parse with reviver"
    ],
    "impact": "Bypass of the same-origin policy by editing non-configurable properties to arbitrary values, which could allow for a more permissive usage in some circumstances.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website that uses JSON.parse with a reviver to redefine non-configurable properties of javascript objects."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user to open a malicious website, and the vulnerability is in the parsing of JSON via the reviver parameter of JSON.parse()."
