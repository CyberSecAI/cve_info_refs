Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-4966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   IBM Maximo Asset Management and related products are installed with a default administrator account enabled. This allows for remote access to the system using default credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The core vulnerability lies in the presence of a default administrative account, making it exploitable for those who have knowledge of the default credentials.
*   **Lack of Enforcement for Password Changes:** The software doesn't enforce changing the default passwords during initial setup or upgrades, leaving systems vulnerable even after the initial installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrator Access:** A remote attacker can gain full administrative access to the system, which may lead to complete control over the application, access to sensitive data, and the ability to manipulate system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network using the default administrator credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of or able to guess the default administrator username and password.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Maximo Asset Management and various related industry solution and Control Desk products if they are built on top of the vulnerable core versions of Maximo.
*   The fix involves applying interim fixes or fix packs and then configuring the "mxe.int.allowdefaultlogin" property manually.
*   A manual workaround exists for older versions without using the fix packs by editing the ejb-jar.xml file.
*   The vulnerability is considered significant as it allows for full remote control of the system.
