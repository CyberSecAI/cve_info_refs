  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    - CVE-2015-4164: A buggy loop in Xen's `compat_iret()` function iterates the wrong way around a 32-bit index.
    - CVE-2015-4106: Qemu allows guests to write to the PCI config space of passed through PCI devices.
    - CVE-2015-4105: Device model code logs messages on invalid guest PCI MSI-X interrupt management.
    - CVE-2015-4104: Unprivileged guests were allowed direct control of MSI mask bits.
    - CVE-2015-4103: The QEMU Xen code does not properly restrict write access to the host MSI message data field.

  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - CVE-2015-4164: Incorrect loop index handling in `compat_iret()`.
    - CVE-2015-4106: Unmediated write access to PCI config space.
    - CVE-2015-4105: Excessive logging of MSI-X pass-through error messages.
    - CVE-2015-4104:  Direct control of PCI MSI mask bits by guests.
    - CVE-2015-4103: Missing restrictions on host MSI message data field writes.

  - Impact of exploitation:
    - CVE-2015-4164: Denial of service affecting the whole system.
    - CVE-2015-4106: Privilege escalation, host crash (Denial of Service), or leaked information.
    - CVE-2015-4105: Host disk fills up leading to denial of service.
    - CVE-2015-4104: Host crash and therefore a Denial of Service.
    - CVE-2015-4103: Confused host side interrupt handling, potentially losing interrupts or allowing spurious interrupt injection into other guests.

  - Attack vectors:
    - CVE-2015-4164: 32-bit PV guest kernel using `hypercall_iret` with `EFLAGS.VM` set.
    - CVE-2015-4106: HVM guests with their device model in Dom0 that have access to physical PCI devices via PCI passthrough.
    - CVE-2015-4105: HVM guests with their device model in Dom0, access to physical PCI devices, and the passed through PCI devices being MSI-X capable
    - CVE-2015-4104: HVM guests with their device model in Dom0 that have access to physical MSI-capable PCI devices via PCI passthrough.
    - CVE-2015-4103: HVM guests with their device model in Dom0 that have access to physical MSI-capable PCI devices via PCI passthrough.

  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - CVE-2015-4164: Administrator access within a 32-bit PV guest.
    - CVE-2015-4106: Administrator access within an HVM guest with direct access to a PCI device.
    - CVE-2015-4105: Administrator access within an HVM guest with direct access to a MSI-X capable PCI device
    - CVE-2015-4104: Administrator access within an HVM guest with direct access to a MSI-capable PCI device
    - CVE-2015-4103: Administrator access within an HVM guest with direct access to a MSI-capable PCI device
