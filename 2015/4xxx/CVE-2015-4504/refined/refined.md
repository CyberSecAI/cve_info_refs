Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `lut_inverse_interp16` function of the QCMS library, which is responsible for color management. Specifically, it occurs during the inversion of transfer characteristic (TRC) curves within ICC profiles. The code has a section to handle "degenerate" curves (where the curve is not monotonic), but the calculation of indices into a lookup table (`LutTable`) can result in a negative offset due to a flawed calculation of a `cell0` value, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overread:** The primary issue is a stack buffer overread caused by a negative index calculation when accessing the lookup table.
*   **Improper Handling of Degenerate TRC Curves:** The logic intended to handle degenerate curves is flawed, which introduces the possibility of negative indices.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** The overread can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the stack, as the read value is used in a later precached transformation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most direct impact is a crash due to the buffer overread, causing a denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can expose sensitive data from the stack, potentially leaking information from the process memory space.
*   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, there is a theoretical possibility of achieving arbitrary code execution due to the nature of the vulnerability and how the read values are later used, though this is not stated as a direct impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ICC Profiles:** The attack is triggered by loading an image that has a specially crafted ICC V4 profile with particular attributes which triggers the faulty code path.
*   **Web Browsers:** Specifically, this vulnerability affects Mozilla Firefox and Seamonkey, as they use the vulnerable QCMS library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by having a user load a malicious image (e.g., via a website).
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to load the malicious image.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any form of authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Bugzilla entry:**

*   The problematic code was introduced in July (date not specified) to handle "degenerate" curves.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during `qcms_profile_precache_output_transform`, which occurs when a transformation is precached.
*   The affected code calculates `a` and `b` based on `NumZeroes` and `NumPoles`, which can lead to a flawed binary search with negative bounds.
*   The specific profile that triggers the vulnerability is an ICC V4 profile with a parametric TRC curve (y=1 for all x).
*   The fix involves ensuring that binary search bounds are sane, as well as clamping l and r to sane values.
*   The fix also correctly sets the value of degenerate curves.

**Severity:**

*   SUSE rated this issue as having "moderate" severity
*   Ubuntu considered this a "moderate" security issue
*   Mozilla considered this as "moderate"

**Affected Software:**

*   Mozilla Firefox (versions prior to 41.0)
*   Seamonkey (versions prior to 2.38)

**Fix Information:**

*   The issue was fixed in Mozilla Firefox 41 and SeaMonkey 2.38.
