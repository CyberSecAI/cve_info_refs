{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by missing null byte checks for file paths in the DOM and GD extensions of PHP. Specifically, the `DOMDocument::save()`, `DOMDocument::saveHTMLFile()`, and `GD::imagepsencodefont()` functions do not handle filenames with a null byte (`\0`) character correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null byte characters in file paths.",
       "Lack of sufficient input validation for filenames."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass intended file system access restrictions and potentially access unexpected files, leading to information disclosure or potentially arbitrary code execution. The specific impact may vary depending on how the application uses the vulnerable functions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can supply a malicious filename containing a null byte character through a user-controlled input, like a URL parameter or uploaded file, which is then passed to one of the vulnerable PHP functions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the file path that is processed by the vulnerable PHP functions, which is commonly done via user-supplied input."

  "additional_details": {
    "debian_details": "The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3344-1 notes that thoger at redhat dot com discovered the vulnerability. It specifies that paths containing a NUL character were improperly handled, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate unexpected files on the server.",
    "redhat_bugzilla_details": "Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1232897 provides more technical details. It mentions that the save() and saveHTMLFile() functions in DOMDocument and the imagepsencodefont() function in the GD extension do not properly handle filenames with a NUL character, potentially leading to access of unintended files from untrusted sources.  It also points to the upstream bug report and the commit diff that fixed the vulnerability.",
    "redhat_errata_details": "The Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2015:1135 indicates that certain PHP functions do not properly handle file names containing a NULL character. It states that a remote attacker could use this flaw to make a PHP script access unexpected files and bypass intended file system access restrictions."
