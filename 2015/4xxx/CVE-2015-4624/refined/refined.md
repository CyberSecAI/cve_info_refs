```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a combination of default credentials and a weakness in the anti-CSRF token generation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection vulnerability",
    "Weak anti-CSRF token generation",
    "Use of default credentials"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve command injection on a vulnerable device. If default credentials fail, an attacker can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge to reset the password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed over HTTP by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same network as the device, or have network access to it and be able to send HTTP requests. The attacker also needs to know (or be able to brute-force) the PHPSESSID for the device, which is by default `tospovirus`."
