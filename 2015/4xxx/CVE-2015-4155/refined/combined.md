GNU Parallel 20150522 ('Nepal') has been released. It is available for
download at: <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parallel/>

No new functionality was introduced so this is a good candidate for a
stable release.

Haiku of the month:

  Many jobs to run.
  Idle cores is not your thing.
  Use GNU Parallel.
      -- Ole Tange

New in this release:

* Security: The security issue for --sshlogin + --fifo/--cat has been
fixed. Thereby all issues with
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/parallel/2015-04/msg00045.html> have
been fixed.

* Security: After further security analysis the issue fixed in
20150422 also fixed the problem for --tmux.

GNU Parallel - For people who live life in the parallel lane.

= About GNU Parallel =

GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
or more computers. A job is can be a single command or a small script
that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical
input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of
URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads from
a pipe. GNU Parallel can then split the input and pipe it into
commands in parallel.

If you use xargs and tee today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to
use as GNU Parallel is written to have the same options as xargs. If
you write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running several
jobs in parallel. GNU Parallel can even replace nested loops.

GNU Parallel makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other programs.

You can find more about GNU Parallel at: <http://www.gnu.org/s/parallel/>

You can install GNU Parallel in just 10 seconds with: (wget -O -
pi.dk/3 || curl pi.dk/3/) | bash

Watch the intro video on <http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1>

Walk through the tutorial (man parallel_tutorial). Your commandline
will love you for it.

= About GNU SQL =

GNU sql aims to give a simple, unified interface for accessing
databases through all the different databases' command line clients.
So far the focus has been on giving a common way to specify login
information (protocol, username, password, hostname, and port number),
size (database and table size), and running queries.

The database is addressed using a DBURL. If commands are left out you
will get that database's interactive shell.

When using GNU SQL for a publication please cite:

Databases Using DBURLs, ;login: The USENIX Magazine, April 2011:29-32.

= About GNU Niceload =

GNU niceload slows down a program when the computer load average (or
other system activity) is above a certain limit. When the limit is
reached the program will be suspended for some time. If the limit is a
soft limit the program will be allowed to run for short amounts of
time before being suspended again. If the limit is a hard limit the
program will only be allowed to run when the system is below the
limit.

Short Summary
- -------------
GNU Parallel can be tricked into overwriting a file owned by the user
running GNU Parallel.

Published: 2015-04-22
Remote: No
Local: Yes
Ease: No exploits available - requires precise timing

Impact
- ------
An local attacker can exploit this issue to overwrite a file with a
one byte file.

Technical Description
- ---------------------
The vulnerability lies in GNU Parallel's way of creating temporary
files while at the same time trying to remove these ASAP so if GNU
Parallel is stopped there will be no temporary files to clean up.

So far this has been done by creating a temporary file and removing it
immediately. For some task the file will be recreated and removed at a
later stage. It is this last part that makes GNU Parallel vulnerable:
If an attacker sees the temporary file being created, and then
removed, he has 15 ms to create a symlink with the same name to a file
owned by the user. And if the file is then being recreated this will
overwrite the user's file.

GNU Parallel is vulnerable when using --pipe, --tmux, --cat, --fifo,
or --compress.

The problem has been fixed for most situations, but it still exists
for: --tmux if run locally, and --cat, --fifo if run remotely using
--sshlogin. For remote situations the time window is longer than 15
ms: The attacker will be able to see the ssh command being sent on the
client, and will then be able to create the file on the server while
the ssh connection is being established.

Solutions
- ---------
Upgrading to 20150422 will fix most situations.

For the remaining situations there are the following work-arounds. Any
of these will protect against the attack:

* Let --tmpdir/$TMPDIR point to a dir that is only writable by the user
* Do not use --tmux
* Do not use --cat or --fifo when also using --sshlogin
* Do not use system shared with attackers

If an upgrade is impossible any of these work-arounds will guard
against an attack:

* Let --tmpdir/$TMPDIR point to a dir that is only writable by the user
* Do not use --tmux
* Do not use --cat or --fifo or --pipe or --compress
* Do not use system shared with attackers

Vulnerable Systems
- ------------------
Any system running GNU Parallel  20101222 <= version < 20150422 is vulnerable.
