Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4155:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how GNU Parallel creates and removes temporary files. Specifically, it creates a temporary file and immediately removes it. For certain tasks, the file is recreated and removed again later.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition:** An attacker can exploit the short time window (15ms locally, longer remotely) between the removal of the temporary file and its recreation. The attacker creates a symlink with the same name as the temporary file to a file they want to overwrite. When GNU Parallel recreates the temporary file, it overwrites the user's file pointed to by the symlink.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A local attacker can overwrite a file owned by the user running GNU Parallel with a one-byte file.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when using specific GNU Parallel options:
    - `--pipe`
    - `--tmux`
    - `--cat`
    - `--fifo`
    - `--compress`
- For `--tmux`, the vulnerability exists when run locally.
- For `--cat` and `--fifo`, the vulnerability exists when run remotely using `--sshlogin`.
- The attacker needs to observe the creation and removal of the temporary file and act quickly to create the symlink.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system running GNU Parallel.
- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to precisely time the creation of the symlink during the race condition window.
- For remote exploitation via `--sshlogin`, the attacker needs to observe the ssh command being sent on the client and create the symlink on the server before the ssh connection is fully established.

**Additional notes:**

- The issue was fixed in version 20150422 for most situations.
-  The issue remained for  `--tmux` when run locally, and `--cat`, `--fifo` when using `--sshlogin` remotely until the 20150522 release.
- Workarounds include:
    - Setting `--tmpdir/$TMPDIR` to a directory writable only by the user.
    - Avoiding the use of `--tmux`, `--cat`, `--fifo`, `--pipe`, or `--compress`.
    - Avoiding systems shared with attackers
