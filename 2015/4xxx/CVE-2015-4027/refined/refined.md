Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Acunetix WVS 10 service "AcuWVSSchedulerv10" improperly handling the `reporttemplate` parameter within the `/api/addScan` API endpoint. The service, running with SYSTEM privileges, uses this parameter to generate reports, which allowed for the injection of command-line arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into the `wvs.exe` process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges. This was achieved through the `reporttemplate` parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Acunetix WVS 10 failed to properly sanitize or validate the `reporttemplate` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious arguments, specifically utilizing the `/Run` argument of the `wvs.exe` command-line tool.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The service runs as the SYSTEM user, which means injected commands are executed with the highest level of privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker, even a guest user, could gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the vulnerable system by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges, leading to complete control over the vulnerable system, allowing for malware installation, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Accessible API:** The vulnerable API endpoint `/api/addScan` is accessible via HTTP on localhost, making it reachable by any local user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where Acunetix WVS 10 is installed. This could be a user account with very low privileges, or even a guest account.
- **Ability to Make HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable API endpoint on `localhost:8183`. This can be achieved through a script, a web browser, or other tools.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to `/api/addScan` with the `reporttemplate` parameter containing a payload like `"WVSDeveloperReport.rep /Crawl http://www.google.it /Run cmd.exe"`.
- The `wvs.exe` command-line tool has a `/Run` argument that allows the execution of arbitrary commands during the crawling process. By combining the crawl with a run command, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands with system privilege.
- The provided Python script demonstrates how to send such a malicious request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Daniele Linguaglossa.
- A patch was released by Acunetix to address the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability allows for complete system compromise.
