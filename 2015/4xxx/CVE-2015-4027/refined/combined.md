========================================================================
Acunetix WVS 10 - from guest to Sytem (Local privilege escalation)

CVE: CVE-2015-4027
Author: (me) Daniele Linguaglossa
Affected Product: Acunetix WVS 10
Exploit: Local privilege escalation
Vendor: Acunetix ltd
Remote: No
Version: 10
=========================================================================
A local privilege escalation exists in Acunetix  WVS 10, it allow
a local user (even guest) to gain same privilege as System user.

With default Acunetix installation, a service called "AcuWVSSchedulerv10"
will be installed, this service run as local system user.

AcuWVSSchedulerv10 is reponsable for scan scheduling without user interaction
it expose some API to interact via a web server usually localhost:8183.

API:

/listScan
/addScan <== vulnerable one
/deleteScan
etc...

When a user schedule a scan API "addScan" will be called as following

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /api/addScan HTTP/1.1

        "reportformat": "PDF",
        "reporttemplate": "WVSAffectedItemsReport.rep",
        "emailaddress": ""
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing i noticed was the reporttemplate, this was used to create report
when scanning ends, so it means an external file wich we can control will be then
used by System! this would be interesting enough but i never look deep into.
Instead i noticed something even worst, filename was used as argument to wvs.exe
called with system privilege!

By looking at how Acunetix handled reporttemplate argument i figured out that was
possibile to inject custom arguments within reporttemplate, now this is where
Acunetix help us :D in fact wvs was provided with an interesting argument it was
/Run as reference says:

https://www.acunetix.com/blog/docs/acunetix-wvs-cli-operation/

Run a command line command during the crawl.
Syntax: /Run [command]

Example: /Run curl http://example.com/dir1/

Wow that's really nice, so in order to execute a command we must insert a fake
Crawl followed by a Run command so reporttemplate become:

"reporttemplate": "WVSAffectedItemsReport.rep /Craw http://fakesite.it /Run cmd.exe"

it worked cmd runned as System!
==================================================================================

Now let's pwn this!

I hope this write-up was funny enough anyway i really would like to thank
Acunetix product manager N.S. for the really fast answer and bug mitigation,
right now a patch exists so hurry up download it now.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
