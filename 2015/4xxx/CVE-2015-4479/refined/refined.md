**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `media/libstagefright/system/core/libutils/VectorImpl.cpp` file, specifically in the `setCapacity` function and also within `media/libstagefright/system/core/libutils/SharedBuffer.cpp`, specifically in the `SharedBuffer::alloc` function. The overflow occurs when the attacker controls the size argument of the `alloc` function in `SharedBuffer.cpp`, and the `new_capacity` parameter in `setCapacity` in `VectorImpl.cpp`, allowing for an undersized buffer allocation.
* The issue is triggered during parsing of MPEG4 media files, specifically when a `saio` chunk is processed, leading to an integer overflow that causes an undersized buffer to be allocated, due to an incorrect calculation with `mItemSize`, and `new_capacity`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** An attacker can manipulate input values to cause the `new_capacity` variable, when multiplied by `mItemSize` inside the `SharedBuffer::alloc` function to overflow, resulting in a heap buffer overflow. There is also a vulnerability in `VectorImpl::setCapacity`, where it calculates a `new_capacity` based on a value controlled by the attacker, then calls  `SharedBuffer::alloc` using this potentially manipulated value.
*  **Out-of-bounds write:** When the attacker controls the value of `new_capacity` and the `alloc` function returns an undersized buffer, there are write operations into a buffer that can lead to memory corruption and a crash (see comment #24 of bug 1185115).
*   **Use-after-free:** There is a secondary, but also very relevant effect that occurs if the return value of `setCapacity()` is a `NO_MEMORY` value which isn't checked. This means operations following this allocation failure can write to freed memory and cause a crash (see comment #24 of bug 1185115).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user running Firefox.
*   **Denial of Service:** A malformed MP4 file can lead to a crash of the application due to the memory corruption, or out of bounds write, resulting in a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network-exploitable, using a specially crafted MPEG4 video file delivered over the internet and viewed in Firefox.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage with a crafted video or opening a malicious local video file in Firefox.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:**  An attacker can be remote and does not require any specific position within the target's environment.
*   **Crafting Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting malicious MPEG-4 media files that trigger the specific integer overflow conditions within libstagefright.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `libstagefright` library, which is used by Firefox and other Mozilla products to process multimedia.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by an improperly sized `saio` chunk in an MPEG-4 file, specifically impacting memory allocation.
*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure enough memory is allocated for the requested capacity and other fixes are done to improve memory handling in related functions.
* Mozilla's bug tracker shows multiple patches being proposed and merged to address this, culminating in a fix for bug 1185115, which fixes the core integer overflow issue.
* Different vendors also address this vulnerability by patching their respective browsers.

In summary, CVE-2015-4479 is a critical vulnerability due to an integer overflow leading to potentially arbitrary code execution in the libstagefright library, impacting Firefox. An attacker can exploit it by tricking a user to view specially crafted MPEG4 video data, highlighting the need for updated browsers.
