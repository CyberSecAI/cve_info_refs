**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability:
- **XSS:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
- **Open Redirect:** Allows attackers to redirect users to malicious websites after they click on seemingly safe links.
- **Access Bypass:** Allows unauthorized users to access restricted content or functionality.
- **CSRF:** Allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.
- **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server.
- **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to full server compromise.
- **Information Disclosure:** Allows attackers to obtain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
Attack vectors depend on the type of vulnerability but generally involve:
- Injecting malicious scripts via user input or other vulnerabilities
- Crafting malicious URLs to redirect users or bypass access control
- Submitting crafted requests that manipulate data or perform unauthorized actions
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload functionality

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Typically requires the attacker to have some level of interaction with the affected Drupal site.
- Some attacks may require social engineering to trick users into clicking malicious links or submitting crafted requests.
- Some vulnerabilities may be exploited remotely.

Since the content provided is a list of vulnerability reports and CVE requests, it is impossible to definitively state that CVE-2015-4356 relates to any single report mentioned here.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content lists multiple vulnerabilities affecting various Drupal modules, but does not specifically mention CVE-2015-4356. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which specific vulnerability, if any, was assigned that CVE ID from the context.
