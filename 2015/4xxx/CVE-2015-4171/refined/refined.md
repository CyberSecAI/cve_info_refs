    "CVE-2015-4171": {
      "description": "strongSwan 4.3.0 through 5.x before 5.3.2 and strongSwan VPN Client before 1.4.6, when using EAP or pre-shared keys for authenticating an IKEv2 connection, does not enforce server authentication restrictions until the entire authentication process is complete, which allows remote servers to obtain credentials by using a valid certificate and then reading the responses.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that strongSwan does not enforce server authentication restrictions (e.g. rightid or rightca) until after all authentication steps, including EAP or pre-shared key exchange, are completed.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of proper server identity validation before completing authentication in IKEv2 when using EAP or pre-shared keys."
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious server, authenticated with a valid certificate from a trusted CA, can obtain the client's username and authentication value (e.g., MSCHAPv2 response) or even a plaintext password if EAP-GTC is used.",
         "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack via DNS spoofing to redirect the client to a rogue server that possesses a valid, trusted certificate.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to perform a DNS spoofing attack to redirect the client to a rogue server with a valid certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The rogue server needs a valid certificate, but it does not need to match the expected server's identity. "
