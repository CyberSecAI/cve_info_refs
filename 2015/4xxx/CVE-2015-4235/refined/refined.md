Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper implementation of access controls in the APIC filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Vulnerability in the cluster management configuration of the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch.
- Failure to properly restrict access to the APIC filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to the APIC as the *root* user.
- The attacker can then perform *root*-level commands on the APIC.
- Complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:C/I:C/A:C).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access via the network.
- Exploitation through the cluster management configuration of the APIC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to the affected system is required.
- Remote network access is necessary.
