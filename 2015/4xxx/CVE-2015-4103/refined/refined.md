    "Root cause": "Xen does not properly restrict write access to the host MSI message data field.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [

    "Attack vectors": "Local x86 HVM guest administrators with access to physical PCI devices (PCI pass-through) that are MSI-capable.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to an x86 HVM guest with passthrough PCI devices that are MSI-capable."
