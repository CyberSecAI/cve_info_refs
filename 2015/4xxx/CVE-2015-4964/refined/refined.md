- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The authentication token is displayed in the execution logs of IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of authentication token in execution logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Non-administrator users can impersonate the admin user or other users who started the process. This allows unauthorized viewing, editing, or running of processes on any objects within IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with permissions to create and execute processes can obtain the authentication token by examining execution logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with permission to create and execute processes within IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
