# Security Bulletin: Exposed Authentication Token in IBM UrbanCode Deploy (CVE-2015-4964)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

In previous versions of IBM UrbanCode Deploy, the authentication token is displayed in the execution logs. In certain steps that are run using the admin user permissions, this can allow non-administrator users to impersonate the admin user. In other processes, this can allow other users to impersonate the user who started the process. In either case, the token is invalidated when the step is completed.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-4964](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4964) A user of IBM UrbanCode Deploy with permission to create and execute processes can obtain the value of the admin AUTH\_TOKEN that is created. While the process is running, he can use the auth token to view, edit, or run processes on, any of the objects in IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
