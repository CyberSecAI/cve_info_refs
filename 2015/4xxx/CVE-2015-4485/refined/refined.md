Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4485:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly mentions CVE-2015-4485, with multiple sources confirming the vulnerability. Several sources describe a heap-based buffer overflow in `libvpx`'s `resize_context_buffers` function when decoding malformed WebM video data in Mozilla Firefox.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
  *   The root cause of this vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `resize_context_buffers` function within the `libvpx` library, which is used by Mozilla Firefox to decode WebM video data.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  *   **Heap-based buffer overflow**: The `resize_context_buffers` function in `libvpx` does not properly handle malformed WebM video data leading to a buffer overflow on the heap.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
  *   **Arbitrary code execution**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
  *   **Denial of service (DoS)**: Exploitation can also cause a denial of service through application crashes.
  *   **Information Disclosure**: Some reports mention the possibility of sensitive information disclosure, alongside arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack vectors:**
  *   **Network**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
  *   **Malicious WebM video**: The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted WebM video file.
  *   **User interaction**: A user must open/load a malicious web page with an embedded WebM video or be tricked into opening a malicious file using Firefox.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  *   **Remote attacker**: The attacker does not need physical access or local system access.
  *   **Ability to craft malicious WebM**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed WebM video file that triggers the buffer overflow.
  *   **User interaction**: The attacker must lure the victim to access the malicious WebM content using a vulnerable Firefox.

**Additional information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox before version 40.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2.
*   Several sources mention that this vulnerability is rated as "important" or "critical" severity.
*   Patches were provided by SUSE, RedHat, and Ubuntu and openSUSE to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using Address Sanitizer (ASan), a tool for detecting memory errors.
*   The vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities in `libvpx` during WebM video decoding.
