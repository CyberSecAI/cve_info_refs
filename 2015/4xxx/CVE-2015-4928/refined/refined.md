- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords for value-add services are stored in plain text within the Ambari configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Storage of sensitive information (passwords) in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could obtain the value-add service passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where the Ambari configuration file is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local attacker with access to the system and the Ambari configuration file.
