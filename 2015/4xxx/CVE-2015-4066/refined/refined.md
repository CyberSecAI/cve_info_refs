```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The GigPress WordPress plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input passed via the POST parameters 'show_artist_id' and 'show_venue_id' before using them in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database queries, potentially allowing them to read sensitive data, modify database content, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request with a crafted 'show_artist_id' or 'show_venue_id' parameters to the vulnerable admin page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with access to the GigPress plugin's admin interface.
