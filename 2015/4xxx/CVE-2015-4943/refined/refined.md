- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A sequence of connect and disconnect operations to the MQXR service can lead to a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The MQXR service is susceptible to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the MQXR service, requiring a restart to restore functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the MQXR service. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
