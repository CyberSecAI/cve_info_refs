   - All provided content relates to **CVE-2015-4620**

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how BIND performs DNSSEC validation. Specifically, the issue arises when BIND is resolving a name in an attacker-controlled domain with DNSSEC validation enabled.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
      - An uninitialized value within the `isSelfsigned()` function was used during DNSSEC validation, leading to an assertion failure.
      - The flaw relates to how BIND processes TKEY queries during DNSSEC validation.
      -  The issue relates to an improper check during DNSSEC trust anchor management when a key previously trusted is revoked with no other trusted keys available.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition because `named` (the BIND DNS server daemon) exits unexpectedly with an assertion failure. This makes the DNS server unavailable.
      -  Clients relying on the BIND resolver are unable to resolve domain names.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
      - A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making BIND resolve a name in an attacker-controlled domain.
      - An attacker can cause a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically crafted content
      - By sending specially crafted network traffic (TKEY queries) to a BIND resolver, a remote attacker can cause a DoS.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to control or influence a domain that the target BIND resolver attempts to resolve.
     - The attacker must be able to send DNS queries to a BIND server that has DNSSEC validation enabled.
     -  The vulnerability occurs early in packet handling, before typical ACL checks, meaning an attacker is able to cause a DoS even if access to the service is limited/denied.
     - An attacker must be able to make BIND resolve a name within their control.
   - The redhat information specifies that the vulnerability is triggered when a key previously trusted is revoked, and there are no other trusted keys available with a standby key not trusted yet. This condition has to be met for the vulnerability to be triggered

**3. Additional Details:**

   - The content from Red Hat and Debian indicate that the patch involves a backported fix to the affected BIND packages.
   - Red Hat explicitly states that the affected versions of `bind` in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, and `bind97` in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, all have the vulnerable `dnssec-validation yes` enabled by default
   -  The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20190903-0003) specifies OnCommand Balance as affected and provides a list of products not affected.
   - The Suse advisory provides a clear list of the Suse enterprise products affected, plus openSuse and Suse enterprise products that were not.

**4. Summary of Findings:**

   - The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw affecting BIND DNS servers when performing DNSSEC validation.
   - It stems from a flaw where an uninitialized value is used during DNSSEC validation when handling specific requests, leading to an unexpected crash.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by an attacker who controls the DNS records of a queried domain.
   - All the information highlights the same vulnerability, but each vendor (Red Hat, Debian, NetApp, Suse, Ubuntu) provides a unique list of the packages affected and how to fix them.
   - Red Hat has explicitly described the conditions required for the vulnerability to be exploited
