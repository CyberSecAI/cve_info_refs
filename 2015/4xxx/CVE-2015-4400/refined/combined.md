# CVE-2015-4400 : Backdoorbot, Network Configuration Leak on a Connected Doorbell

By
[Ruchna Nigam](/blog/search?author=Ruchna+Nigam)

 | January 22, 2016

### Summary

In March 2015, a Network Configuration Leak vulnerability was disclosed to Ring as part of FortiGuard's Responsible Disclosure process.

The vulnerability existed on their first internet-connected doorbell, Doorbot v1.0 but [other posts](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/steal-your-wi-fi-key-from-your-doorbell-iot-wtf/) on the subject show that the vulnerability was ported on newer versions of the connected doorbell as well.

The vulnerability had been granted CVE-2015-4400: DoorBot Network Configuration Leak.

We have issued an Advisory and IPS signatures (**DoorBot.Network.Configuration.Leak**) for the same.

We have not been informed by Ring about any patches issued for the reported vulnerability.

### Connected Doorbell?

The Ring, formerly known as Doorbot, is a connected doorbell that comes with network capabilities. It connects to a user's home Wi-Fi and allows the owner to interact with visitors via the doorbell from a smartphone, or receive mobile alerts about every ring on the doorbell. It can also be connected to existing doorbell wiring to allow answering the door using a smartphone.

In March 2015, I found a vulnerability that allows it to let visitors into your home Wi-Fi network as well.

### Proof of Concept

Put simply, the vulnerability can be attributed to the poor configuration of it's GainSpan Wi-Fi module that provides an API to recover the Doorbot's network configuration in Plain Text.

![](/content/dam/fortinet-blog/new-images/uploads/cve-2015-4400-backdoorbot-network-configuration-leak-on-a-connected-doorbell-2807.png)

On a sidenote, speaking of Plain Text Credentials, the Doorbot Android application analysed in March 2015, stored the logged in users' credentials in Plain-Text on the  phone. The good news is this was fixed by Ring soon after in future updates of the application.

### Exploitation

Doorbot's claim to security until now was the inaccessibility of the Reset button at the back of the device, thanks to their proprietary screw (that also incidentally is what protects the device from theft).

In my experience with the device, any average Joe screw-driver can be used to unscrew the device and access the Reset button, which ironically has been made more accessible on newer versions of the device.

I guess that leaves us with 'Encryption to the Rescue!' to at least protect your Wi-Fi Credentials.

Not only can the vulnerability be exploited by an attacker when the device is in use, by gaining access to the Reset button, it could also be exploited in the case of Doorbots that are re-sold or discarded, revealing network information from the previous owner/setup at the press of a button.

(We won't be selling our Doorbot anytime soon ;))

### More on GainSpan modules

GainSpan Wi-Fi modules are generally used add the 'Internet' to 'Internet of Things' devices i.e. they provide these devices with their ability to connect to the Internet.

They are designed to support two modes of operation :

* **Limited Access Point (AP)** : As the name suggests, while in this mode, the IoT device can act as an Access Point for a limited period of time. In the case of the Doorbot/Ring, this mode is used while setting up the device. When in this mode, the user can connect to the Doorbot's Access Point and, using the Doorbot/Ring mobile application, send it details of which Wi-Fi network it should use. The Doorbot's Access Point is named by the convention DoorbotAp\_XXXXXX where the last 6 characters correspond to the end of the Doorbot's MAC Address.

  The device can be made to switch to Limited AP mode by pressing the Reset button illustrated above.
* **Infrastructure Client** : In this mode, the IoT device behaves like any other Wi-Fi capable client and connects to a Wi-Fi network. The GainSpan module, and hence the device it's on, operates in this mode for regular usage.

This is not the first time a poorly configured GainSpan module has leaked a user's network configuration - previously observed on [Twine](https://gist.github.com/mheffner/4404975) and [Wi-Fi Smart Scales](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/extracting-your-wpa-psk-from-bathroom-scales/) stressing the importance of secure configuration and implementation of these ready-to-use technologies on IoT devices.

Although this vulnerability has made *BackDoorbot*a reality, considering the fact that one would need to be within the Wi-Fi network's range to be able to exploit it, a *Doorbotnet*remains a theoretical concept.

# Steal your Wi-Fi key from your doorbell? IoT WTF!

David Lodge
08 Jan 2016

The Ring is a Wi-Fi doorbell that connects to your home Wi-Fi. It’s a really cool device that allows you to answer callers from your mobile phone, even when you’re not home.

It’s one of the few IoT devices we’ve looked at that we might even use ourselves. It acts as a CCTV camera, automatically activating if people come close to your home. You can talk to them, to delivery couriers, to visitors etc. It can even hook up to some smart door locks, so you can let guests in to your home.

It is genuinely useful! Unlike most IoT devices :-)

![ringPacking](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringPacking](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringPacking.png)

### BUT

To set it up, one has to connect it to your home Wi-Fi router. That requires that you give it your Wi-Fi key. Here’s where the problem lies.

First some analysis of the hardware.

The major component is the doorbell itself, which is comprised of the necessary circuitry, a li-ion battery, a USB charging port for the battery and a set up button. This is connected to a back plate which attaches the doorbell to the wall and can provide power from an AC source.

![ringInternal](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringInternal](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringInternal.png)

Once set up, you fix it to the outside of your house. It’s secured with two Torx T4 screws.

![ringScrews](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringScrews](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringScrews.png)

…which means it is extremely vulnerable to theft. Indeed, Ring offer a free replacement if stolen.

### The attack, stealing the Wi-Fi key

Take off the door mounting, flip it over and press the orange ‘set up’ button.

![ringBack](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringBack](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringBack.png)

Pressing the setup button sets the doorbell’s wireless module (a Gainspan wireless unit) into AP mode. This might sound very familiar if you [read our post about the Fitbit Aria scales vulnerability](https://www.pentestpartners.com/blog/extracting-your-wpa-psk-from-bathroom-scales/%20).

An access point is created with this format:

Ring-1ea7a2

…where the last three octets are the end of the MAC address. Simply connect to it.

From here the Gainspan’s HTTP server can be connected-to, to talk directly to the wireless module via a REST style API.

![ringGainspaninternal](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringGainspaninternal](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringGainspaninternal.png)

If the URL /gainspan/system/config/network is requested from the web server running on the Gainspan unit, the wireless configuration is returned **including the configured SSID and PSK in cleartext.**

The doorbell is only secured to its back plate by two standard screws. This means that it is possible for an attacker to gain access to the homeowner’s wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL.

As it is just a simple URL this can be performed quite easily from a mobile device such as a phone and could be performed without any visible form of tampering to the unit.

An example:

[![ringPSK](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![ringPSK](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringPSK-300x174.png)](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2016/01/ringPSK.png)

This is quite a fail: walk up to door, remove doorbell, retrieve users Wi-Fi key, own their network!

1. Did Ring ever intend to expose this functionality, or was is this just default functionality that Gainspan have in their firmware? As it’s a standard Gainspan URL it looks like they just hadn’t disabled the configuration.
2. The Wi-Fi key is still stored in the doorbell somewhere – how well protected is it now? It’s most likely stored in the module, somebody with a soldering iron could possibly get it.
3. Having physical access to the doorbell means we might be able to upload modified firmware. Your doorbell becomes a back door?

### HOWEVER

Kudos is due to Ring for responding to our vulnerability alert within a matter of minutes. A firmware update was released earlier this week that fixes this issue, just two weeks after we disclosed it to them privately. Good job Ring!
