Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `RemoteObjectInvocationHandler` class within the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) component of OpenJDK. This class incorrectly allowed calls to the `finalize()` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper restriction on calling the `finalize()` method through the `RemoteObjectInvocationHandler`. Normally, the finalize method is intended to be called by the garbage collector before an object is garbage collected, but this flaw allowed it to be called remotely, bypassing security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could bypass Java sandbox restrictions. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or other unauthorized activities. In essence, it could allow an untrusted Java application or applet to gain escalated privileges or perform operations it should not be allowed to.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through untrusted Java applications or applets that are executed in a context where RMI calls are possible. This would typically involve network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to be able to:

*   Deploy or execute an untrusted Java application or applet on a vulnerable system where RMI is accessible.
*   Craft a malicious RMI request that attempts to call the finalize() method on a remote object.
*   Have network connectivity to a vulnerable target that's running the vulnerable code.

**Additional Information from the provided content**
*   The vulnerability affects OpenJDK and IBM JDK.
*   Patches for this vulnerability include preventing direct calls of the finalize() method through `RemoteObjectInvocationHandler`.
*   The fix provides a mechanism (sun.rmi.server.invocationhandler.allowFinalizeInvocation system property) to re-enable the finalize method call, if necessary.
*   Several Red Hat Security Advisories address this vulnerability across various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions and Java distributions.
*   SUSE also released security updates to remediate this vulnerability.

The advisory information confirms that CVE-2015-4733 is related to the incorrect handling of finalize() methods in OpenJDK's RMI implementation allowing sandbox bypass.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root cause:** Incorrect handling of finalize() method calls in `RemoteObjectInvocationHandler`.
*   **Weakness:** Missing restriction on calling `finalize()` remotely.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of Java sandbox restrictions, potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Untrusted Java applications or applets via RMI.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Needs to deploy malicious Java code remotely and initiate a crafted RMI request.
