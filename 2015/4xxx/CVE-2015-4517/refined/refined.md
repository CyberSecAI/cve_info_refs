{
  "CVE-2015-4517": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-119",
      "Description": "NetworkUtils.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors."
    },
    "Content": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to memory safety issues within the NetworkUtils.cpp file, specifically when handling input strings in `snprintf` function calls. These functions do not ensure null-termination or correctly handle potential overflows, leading to memory corruption and crashes.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use of `snprintf` without proper bounds checking or null-termination guarantees.",
          "Potential for out-of-bounds memory access due to improper string handling.",
          "Lack of input sanitization or validation on user-controlled input."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or potentially have unspecified other impact.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by maliciously crafted web content that exploits the vulnerable code paths in `NetworkUtils.cpp`.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting web content that exercises the vulnerable code paths.",
      "Affected software": [
        "Mozilla Firefox before 41.0",
        "Mozilla Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3",
        "Mozilla Thunderbird",
		"SeaMonkey"
      ]
    }
