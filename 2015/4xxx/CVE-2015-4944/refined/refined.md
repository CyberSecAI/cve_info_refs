- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website. This could be used to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL that, when clicked, executes the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim to click the link. The attacker requires the ability to get the victim to load the crafted URL in their browser.
