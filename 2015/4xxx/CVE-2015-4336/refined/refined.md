Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The XCloner WordPress plugin, when configured for manual backup mode, reads content from a user-supplied file (specified by the `excl_manual` parameter) and passes this content directly to the `exec()` function. This occurs in `cloner.functions.php` at line 1205.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is that the content of the user-supplied file is used in a call to the `exec()` function.  This allows for arbitrary commands to be executed on the server by an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the WordPress site. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, website defacement, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is initiated via an HTTP request to the WordPress admin interface, specifically targeting the `plugins.php` page of the XCloner plugin.
- The `excl_manual` parameter is used to specify the path to a file containing commands that will be executed.
- The attacker must be logged into the WordPress admin panel in order to change plugin settings to use the "manual" backup configuration and supply the file path via the 'excl_manual' parameter.
- A file is created under `administrator/backups/.comments` using the backup comments feature and is filled with commands to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress administrator in order to access and modify plugin settings to the manual backup method.
- They also must have the ability to create content for a file on the server, which the advisory mentions can be achieved using the backup comment feature and located in `/administrator/backups/.comments`.
- The attacker must also know the path to this newly created file in order to specify the `excl_manual` parameter value.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory also points out a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability with the `excl_manual` parameter itself (CVE-2015-4337) and PHP code injection vulnerability within the plugin's translation functionality (CVE-2015-4338)
- The advisory includes a concrete example of how to achieve RCE by creating a file with the command `id > /tmp/w00t` using the backup comment feature, then setting the `excl_manual` parameter to the path of the file.
- The `tarpath` and `tarcompress` variables are used in the `exec()` call, this could be useful information for crafting a specific attack payload.
