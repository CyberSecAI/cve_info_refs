Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-4512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read during 2D canvas rendering on Linux systems when using a 16-bit color depth. This occurs because the Cairo graphics library is improperly used when a 32-bit color depth surface is created but then displayed on a 16-bit color depth system, a configuration which Cairo does not fully support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer. This happens in `gfx/2d/DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp` during the copying of surface data.
*   **Improper Graphics Library Usage**: The software attempts to use the Cairo graphics library in an unsupported manner, leading to memory corruption and read issues. Specifically, the combination of 32-bit surface creation with a 16-bit display context triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary memory from the heap following the memory for the 16-bit surface.
*   **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the application due to memory access violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages with Malicious Canvas Elements:** Attackers can craft malicious web pages that use the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to trigger the vulnerable code during 2D rendering. This enables the attack to be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Execution Not Required** The attacker does not need to inject code to cause this vulnerability, simply rendering a maliciously crafted canvas will trigger the issue.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a specially crafted website or opening a crafted HTML document.
*  **Target System Configuration:**  Specifically, the attack targets Linux systems using Firefox with a 16-bit color depth configuration. Other operating systems and color depths do not appear to be affected.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using the Address Sanitizer tool.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox and SeaMonkey.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 41 and SeaMonkey 2.38.
*   The issue is specific to the Linux operating system in certain configurations and does not affect Windows or OS X.
*   SUSE information indicates a CVSS v2 base score of 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P) with a "moderate" severity.
*   Ubuntu indicates a "specically crafted website" is needed to trigger this, which aligns with crafted canvas elements
*   There are indications from the bug reports that this issue is due to an incorrect format detected with Cairo xlib in 16-bit mode (cairo xlib 16-bit) and that the fix involved explicitly setting a format instead of relying on automatic detection to create offscreen surfaces.
*   There was a concern regarding the security rating, initially a sec-high, downgraded to a sec-moderate because the vulnerability only affects a small subset of users using 16-bit color depth, but backporters should consider a sec-high rating in some edge cases.
