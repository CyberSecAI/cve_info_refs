Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-4084

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It arises because the `Free Counter` WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database using the `update_option` function. Specifically, the plugin takes the value of `$_POST['value_']` and stores it directly into the database without any escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the application's database. This stored script is then executed when a user visits a page that displays the plugin's widget.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The plugin fails to sanitize or escape the `value_` POST parameter before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `value_`, which is sent via POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=check_stat`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they visit a page with the Free Counter widget.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover:** Depending on the attacker's injected JavaScript, they could perform actions such as redirecting the user to a malicious website, stealing session cookies, capturing user input, or performing actions on behalf of the user within the WordPress site.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could deface the website by injecting malicious code that alters its content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request to `Api.php`:** Initially, an attacker sends a POST request to the plugin's `Api.php` file to obtain a counter ID by providing the vulnerable website's URL.
*   **HTTP POST Request to `admin-ajax.php`:**  The core exploit involves sending a crafted POST request to `http://my.vulnerable.website.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=check_stat`. The attacker includes the previously obtained `counter_id` and a malicious JavaScript payload within the `value_` parameter (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`).
*   **Widget Display:** The injected script executes when a user visits a page where the Free Counter widget is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of Target Website:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker needs to send two HTTP POST requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** As stated in the description, any authenticated or unauthenticated user can perform this exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is in version 1.1 of the plugin
*   The exploit description notes that even though the `update_option` function is used, which would normally escape certain characters, the attacker can bypass it by omitting quotes in the `src` attribute of the script tag. Modern browsers will still interpret the tag correctly.
*   The plugin has been closed as of July 21, 2021, due to a guideline violation, and is no longer available for download.
*   No official solution is mentioned in the exploit description.
