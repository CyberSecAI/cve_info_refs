Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An off-by-one buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `mspack/mszipd.c` file of the `libmspack` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one buffer over-read.
- Specifically, this occurs within the `inflate` function of `mspack/mszipd.c`.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the decompression of MSZIP compressed data, particularly when handling specific CAB files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- While the report initially suggests the vulnerability might not be exploitable, it does cause a global-buffer-overflow, as detected by AddressSanitizer. This could potentially lead to a crash or possibly further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted CAB file.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the `mszipd_decompress` function call while extracting data from a CAB file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted CAB file to the application using the vulnerable library.
- The attacker does not need local access to the system beyond the ability to supply the malicious file.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was identified using AddressSanitizer, which detected the global buffer overflow.
- The issue is triggered by the `cabd_md5` test program which internally calls `mszipd_decompress`.
- The bug was fixed in version 0.5-1 of the `libmspack` library.
- CVE-2015-4470 was assigned for the issue in the `libmspack` library.
