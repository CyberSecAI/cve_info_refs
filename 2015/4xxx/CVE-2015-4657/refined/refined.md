The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mailbird.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Mailbird handles HTML content in emails. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or neutralize HTML tags within the email body, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization of HTML content in emails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an email. When the email is viewed in Mailbird, the malicious script executes in the context of the Mailbird application.
- The attacker could potentially steal user data, manipulate the application, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted email containing malicious HTML with JavaScript.
- The email is sent to a user who uses the Mailbird application, and the XSS payload triggers when the recipient opens/views the crafted email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the targeted user/s.
- No special position or access within the target system is required, only the ability to send emails.
