**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-4612 ( যদিও CVE ID not assigned in the advisory, it is the same vulnerability )

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the "FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions" (js_faq) TYPO3 extension. This lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server itself.
    - Modify website content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable input fields. The advisory mentions that the attacker requires "Authenticated Access" (Au:S)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable extension is a third-party extension and is not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
