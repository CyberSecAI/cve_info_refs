Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-4935:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when processing opcode 4755 within the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow:  A crafted packet sent to the server via TCP port 11460 can overflow a buffer on the stack during the processing of opcode 4755.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker can execute code within the context of the SYSTEM user, gaining full control of the affected machine.
- Server Crash: The buffer overflow could potentially cause the server to crash.
- Potential information disclosure as noted in the IBM bulletin.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a specially crafted packet over the network.
- TCP Port: The attack occurs via TCP port 11460.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Network connectivity: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server's TCP port 11460.
- Ability to send specially crafted packets: The attacker needs to be able to create and send malicious data packets.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack versions 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.12.0.
- A fix is available in version 6.1.12.1
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Brian Gorenc working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS score is 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating the highest severity level, due to the fact that it is remotely exploitable, requires no authentication, and allows for complete compromise of the system.
