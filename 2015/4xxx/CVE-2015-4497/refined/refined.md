Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-4497:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free, specifically occurring in the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` implementation within Mozilla Firefox. This happens when a resize event is triggered concurrently with style changes to a `<canvas>` element. The original canvas context is destroyed and recreated due to style changes, while a reference to the old context is still used, which leads to the vulnerability being triggered.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Dangling Pointer:** The core issue is that after a style flush (triggered by a resize event), a raw pointer (specifically a pointer to the `nsPresShell`'s style set) to a canvas context becomes a dangling pointer. Subsequent use of this dangling pointer causes a crash or can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Improper Handling of Events:** The resize event and style changes interact in a way that destroys the old context while still referencing it. This suggests an issue with event handling and context lifecycle management within the browser engine.
*   **Lack of Refcounting**: The `SetFont()` method was using a raw pointer instead of a refcounted pointer, causing the presShell to be released while the `SetFont` operation was still pending.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting the vulnerability can cause the browser to crash.
*   **Memory Corruption**: There is also potential for general memory corruption

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious web page containing a specially crafted `<canvas>` element and accompanying JavaScript that triggers a resize event in combination with style changes.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by getting a user to load a malicious page.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction in the form of visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious web page.
*   **Ability to Craft HTML/JavaScript**: The attacker needs the ability to write and deploy a web page that uses the `<canvas>` API and JavaScript code that will trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Target Users Browser**: The user needs to have a vulnerable version of Firefox running and load the malicious website.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The use-after-free occurs specifically when the `nsPresShell` (presentation shell) is destroyed due to the canvas element being recreated during style changes or resize event, while the code still tries to access it. This is due to a raw pointer being stored locally in the `CanvasRenderingContext2D` implementation which becomes invalid when the `nsPresShell` is destroyed.
* The crash occurs when methods such as `CanvasRenderingContext2D::SetFont` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D::GetFontStyleContext` are called and try to access information via the invalid presShell pointer after style flushing. The style flush is triggered by the canvas resize event handler via `PresShell::FlushPendingNotifications`.
*   The issue was independently found by both Jean-Max Reymond and Ucha Gobejishvili (working with HP's Zero Day Initiative).
*   The fix involves ensuring the `nsPresShell` is alive via refcounting for as long as the operation is using it.
*   The original fix involved making the methods accessing the `PresShell` use `nsCOMPtr` instead of raw pointers. Further investigation revealed additional unsafe calls and the fix evolved to ensure the lifetime of all needed objects.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Mozilla Firefox before 40.0.3
*   Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2.1
*   Firefox OS before 2.2
*   SeaMonkey is also mentioned as being affected, but specific versions are not provided in all the content.

**Mitigation/Resolution:**

*   Upgrade to Firefox 40.0.3 or later, Firefox ESR 38.2.1 or later, or Seamonkey 2.35 or later.
*   Patches are available to address the vulnerability.
* SUSE also provided updates for multiple SLES versions that included fixes.

**CVSS Scores**
*   CVSS v2 Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
*   CVSS v2 Base Score: 10 in some reports
*  SUSE classifies this as a critical severity issue
