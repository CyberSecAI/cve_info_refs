This document gives examples of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call flows. Elements in these call flows include SIP User Agents and Clients, SIP Proxy and Redirect Servers. Scenarios include SIP Registration and SIP session establishment. Call flow diagrams and message details are shown. Johnston, et al. Best Current Practice [Page 1]

2000

With the growth of presence based services, it is important to securely manage and distribute sensitive presence information such as user location. We survey techniques that are used for security and privacy of presence information. In particular, we describe the SIMPLE based presence specific authentication, integrity and confidentiality. We also discuss the IETF's common policy for geo-privacy, presence authorization for presence information privacy and distribution of different levels of presence information to different watchers. Additionally, we describe an open problem of getting the aggregated presence from the trusted server without the server knowing the presence information, and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss denial of service attacks on the presence system and ways to mitigate them.

The aim of the project is to study videoconferencing (or simply VC) protocols in detail and check whether they meet up with the real-time constraints like call setup delay, jitter etc and come up with some necessary modifications depending on the needs. The scope of the project also includes mechanisms for firewall traversal without affecting the security of the internal network. Two more popular protocols for VC are Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) and H.. Based on the comparative study of both protocols, it’s proposed to develop enhanced protocols which will supplement existing protocols to overcome performance limitations. These modifications in protocol shall also take care of maintaining the compatibility with commercial equipment based on current international standards. It is also planned to carry out information security vulnerability assessment based on suitable metrics for both existing as well as the enhanced protocol.

The horizontally layered architecture of the IMS/NGN standards family enables the delivery of services independent of access network and requesting device. In this article, the authors propose a further separation of service control and delivery, allowing the requesting device -in particular a user's mobile phone -to invite other deviceswe will focus on DLNA appliances -into the service delivery, thereby enhancing both user experience and service design flexibility. The proposed solution builds on exploiting proximity technologies (e.g. barcodes, NFC) for pairing the control device with a remote environment. Motivated by scenarios, the architecture concepts are explained and a prototype implemented for validation is described. Selected findings and a short overview of related standardization efforts conclude the paper.
