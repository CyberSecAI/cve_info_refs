Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of file downloads within Oracle Endeca Information Discovery Integrator. Specifically, the software fails to sanitize the file paths of files to be downloaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:**  The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, potentially accessing files outside of the intended directory.
- **Authentication Bypass:** While authentication is required to trigger the file download functionality, an authentication bypass is reportedly known to exist, which exacerbates the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive server configuration files.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By accessing configuration files, an attacker can gain access with the privileges of the "clover" server, likely leading to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **HTTP:** The attack vector involves HTTP requests, as it is related to file downloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.
- **Authentication (initial):**  The attacker needs some form of authentication to trigger the vulnerable functionality. However, an authentication bypass is known to exist.
- **Knowledge of file paths:** Attacker needs knowledge of the file structure to access sensitive configuration files.

**Additional details:**

- Oracle has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 2015-02-25, and a coordinated public release happened on 2015-07-20.
- CVSS score is 6.5.
- Affected products include "Endeca Tools and Frameworks".
