Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which relate to CVE-2015-4656:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper HTML encoding of user-supplied input in Synology Photo Station. Specifically, the `success` parameter in `login.php` and URL parameters in `index.php` are not sanitized before being included in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerabilities present are reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

*   **`login.php`:** The `success` GET parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output without encoding.
*  **`index.php`:** URL parameters are not properly encoded before being used in the application's response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary client-side scripts within the victim's browser.
*   Steal session tokens or login credentials.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   Redirect the victim to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs. Attackers can craft malicious links that, when clicked by a victim, inject malicious JavaScript code into the context of the Photo Station web application.

*   **`login.php`:**  The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `success` parameter. Example: `http:///photo/m/login.php?success=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
*   **`index.php`:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in a URL parameter.  Example: `http:///photo/?t="><IFRAME>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to:
*   Craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads.
*   Trick victims into clicking the malicious links. This can be achieved through social engineering, email phishing, or other methods of distributing the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**
The content provides more specific details than the typical CVE description, including:
*   The exact vulnerable files (`login.php` and `index.php`)
*   Code snippets showing the vulnerable code
*   Specific example URLs demonstrating the exploit
*   The affected version of Synology Photo Station (6.2-2858) and the fixed version (6.3-2945).
