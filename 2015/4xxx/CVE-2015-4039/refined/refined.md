  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient access control in the `iv_membership_update_user_settings` AJAX action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege escalation vulnerability due to lack of proper authorization checks."
    ],
    "impact": "A regular user can modify their user role to administrator, gaining full control of the infected website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a crafted `action` and `form_data`."

    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and escaping of user-supplied data in profile update fields.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization."
