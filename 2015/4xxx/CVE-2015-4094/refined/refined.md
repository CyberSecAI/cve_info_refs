Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Thycotic Password Manager Secret Server iOS application does not properly validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to a secure site.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of SSL certificate validation. This means the application does not verify the authenticity of the server it's communicating with, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by presenting a bogus SSL certificate.
- The application will accept this fraudulent certificate silently without warning the user.
- This allows the attacker to intercept and capture sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, and other data transmitted by the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the user's device and the legitimate server. This could be achieved by compromising a network device or through malicious Wi-Fi access points.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a fraudulent SSL certificate that will be accepted by the vulnerable application.

**Additional notes:**
- Thycotic chose to release a new application, Thycotic PAM, as a replacement rather than patching the vulnerable Secret Server application.
- Users of the vulnerable Secret Server iOS app are advised to change their passwords and consider switching to the new application.
