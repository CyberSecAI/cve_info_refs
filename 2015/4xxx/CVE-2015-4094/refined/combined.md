## Issue

The Thycotic Password Manager Secret Server iOS application does not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to a secure site.
## Impact

An attacker could perform a man in the middle attack by presenting a bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Usernames, passwords and sensitive information could be captured by an attacker without the user's knowledge.
## Timeline

February 1, 2015 - Notified Thycotic via security@thycotic.com, e-mail bounced

February 1, 2015 - Resent to secure@thycotic.com & info@thycotic.com, e-mail to secure@thycotic.com bounced

February 2, 2015 - Thycotic confirmed the vulnerability and advised that an update to resolve the issue would be released by the end of the week

February 12, 2015 - Thycotic advised that the update will be released shortly

February 24, 2015 - Thycotic advised that the update has been pushed out for another month or two

March 21, 2015 - Thycotic advised that the update has been provided to Apple for their verification

May 26, 2015 - Thycotic released the Thycotic PAM iOS application which they state is a replacement for the Thycotic Secret Server iOS application
## Solution

Thycotic has chosen to release a new application instead of updating the existing Secret Server application. If you use the Secret Server iOS application, you'll likely want to log in to your Secret Server instance or https://secretserveronline.com with a browser, change your password(s) and decide if you want to use the new application.

### Dated, painful to use password manager

> The software runs and thatâs about as positive as I can get.
>
> Secret Server is a powerful enterprise tool, but every single end user-facing part of it is terrible. Their browser extensions are awful, so it wasnât shocking to see that this app is pretty terrible as well. Iâve complained to our account rep about the poor quality of the end user side of their software and I feel like they just wonât acknowledge how important it is that user-facing software has to be good for proper adoption to take place. How am I supposed to encourage my users to be safe with passwords and use our company password manager if I canât even stand using the thing?

### At Least it Works on iPad

> Thankfully itâs not the atrocious beast that was Secret Server, which didnât run on iPad. Thatâs the only good. Why doesnât this run in landscape or allow a left-side tree view like the actual webpage? Seems clunky and sophomoric for an enterprise-app.

### I have to re-enter every field every time I want to login

> I used to just have to enter my password and the 2fa when I wanted to login. Now I have to type in 5 fields to access my passwords. The former option was even barely tolerable in this day and age when I should be able to use touch-ID and skip 2fa from my phone. PLEASE FIX THIS! Itâs making my work days hell.
