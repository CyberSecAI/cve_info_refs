    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2015-4632",
      "Description": "Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in (1) /cgi-bin/koha/svc/virtualshelves/search and (2) in /cgi-bin/koha/svc/members/search"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `template_path` parameter.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Path traversal"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request with a malicious `template_path` parameter to the vulnerable endpoints."
      ],
      "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to send crafted requests to the web application. No authentication is required."
    },
   "Affected_Products": [
        "Koha 3.20.x <= 3.20.1",
        "Koha 3.18.x <= 3.18.8",
