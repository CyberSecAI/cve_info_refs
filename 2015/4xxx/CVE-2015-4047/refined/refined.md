Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-4047:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `gssapi_init` function within the `racoon/gssapi.c` file of the ipsec-tools package. Specifically, the code accesses `iph1->rmconf->proposal->gssid` without ensuring that `iph1->rmconf` is not NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **NULL pointer dereference:** The code attempts to dereference the `rmconf` member of the `iph1` structure without checking if `rmconf` has been initialized, leading to a crash if it is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send specially crafted UDP packets to the IKE daemon (racoon), triggering the NULL pointer dereference and causing the daemon to crash. This effectively disrupts IPsec services.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending malicious UDP packets to the vulnerable service over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system to send the crafted UDP packets.
- **No authentication:** The attack can be performed without prior authentication, because the crash occurs in the initial IKE negotiation stage.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable service:** The attacker needs to know that the target system is running a vulnerable version of ipsec-tools, and that `HAVE_GSSAPI` is enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when `HAVE_GSSAPI` is enabled.
- The exploit requires sending two UDP packets.
- The fix involves adding a check for `iph1->rmconf == NULL` before accessing its members.

The provided information confirms the vulnerability and gives additional details, such as the specific code location, an example exploit, and the suggested fix.
