- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing a remote attacker to inject specially-crafted SQL statements into the back-end database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send specially-crafted SQL statements to exploit the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application. The CVSS vector indicates that low privileges are required. (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
