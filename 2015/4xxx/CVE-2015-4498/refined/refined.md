  "CVE-2015-4498": {
    "description": "The add-on installation feature in Mozilla Firefox before 40.0.3 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2.1 allows remote attackers to bypass an intended user-confirmation requirement by constructing a crafted data: URL and triggering navigation to an arbitrary http: or https: URL at a certain early point in the installation process.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "weakness": "Bypassing the add-on install permission prompt",
        "attack_vector": "A crafted website using a data: URL to trigger add-on installation.",
        "impact": "An attacker could install a malicious add-on without the user's explicit consent by bypassing the add-on installation prompt.",
        "root_cause": "The browser incorrectly handles data: URLs in the context of add-on installations, allowing manipulation of the add-on's URL, simulating direct user action, thus bypassing the install permission prompt. Additionally, the actual installation prompt can be made to appear above another site's location via a forced page navigation, further tricking the user into believing they are installing from a trusted source.",
          "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a website with a malicious data: URL and then trick the user into visiting that website.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the browser trusts a data: URL that appears to simulate direct user input of the add-on's URL, thereby bypassing the install permission prompt. Additionally, the installation prompt can be made to appear over another site by a page navigation, leading users to believe a trusted site initiated the install, making the bypass more effective."
