# USN-2723-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

27 August 2015

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing a canvas element during

restyling in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-4497](/security/CVE-2015-4497))

Bas Venis discovered that the addon install permission prompt could be

bypassed using data: URLs in some circumstances. It was also discovered

that the installation notification could be made to appear over another

site. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to install a malicious addon.

([CVE-2015-4498](/security/CVE-2015-4498))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=943558#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2015-08-28 06:45:34 UTC  ``` Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-95  Add-on notification bypass through data URLs   Announced    August 27, 2015 Reporter     Bas Venis Impact       High Products     Firefox              Firefox ESR Fixed in     Firefox 40.0.3              Firefox ESR 38.2.1  Description  Security researcher Bas Venis reported a mechanism where add-ons could be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally, when a user enters the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar, warning prompts are bypassed because it is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL, which would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the absence of the permission prompt, it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a trusted site (such as addons.mozilla.org) has initiated the installation. This could lead to users installing an add-on from a malicious source.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2015-4497)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled installation of add-ons.
An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the add-on installation prompt,
and trick the user inso installing an add-on from a malicious source.
(CVE-2015-4498)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Jean-Max Reymond, Ucha Gobejishvili, and Bas Venis as
the original reporters of these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 38.2.1 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-95

## Add-on notification bypass through data URLs

Announced
August 27, 2015
Reporter
Bas Venis
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 40.0.3
* Firefox ESR 38.2.1
* SeaMonkey 2.35

### Description

Security researcher **Bas Venis** reported a mechanism where add-ons could
be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally, when a user enters
the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar, warning prompts are bypassed because it
is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a `data:` URL could be
manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL, which
would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the
absence of the permission prompt, it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt
to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after
triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a
trusted site (such as [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/)) has
initiated the installation. This could lead to users installing an add-on from a malicious
source.

Normally Firefox warns the user when trying to install add-on if this was page-initiated.
When the page is redirecting or navigating by <a href link, JavaScript or server redirect, Firefox trows the
'Firefox prevented this site (site.com) from asking you to install software on your computer.' warning at the user, which needs to explicitly be accepted for the add-on to continue installing.
There is however, a simple vulnerability that lets an attacker bypass this dialog, which allows a rather nasty attack on the user.
Basically, there is one exception in which the dialog will not be shown, which is if the user pastes or copies the direct link/URL in the URL bar.
Now the user could just click on links, redirects etc that lead to this page, because a data uri redirected to the page which itself redirects with a 'page moved header' to the location of the add-on, will disrupt that 'chain' and installation of the add-on will start without the dialog. As if the user typed it in directly.
This behavior in combination with a properly timed attack will result in a scenario where the user will download the add-on controlled by the attacker, the legit add-on webpage shown with it. The only thing not correct is the url of the pushed add-on, which the user CANNOT verify. This dialog is really only useful if the download location is from another domain. Since it will only show the <https://addons.mozzila.org/firefox/download/latest/123/randomurl> .. [truncated].
So the attacker will simply upload his unreviewed add-on, with the same name and icon as the desired add-on to be spoofed. Sure, this will eventually be reviewed and picked up or reported in the process. But in the meanwhile the direct link will be used. And since the reputation of the spoofed add-on that is being pushed doesn't matter (user never views that page). There is no way for the user to notice that the add-on is spoofed.
Attached are the files that would be running on the server.
Demonstration of the issue: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTKblGpeW4Y> (unlisted)

That's an intentional exception. The block is more of an anti-annoyance feature so sites can't pester people into giving in and installing (the next dialog is the actual security prompt). It's known that if you can white-wash your referer away you can mimic this, but then you're generally not at the same site so you can't keep annoying the user that way. Acceptable risk unless we see people start to abuse it, basically.
Spoofing people with the AMO origin of unreviewed add-ons, however, is clever.
Wil: would it be possible to require people to be signed into AMO to reach download links for unreviewed add-ons? Or failing that, maybe change the server to reject such links if the referer for the download doesn't come from AMO itself? Either would pretty much eliminate the potential for spoofing here.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(clouserw)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

The youtube video never loads for me and the video in the zip file shows a desktop but flickers so much I can't tell what is going on. So, I can't tell entirely what we're talking about - when you say "unreviewed add-on" are you talking about a preliminarily reviewed add-on? Can you put in specific steps to reproduce this so I can get a better idea of what's going on?
Regarding the questions: It's possible to require people be signed in, but I'm not sure it's something we'd want to do. I think we used to require people be signed in to download add-ons which weren't fully reviewed (when we had the yellow/black stripes on the buttons - it was a long time ago) and we got enough of a negative reaction to it that we stopped doing it. Jorge could probably give more info. We'd also have to ask if that would really change anything about the scenario.
Regarding referrers, that depends what URL is being pasted in. If it's a download link on AMO, potentially we could, but if it's a cached URL directly to the file then probably not. We may also interfere with legitimate 3rd party sites that link to AMO directly on purpose (and add their own src=\_\_\_ to the URL for tracking and such).Flags: needinfo?(clouserw)

As I understand it, the attacker uses some trickery to directly load the URL that points to the XPI file of an unreviewed add-on on AMO. This bypasses the warning that should appear for non-AMO add-ons, and also the warnings we show on AMO for unreviewed add-ons. This would only work while the version is waiting in the queue, which can range from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the add-on and reviewer availability.
Note that this is only about unreviewed add-ons in the queue, not preliminarily approved add-ons. The latter are checked for security issues, just like fully reviewed add-ons.

We expose unreviewed add-ons and versions to allow enthusiastic users to be able to install them while they wait in the queue. They are only discoverable by people who know what they're doing. If that's the best solution, I don't think it's a big deal to require being logged in to be able to install these files.

Decoder met the reporter at HITB and apparently this was intended to be nominated for a bug bounty (though I couldn't find any such mail to our security alias). Fixing that now.
In part this specific example spoof takes advantage of the fact that AMO mixes trusted/reviewed content with untrusted content on the same web and storage servers. Terrible, terrible idea and I've been complaining about it for years (maybe even a decade) so I give up. Signing (starting soon) will at least make the unreviewed stuff not install and break this particular example, but really the word "untrusted" should be in the domain, or path, or not use mozilla.(com/org/net) at all.
Since several client bugs conspire for the rest I'll leave this as a client bug rather than trying to break the chain on the AMO side as we started talking about in the last couple of comments. We probably need to open separate bugs on these because we may need different people to work on them.
1) bypassing the install block is annoying, but by itself not all that serious (sec-low?). We might even have a bug on it already. Without debugging it, my guess is that when the data: page loads the .xpi we're using the data: url as the referrer rather than the origin from the principal. data URLs don't have a host so they look like a file: url, which are allowed to trigger installs. We probably can't change the referrer without breaking lots of stuff so we should check scheme and not just assume based on a null host.
1a) we should check that we're still using the "internal referrer" which we always set because the http header can be stripped entirely in various ways. With the meta-referrer spec that's even easier. The "internal referrer" was something we always set.
2) The heart of this spoof is that the download doorhanger and dialog show up on a page different from the one that spawned it. Coupled with text that says "This site..." rather than the actual origin adds to the spoofing. We should kill the download/install if the progress events are coming back to a different document than the one that launched it -- can't think of a good reason for a legit page to navigate right away, and they can use the callback function to navigate after if they want to. And even if there is a good reason, we're not going to be able to come up with UI that is spoof-proof. Users are ALWAYS going to assume it's the new page doing whatever the doorhanger says.
2a) this really applies to most door-hangers
2b) do we allow non-same-origin frames to trigger an install? If so we have the same spoofing problem if there's an injected or otherwise hostile frame (ad server?). There are several other permission type things in the product where we don't even allow a non-same-origin to request the permission because it's too easy to confuse the user as to whom is asking, and we should think about that for installs.
3) Part of this spoof relies on the ability to make the one thing users can check--the URL in the install dialog--be the expected host (AMO) even though it's untrusted content. That much could be fixed on the AMO side by moving the untrusted content. But the NEW UI doesn't ever show this URL. The name from the signed install.rdf is shown which helps a bit (assuming we won't sign a dupe name) but even then we allow names that are similar to other names and that's probably good enough for a spoof. Worse, the installing site could \_tell\_ you its installing GoodAddon from AMO, but it's actually installing an old copy of GoodAddon (with known vulns) from its own site. You would have no idea.
Sure, lots of people wouldn't know where GoodAddon is supposed to be loaded from, but showing the URL of the install package will give savvier users a chance to catch something scammy and report it, helping us to protect all users. If we can't show the URL in the doorhanger can we at least show it on hovering over the name, or make the name a link to the URL that the user can use the context menu to copy?
I'm raising the severity because given the new UI there's no longer the URL shown to help users figure out they've been spoofed, "the site showing the doorhanger" is the security check and that will be green-lock-secure AMO.Component: Security → Add-ons ManagerFlags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → Toolkit

This looks more necko related. The code here isn't getting a referrer for the request (both branches get a null referer) so we assume it was user-entered. Maybe jduell can recommend someone to look.
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/amContentHandler.js#46>
That said when add-on signing requirements are enabled we'll refuse to install these unlisted add-ons because they won't be signed so I think we should downgrade the severity of this at that point.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend) → needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)

The sec-high rating here (from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1042699#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Addon bypass dialog and spoof vulnerability")) is about the new addon UI not providing the URL of the addon any more. AFAICT that's an addon code fix, not necko.
Bypassing the install block (which is the thing the blank referrer currently enables one to do) is rated as sec-low (which is lower than I would have expected, but I'll defer to dveditz).
Note: my read of the meta-referrer support we landed early this year is that this feature now allows any arbitrary HTML page to suppress the referer header, and so we don't even need the data redirect trick to force an addon install without the user seeing the block. Is that right? Or is the addon check using the internal referrer (aka Docshell QI'd to a propertyBag("docshell.internalReferrer”), so this isn't an issue?
I'm not familiar with how "docshell.internalReferrer” gets set, so if we do want to fix the data:// redirect issue, we'll have to look into how it gets set and why it doesn't happen in that case.Flags: needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)

We use docshell.internalReferrer but it isn't getting set here. The load here is a data: url loaded from a Location: header sent by a http request. The data: document includes a <script> that sets window.location.href.
In this case we end up here and principalURI is apparently a null principal so the loadinfo referrer never gets set.

Well, sites can't get the callback unless they are whitelisted so if they want to show some post-install page they pretty much have to do it immediately after triggering the install.

We took the URL out of the UI because we decided it generally wasn't useful information to the user, more useful was the installing origin, which does show up for http sites but not for data or in this case where we don't know it. As you say the URL is indistinguishable from a regular add-on's URL so I don't think adding the URL back helps us much here.
I think the right fix is to not drop install requests on the floor if they come from somewhere other than the top-level origin and then [bug 1147812](/show_bug.cgi?id=1147812 "NEW - Cancel add-on installations when the associated tab navigates to a new site") to cancel ongoing installs. We probably need the docshell referrer info to be available to do that.

To be clear regardless of the referrer the user is always asked if they want to install an add-on. We use the referrer to tell us if a site is allowed to start the download automatically or if the user has to even confirm at that point. If there is a better way from a content handler to get to the origin that triggered the request that that would be great.

I think the problem here is the data URI. If I'm not mistaken, with a URI such as 'data:text/html,<script> window.location.href = "<https://addons.mozilla.org>" </script>' we don't get referrer headers, because it's different than clicking on a link or a redirect. It just sets the location, which makes it more similar to the user writing the URL in the URL bar.

We should probably get rid of this exception, since there is no difference between JavaScript using document.location to navigate to another page, and the user pasting in a URL.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

There is a difference as far as the user is concerned. In one case the user explicitely performed an action, in the other the website did it possible automatically.
The whitelist is intended to stop websites from being able to automatically spam the user with add-on install requests.

Dave said we use the referrer to tell us if a site is allowed to start the download automatically. We want to allow the download to start automatically when the user has typed in or pasted in the url, but not when script within a page has changed document.location.
I'm not sure this is possible. In loadinfo, we have a loadingPrincipal and a triggeringPrincipal. In bug [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") we are going to change the way we set those principals for top level loads. Given the proposal outlined there, the triggeringPrincipal (which is essentially equivalent to the referrer) will not be null when a user types in a url but instead will be the codebase principal from the url the user typed. For now, we are only fixing the loading/triggeringPrincipals. But eventually we will try and fold the referrer logic into triggeringPrincipal, in which case checking for a null referrer will not work.
Perhaps we need to rework the proposal in [bug 1105556](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") to cover this case and have a slightly different triggeringPrincipal (or flag set on loadinfo) when a user types in a url for a top level load.
Is there another way to determine that the load was initiated by the user outside of using referrer/loadInfo/triggeringPrincipals?Flags: needinfo?(tanvi)

I think this could probably be done in nsLocation::CheckURL()
I don't think we can use the referrer for it, but it might be OK to pass along the triggeringPrincipal, and fix this for data URI redirects ( I don't know that code well enough to do it myself )
I haven't checked, but HTML meta http-equiv="refresh" might also suffer from the same problem.Assignee: valentin.gosu → nobody

Ollie,
Do you know someone who could make the changes in dom/nsLocation for this? Talking to Valentin, it sounds like passsing in the triggeringPrincipal is easy enough, but he's worried about whether we'd be changing some of the assumptions about window.location, so we should have someone who knows that code well.Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

The current setup is broken from a security perspective. We shouldn't rely on ambient authority as we'll keep patching holes. Referrers are interesting for analysis, but not security decisions.
We should definitely have follow up bugs to fix AMO per [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1042699#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Addon bypass dialog and spoof vulnerability").
Also, if we want to pursue this referrer madness, I think we want a follow up bug there too to make sure it gets standardized, otherwise Servo sure is out of luck. And are we sure all the other ways to programmatically navigate are covered? E.g.,
data:text/html,<a href=...></a><script>document.links[0].click()</script>
data:text/html,<form action=...></form><script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
data:text/html,<meta http-equiv=refresh content=0;url=...>
Soon you can navigate a window through a service worker too...

I tend to think we should just ask permission even if you navigate directly to an XPI. Social media has seen its share of attacks using "bookmarklets". I don't see why that would not be similarly abused for this. "Use Firefox? Copy this URL into your address bar to change the Facebook logo into a kitten!"

The "allow" doorhanger is mainly designed to make it impossible for a website to spam a user with add-on install requests. AMO is the only site that can bypass it by default, that and user interaction (except here we can't tell it wasn't user interaction). Regardless of whether we show the allow doorhanger users still have to approve the installation so it isn't directly abusable to skip this doorhanger for that case

If we need a fix for this quickly, could we just always show the doorhanger? It doesn't seem like an intolerable UX experience for people who directly paste in a URI. This seems like a lot of security hole-age for a small amount of UX win.

There are two key parts here. The worse one would not be addressed by your proposal and that's showing the doorhanger(s) on a different site after a navigation. Even in a legit http site to http site transition that's spoofy.
But yes, the other part is we're doing a lot of work to support developers being able to type in .XPI URLs into the URL bar. Always showing a (different) prompt would be one fix. That is, it shouldn't say "This site" is doing anything! It should say something that means "You appear to be manually installing an add-on, is that what you wanted to do?"
Another option I proposed on a mail thread was kill that feature. It's super obscure and only legitimately used by developers. Useful, but dangerous if non-devs get tricked into it. So stop it: if we can't get an internal referrer then we drop the install on the floor. We may find some legit case we break and can fix bugs later, but we're intentionally removing the feature that lets people type in .XPI urls.
Replacement functionality of a sort already exists -- if developers first download the .xpi they can drag-n-drop the file onto a browser window, or use the "Install from File" menu item on the Addon Manager. (We'd have to make sure those both continue to work, they won't have internal referrers either.)
We could also add a GCLI install command for developers. It'd be the same functionality they're using now, but they'd have to open up the command-line first (Shift-F2) and prefix the URL with a command like "install" or "addon".
Not directly implicated in this bug's testcase, but we should also prevent non-same-origin frames from triggering an install. Yes, the domain at the top of the prompt will be different but users are just going to see "This Site" and miss those fine details. The top level site might have put the iframe there, or the iframe could have been injected or maliciously navigated. We also might want this block to apply only to the pre-install permission prompt, and let whitelisted domains (AMO, marketplace) trigger an install itself.

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=8650158&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8650158&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1042699&attachment=8650158)

This implements the main fixes discussed in the email. I did end up using the triggering principal instead of the internal referrer since it made things easier in the end.
\* Non-same-origin frames are denied the ability to initiate installs.
\* Installs triggered by the system principal are still allowed, it turns out that dragging a url or XPI into the content area does this so that keeps working. I've only tested that on OSX though, drag and drop is fickle so it might be broken on other platforms.
\* Installs triggered by a moznull principal are denied, the spoof testcase here and entering an XPI url into the address bar fall into that category. It seems to me that we could make entering a url into the address bar use the system principle which would mean we could keep that working, I didn't bother trying that though as I have no idea about the implications.
\* If the browser navigates to a new origin any pending installs are immediately cancelled and there is code there to make the doorhangers and install prompts hide themselves in that case.
The browser\_navigateaway3 test I added seems to be racy. I'm pretty sure it is a test problem so shouldn't need to hold review while I try to fix that. Worst case we can probably disable that test in the cases where it is failing.
I've kept API changes to a minimum, the AddonManager APIs that were public of sorts still accept an nsIURI and convert to a principal that will behave as things used to. I don't expect many will be using this but wanted to keep it compatible for the uplift, we can drop the API support on trunk.
A number of tests that call browser.loadURI with a direct link to an XPI (which ends up using the system principal) had to be altered to load some page first, this is because in e10s browser.contentPrincipal is undefined until a page load has happened.
When we block the user entering a url in the address bar I think we need to show some UI or it will be confusing. For now this patch just shows the standard blocked message (<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.properties#22>) but without the allow button. Ideally we'd get a new string but I'm assuming that would be hard for uplifts. It also shows for this spoofing case which isn't ideal. It also shows the cross-origin install attempts right now but we can turn that off if we want.

Is this the only edge case? What if some page frames about:home and there's a snippet trying to launch an install? Not sure that could actually happen, but there might be other weird combos.
Would it be a better test to see if the URI has a host instead? Maybe not, I think blob: urls have hosts now, although if your frame was loaded from a blob: presumably the \_principal\_ would be your origin and not the literal blob: (just as the moz-nullprincipal: is not the actual URL in the frame, it's the principal).
I guess the odd schemes will mostly only come up for add-ons or internal functionality--like if the PDF viewer tries to launch installs (unlikely!). moz-nullprincipal can come up commonly in web content in sandboxed iframes.

Most of these appear flush left like the old NetUtil.newURI() calls but three of them are argument-aligned. (I don't feel strongly, just wanted to point it out in case you did and it was a mistake.)

Doesn't this test now test the opposite? Does this un-fix the above two bugs (or at least 473060)? It may be what we have to do but if so we should change the rest of the comment.
Or, do we consider them still fixed because it's canceled cleanly, not with the errors (or crash) described in those bugs?

Since this is installing an unsigned package, how can you test whether the install fails because it was cross-origin or because it was unsigned? I see the install\_blocked() event handler but it's not saving or checking anything. Would it throw an unsigned error (if it got that far) because there's no handler defined for that one?

Looks like PopupNotifications already handles the case where the uri has no valid host so I just removed this check.

Added a check that the install\_blocked handler is called. We should also be covered because signing requirements are disabled in these tests and we have other checks that installing the same file works normally.

I haven't looked at this patch closely - are you concerned that your changes will break Fennec in some way, or are you worried that we'll need additional patches to also fix this issue on Fennec?
Is there something I can do to test if this is a problem on Fennec? I'm also happy to write a patch if we need to update our notification UI as well.Flags: needinfo?(margaret.leibovic) → needinfo?(dtownsend)

The specific part I was talking about is that if the user navigates to a new site from the tab that started an extension install the install will be cancelled. I don't really remember what Fennec's install UI looks like so I'm not sure if that is a problem or not.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend) → needinfo?(margaret.leibovic)

ESR patch
Forgot that there is one difference here. The string displayed when we block is different on ESR and attempts to include the hostname blocked, but in many cases we don't have one so we get a weird popup like this:
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/anc5c3tdzasybk2/Screenshot%202015-08-25%2012.49.34.png?dl=0>
Changing that would mean a string change and I don't know how feasible that is.

I'm a little bit worried about the use of triggeringPrincipal.
Since I'm not too familiar with this area, I'll first summarize the behavior as I understand it.
\* If you are on a whitelisted site, the user needs to go through one dialog when they try and install and addon.
\* If a user tries to install an addon from a non-whitelisted site, they will get 2 dialogs (one before the actual download and one after)
\* If a user uses the addons manager to download an addon, there is no top level domain to check against the whitelist. So they check if the triggeringPrincipal is systemPrincipal.
\* If a user tries to install an addon in any other way (copy/paste a url, data: uri, etc) it should fail.
The problem is that the triggeringPrincipal for top level loads could be system for other reasons. Examples:
1) When opening a new blank tab
\* loadingPrincipal is systemPrincipal - comes from mScriptGlobal->GetFrameElementInternal
\* triggeringPrincipal is set to systemPrincipal (no aOwner)
2) When launching a bookmark OR refreshing a page.
\* loadingPrincipal is systemPrincipal - comes from mScriptGlobal->GetFrameElementInternal
\* triggeringPrincipal is set to systemPrincipal (no aOwner)
See [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") and <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/docShellPrincipals>.
I want to change the value of triggerPrincipal for top level loads as described here [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell"), but in the meantime there may still be attack vectors.
When using the addons manager, is the referrer null? Is there any other way to tell that this is where the load came from?

No, the add-ons manager bypasses the code that handles installs from web pages.

Dragging the XPI file or the url to one into the browser should still work.

This would never cause an XPI install though right?

That's surprising, so if the user bookmarked an url or refreshed a page that later changed to serving an XPI then it would bypass the whitelist. That's not great though I suspect that that might have been the case before the fix for this bug (the bookmark case for sure, I'm not sure what docshell.internalReferrer did on reloads).

When using the add-ons manager we install using a different path, the triggering principal is not checked in this case.

If we aren't checking triggeringPrincipal = systemPrincipal to preserve the behavior of add-ons manager, then what are we using that check for? What use case does it support?

It preserves drag and drop of an XPI file into the browser. I was also hoping it might be a way to get the url bar method working again sometime in the future.

Also to be clear we never check that the triggeringPrincipal is a system principal in particular, we just check that the triggeringPrincipal subsumes the principal of the document loaded in the tab that started the install.
In the case of the url bar entered install and the poc for this bug the triggering principal is a null principal so that test fails. For drag and drop it is the system principal and so passes. For any same-origin frame in the tab that test passes too.

This occurs when a resize event is triggered in concert with style changes but the canvas references have been recreated in the meantime, destroying the originally referenced context. This results in an exploitable crash.  Ucha Gobejishvili, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative, subsequently reported this same issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1257278#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-08-26 15:54:46 UTC  ``` Security researcher Bas Venis reported a mechanism where add-ons could be installed from a different source than user expectations. Normally, when a user enters the URL to an add-on directly in the addressbar, warning prompts are bypassed because it is the result of direct user action. He discovered that a data: URL could be manipulated on a loaded page to simulate this direct user input of the add-on's URL, which would result in a bypassing of the install permission prompt. He also reported that in the absence of the permission prompt, it is possible to cause the actual installation prompt to appear above another site's location by causing a page navigation immediately after triggering add-on installation. This could manipulate a user into falsely believing a trusted site (such as addons.mozilla.org) has initiated the installation. This could lead to users installing an add-on from a malicious source.   External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2015/mfsa2015-95.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Bas Venis as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1257278#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-27 21:18:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2015:1693 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1693.html>   ``` |  |

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8460893&action=edit)

Normally Firefox warns the user when trying to install add-on if this was page-initiated.
When the page is redirecting or navigating by <a href link, JavaScript or server redirect, Firefox trows the
'Firefox prevented this site (site.com) from asking you to install software on your computer.' warning at the user, which needs to explicitly be accepted for the add-on to continue installing.
There is however, a simple vulnerability that lets an attacker bypass this dialog, which allows a rather nasty attack on the user.
Basically, there is one exception in which the dialog will not be shown, which is if the user pastes or copies the direct link/URL in the URL bar.
Now the user could just click on links, redirects etc that lead to this page, because a data uri redirected to the page which itself redirects with a 'page moved header' to the location of the add-on, will disrupt that 'chain' and installation of the add-on will start without the dialog. As if the user typed it in directly.
This behavior in combination with a properly timed attack will result in a scenario where the user will download the add-on controlled by the attacker, the legit add-on webpage shown with it. The only thing not correct is the url of the pushed add-on, which the user CANNOT verify. This dialog is really only useful if the download location is from another domain. Since it will only show the <https://addons.mozzila.org/firefox/download/latest/123/randomurl> .. [truncated].
So the attacker will simply upload his unreviewed add-on, with the same name and icon as the desired add-on to be spoofed. Sure, this will eventually be reviewed and picked up or reported in the process. But in the meanwhile the direct link will be used. And since the reputation of the spoofed add-on that is being pushed doesn't matter (user never views that page). There is no way for the user to notice that the add-on is spoofed.
Attached are the files that would be running on the server.
Demonstration of the issue: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTKblGpeW4Y> (unlisted)

That's an intentional exception. The block is more of an anti-annoyance feature so sites can't pester people into giving in and installing (the next dialog is the actual security prompt). It's known that if you can white-wash your referer away you can mimic this, but then you're generally not at the same site so you can't keep annoying the user that way. Acceptable risk unless we see people start to abuse it, basically.
Spoofing people with the AMO origin of unreviewed add-ons, however, is clever.
Wil: would it be possible to require people to be signed into AMO to reach download links for unreviewed add-ons? Or failing that, maybe change the server to reject such links if the referer for the download doesn't come from AMO itself? Either would pretty much eliminate the potential for spoofing here.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(clouserw)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

The youtube video never loads for me and the video in the zip file shows a desktop but flickers so much I can't tell what is going on. So, I can't tell entirely what we're talking about - when you say "unreviewed add-on" are you talking about a preliminarily reviewed add-on? Can you put in specific steps to reproduce this so I can get a better idea of what's going on?
Regarding the questions: It's possible to require people be signed in, but I'm not sure it's something we'd want to do. I think we used to require people be signed in to download add-ons which weren't fully reviewed (when we had the yellow/black stripes on the buttons - it was a long time ago) and we got enough of a negative reaction to it that we stopped doing it. Jorge could probably give more info. We'd also have to ask if that would really change anything about the scenario.
Regarding referrers, that depends what URL is being pasted in. If it's a download link on AMO, potentially we could, but if it's a cached URL directly to the file then probably not. We may also interfere with legitimate 3rd party sites that link to AMO directly on purpose (and add their own src=\_\_\_ to the URL for tracking and such).Flags: needinfo?(clouserw)

As I understand it, the attacker uses some trickery to directly load the URL that points to the XPI file of an unreviewed add-on on AMO. This bypasses the warning that should appear for non-AMO add-ons, and also the warnings we show on AMO for unreviewed add-ons. This would only work while the version is waiting in the queue, which can range from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the add-on and reviewer availability.
Note that this is only about unreviewed add-ons in the queue, not preliminarily approved add-ons. The latter are checked for security issues, just like fully reviewed add-ons.

We expose unreviewed add-ons and versions to allow enthusiastic users to be able to install them while they wait in the queue. They are only discoverable by people who know what they're doing. If that's the best solution, I don't think it's a big deal to require being logged in to be able to install these files.

Decoder met the reporter at HITB and apparently this was intended to be nominated for a bug bounty (though I couldn't find any such mail to our security alias). Fixing that now.
In part this specific example spoof takes advantage of the fact that AMO mixes trusted/reviewed content with untrusted content on the same web and storage servers. Terrible, terrible idea and I've been complaining about it for years (maybe even a decade) so I give up. Signing (starting soon) will at least make the unreviewed stuff not install and break this particular example, but really the word "untrusted" should be in the domain, or path, or not use mozilla.(com/org/net) at all.
Since several client bugs conspire for the rest I'll leave this as a client bug rather than trying to break the chain on the AMO side as we started talking about in the last couple of comments. We probably need to open separate bugs on these because we may need different people to work on them.
1) bypassing the install block is annoying, but by itself not all that serious (sec-low?). We might even have a bug on it already. Without debugging it, my guess is that when the data: page loads the .xpi we're using the data: url as the referrer rather than the origin from the principal. data URLs don't have a host so they look like a file: url, which are allowed to trigger installs. We probably can't change the referrer without breaking lots of stuff so we should check scheme and not just assume based on a null host.
1a) we should check that we're still using the "internal referrer" which we always set because the http header can be stripped entirely in various ways. With the meta-referrer spec that's even easier. The "internal referrer" was something we always set.
2) The heart of this spoof is that the download doorhanger and dialog show up on a page different from the one that spawned it. Coupled with text that says "This site..." rather than the actual origin adds to the spoofing. We should kill the download/install if the progress events are coming back to a different document than the one that launched it -- can't think of a good reason for a legit page to navigate right away, and they can use the callback function to navigate after if they want to. And even if there is a good reason, we're not going to be able to come up with UI that is spoof-proof. Users are ALWAYS going to assume it's the new page doing whatever the doorhanger says.
2a) this really applies to most door-hangers
2b) do we allow non-same-origin frames to trigger an install? If so we have the same spoofing problem if there's an injected or otherwise hostile frame (ad server?). There are several other permission type things in the product where we don't even allow a non-same-origin to request the permission because it's too easy to confuse the user as to whom is asking, and we should think about that for installs.
3) Part of this spoof relies on the ability to make the one thing users can check--the URL in the install dialog--be the expected host (AMO) even though it's untrusted content. That much could be fixed on the AMO side by moving the untrusted content. But the NEW UI doesn't ever show this URL. The name from the signed install.rdf is shown which helps a bit (assuming we won't sign a dupe name) but even then we allow names that are similar to other names and that's probably good enough for a spoof. Worse, the installing site could \_tell\_ you its installing GoodAddon from AMO, but it's actually installing an old copy of GoodAddon (with known vulns) from its own site. You would have no idea.
Sure, lots of people wouldn't know where GoodAddon is supposed to be loaded from, but showing the URL of the install package will give savvier users a chance to catch something scammy and report it, helping us to protect all users. If we can't show the URL in the doorhanger can we at least show it on hovering over the name, or make the name a link to the URL that the user can use the context menu to copy?
I'm raising the severity because given the new UI there's no longer the URL shown to help users figure out they've been spoofed, "the site showing the doorhanger" is the security check and that will be green-lock-secure AMO.Component: Security → Add-ons ManagerFlags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---) → [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → Toolkit

This looks more necko related. The code here isn't getting a referrer for the request (both branches get a null referer) so we assume it was user-entered. Maybe jduell can recommend someone to look.
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/amContentHandler.js#46>
That said when add-on signing requirements are enabled we'll refuse to install these unlisted add-ons because they won't be signed so I think we should downgrade the severity of this at that point.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend) → needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)

The sec-high rating here (from [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1042699#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Addon bypass dialog and spoof vulnerability")) is about the new addon UI not providing the URL of the addon any more. AFAICT that's an addon code fix, not necko.
Bypassing the install block (which is the thing the blank referrer currently enables one to do) is rated as sec-low (which is lower than I would have expected, but I'll defer to dveditz).
Note: my read of the meta-referrer support we landed early this year is that this feature now allows any arbitrary HTML page to suppress the referer header, and so we don't even need the data redirect trick to force an addon install without the user seeing the block. Is that right? Or is the addon check using the internal referrer (aka Docshell QI'd to a propertyBag("docshell.internalReferrer”), so this isn't an issue?
I'm not familiar with how "docshell.internalReferrer” gets set, so if we do want to fix the data:// redirect issue, we'll have to look into how it gets set and why it doesn't happen in that case.Flags: needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)

We use docshell.internalReferrer but it isn't getting set here. The load here is a data: url loaded from a Location: header sent by a http request. The data: document includes a <script> that sets window.location.href.
In this case we end up here and principalURI is apparently a null principal so the loadinfo referrer never gets set.

Well, sites can't get the callback unless they are whitelisted so if they want to show some post-install page they pretty much have to do it immediately after triggering the install.

We took the URL out of the UI because we decided it generally wasn't useful information to the user, more useful was the installing origin, which does show up for http sites but not for data or in this case where we don't know it. As you say the URL is indistinguishable from a regular add-on's URL so I don't think adding the URL back helps us much here.
I think the right fix is to not drop install requests on the floor if they come from somewhere other than the top-level origin and then [bug 1147812](/show_bug.cgi?id=1147812 "NEW - Cancel add-on installations when the associated tab navigates to a new site") to cancel ongoing installs. We probably need the docshell referrer info to be available to do that.

To be clear regardless of the referrer the user is always asked if they want to install an add-on. We use the referrer to tell us if a site is allowed to start the download automatically or if the user has to even confirm at that point. If there is a better way from a content handler to get to the origin that triggered the request that that would be great.

I think the problem here is the data URI. If I'm not mistaken, with a URI such as 'data:text/html,<script> window.location.href = "<https://addons.mozilla.org>" </script>' we don't get referrer headers, because it's different than clicking on a link or a redirect. It just sets the location, which makes it more similar to the user writing the URL in the URL bar.

We should probably get rid of this exception, since there is no difference between JavaScript using document.location to navigate to another page, and the user pasting in a URL.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

There is a difference as far as the user is concerned. In one case the user explicitely performed an action, in the other the website did it possible automatically.
The whitelist is intended to stop websites from being able to automatically spam the user with add-on install requests.

Dave said we use the referrer to tell us if a site is allowed to start the download automatically. We want to allow the download to start automatically when the user has typed in or pasted in the url, but not when script within a page has changed document.location.
I'm not sure this is possible. In loadinfo, we have a loadingPrincipal and a triggeringPrincipal. In bug [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") we are going to change the way we set those principals for top level loads. Given the proposal outlined there, the triggeringPrincipal (which is essentially equivalent to the referrer) will not be null when a user types in a url but instead will be the codebase principal from the url the user typed. For now, we are only fixing the loading/triggeringPrincipals. But eventually we will try and fold the referrer logic into triggeringPrincipal, in which case checking for a null referrer will not work.
Perhaps we need to rework the proposal in [bug 1105556](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") to cover this case and have a slightly different triggeringPrincipal (or flag set on loadinfo) when a user types in a url for a top level load.
Is there another way to determine that the load was initiated by the user outside of using referrer/loadInfo/triggeringPrincipals?Flags: needinfo?(tanvi)

I think this could probably be done in nsLocation::CheckURL()
I don't think we can use the referrer for it, but it might be OK to pass along the triggeringPrincipal, and fix this for data URI redirects ( I don't know that code well enough to do it myself )
I haven't checked, but HTML meta http-equiv="refresh" might also suffer from the same problem.Assignee: valentin.gosu → nobody

Ollie,
Do you know someone who could make the changes in dom/nsLocation for this? Talking to Valentin, it sounds like passsing in the triggeringPrincipal is easy enough, but he's worried about whether we'd be changing some of the assumptions about window.location, so we should have someone who knows that code well.Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

The current setup is broken from a security perspective. We shouldn't rely on ambient authority as we'll keep patching holes. Referrers are interesting for analysis, but not security decisions.
We should definitely have follow up bugs to fix AMO per [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1042699#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox Addon bypass dialog and spoof vulnerability").
Also, if we want to pursue this referrer madness, I think we want a follow up bug there too to make sure it gets standardized, otherwise Servo sure is out of luck. And are we sure all the other ways to programmatically navigate are covered? E.g.,
data:text/html,<a href=...></a><script>document.links[0].click()</script>
data:text/html,<form action=...></form><script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>
data:text/html,<meta http-equiv=refresh content=0;url=...>
Soon you can navigate a window through a service worker too...

I tend to think we should just ask permission even if you navigate directly to an XPI. Social media has seen its share of attacks using "bookmarklets". I don't see why that would not be similarly abused for this. "Use Firefox? Copy this URL into your address bar to change the Facebook logo into a kitten!"

The "allow" doorhanger is mainly designed to make it impossible for a website to spam a user with add-on install requests. AMO is the only site that can bypass it by default, that and user interaction (except here we can't tell it wasn't user interaction). Regardless of whether we show the allow doorhanger users still have to approve the installation so it isn't directly abusable to skip this doorhanger for that case

If we need a fix for this quickly, could we just always show the doorhanger? It doesn't seem like an intolerable UX experience for people who directly paste in a URI. This seems like a lot of security hole-age for a small amount of UX win.

There are two key parts here. The worse one would not be addressed by your proposal and that's showing the doorhanger(s) on a different site after a navigation. Even in a legit http site to http site transition that's spoofy.
But yes, the other part is we're doing a lot of work to support developers being able to type in .XPI URLs into the URL bar. Always showing a (different) prompt would be one fix. That is, it shouldn't say "This site" is doing anything! It should say something that means "You appear to be manually installing an add-on, is that what you wanted to do?"
Another option I proposed on a mail thread was kill that feature. It's super obscure and only legitimately used by developers. Useful, but dangerous if non-devs get tricked into it. So stop it: if we can't get an internal referrer then we drop the install on the floor. We may find some legit case we break and can fix bugs later, but we're intentionally removing the feature that lets people type in .XPI urls.
Replacement functionality of a sort already exists -- if developers first download the .xpi they can drag-n-drop the file onto a browser window, or use the "Install from File" menu item on the Addon Manager. (We'd have to make sure those both continue to work, they won't have internal referrers either.)
We could also add a GCLI install command for developers. It'd be the same functionality they're using now, but they'd have to open up the command-line first (Shift-F2) and prefix the URL with a command like "install" or "addon".
Not directly implicated in this bug's testcase, but we should also prevent non-same-origin frames from triggering an install. Yes, the domain at the top of the prompt will be different but users are just going to see "This Site" and miss those fine details. The top level site might have put the iframe there, or the iframe could have been injected or maliciously navigated. We also might want this block to apply only to the pre-install permission prompt, and let whitelisted domains (AMO, marketplace) trigger an install itself.

It appears that Mossop will be working on a solution that has been discussed in an email thread, so I'm giving the bug to him.
We should definitely file a followup bug on switching to triggeringPrincipal and fixing nsLocation to pass through the triggering principal correctly.

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=8650158&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8650158&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1042699&attachment=8650158)

This implements the main fixes discussed in the email. I did end up using the triggering principal instead of the internal referrer since it made things easier in the end.
\* Non-same-origin frames are denied the ability to initiate installs.
\* Installs triggered by the system principal are still allowed, it turns out that dragging a url or XPI into the content area does this so that keeps working. I've only tested that on OSX though, drag and drop is fickle so it might be broken on other platforms.
\* Installs triggered by a moznull principal are denied, the spoof testcase here and entering an XPI url into the address bar fall into that category. It seems to me that we could make entering a url into the address bar use the system principle which would mean we could keep that working, I didn't bother trying that though as I have no idea about the implications.
\* If the browser navigates to a new origin any pending installs are immediately cancelled and there is code there to make the doorhangers and install prompts hide themselves in that case.
The browser\_navigateaway3 test I added seems to be racy. I'm pretty sure it is a test problem so shouldn't need to hold review while I try to fix that. Worst case we can probably disable that test in the cases where it is failing.
I've kept API changes to a minimum, the AddonManager APIs that were public of sorts still accept an nsIURI and convert to a principal that will behave as things used to. I don't expect many will be using this but wanted to keep it compatible for the uplift, we can drop the API support on trunk.
A number of tests that call browser.loadURI with a direct link to an XPI (which ends up using the system principal) had to be altered to load some page first, this is because in e10s browser.contentPrincipal is undefined until a page load has happened.
When we block the user entering a url in the address bar I think we need to show some UI or it will be confusing. For now this patch just shows the standard blocked message (<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.properties#22>) but without the allow button. Ideally we'd get a new string but I'm assuming that would be hard for uplifts. It also shows for this spoofing case which isn't ideal. It also shows the cross-origin install attempts right now but we can turn that off if we want.

Is this the only edge case? What if some page frames about:home and there's a snippet trying to launch an install? Not sure that could actually happen, but there might be other weird combos.
Would it be a better test to see if the URI has a host instead? Maybe not, I think blob: urls have hosts now, although if your frame was loaded from a blob: presumably the \_principal\_ would be your origin and not the literal blob: (just as the moz-nullprincipal: is not the actual URL in the frame, it's the principal).
I guess the odd schemes will mostly only come up for add-ons or internal functionality--like if the PDF viewer tries to launch installs (unlikely!). moz-nullprincipal can come up commonly in web content in sandboxed iframes.

Most of these appear flush left like the old NetUtil.newURI() calls but three of them are argument-aligned. (I don't feel strongly, just wanted to point it out in case you did and it was a mistake.)

Since this is installing an unsigned package, how can you test whether the install fails because it was cross-origin or because it was unsigned? I see the install\_blocked() event handler but it's not saving or checking anything. Would it throw an unsigned error (if it got that far) because there's no handler defined for that one?

Looks like PopupNotifications already handles the case where the uri has no valid host so I just removed this check.

Added a check that the install\_blocked handler is called. We should also be covered because signing requirements are disabled in these tests and we have other checks that installing the same file works normally.

I haven't looked at this patch closely - are you concerned that your changes will break Fennec in some way, or are you worried that we'll need additional patches to also fix this issue on Fennec?
Is there something I can do to test if this is a problem on Fennec? I'm also happy to write a patch if we need to update our notification UI as well.Flags: needinfo?(margaret.leibovic) → needinfo?(dtownsend)

The specific part I was talking about is that if the user navigates to a new site from the tab that started an extension install the install will be cancelled. I don't really remember what Fennec's install UI looks like so I'm not sure if that is a problem or not.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend) → needinfo?(margaret.leibovic)

Yes, ESR 31 is affected. The ESR38 patch, or something close to it, might work on 31.

ESR patch
Forgot that there is one difference here. The string displayed when we block is different on ESR and attempts to include the hostname blocked, but in many cases we don't have one so we get a weird popup like this:
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/anc5c3tdzasybk2/Screenshot%202015-08-25%2012.49.34.png?dl=0>
Changing that would mean a string change and I don't know how feasible that is.

I'm a little bit worried about the use of triggeringPrincipal.
Since I'm not too familiar with this area, I'll first summarize the behavior as I understand it.
\* If you are on a whitelisted site, the user needs to go through one dialog when they try and install and addon.
\* If a user tries to install an addon from a non-whitelisted site, they will get 2 dialogs (one before the actual download and one after)
\* If a user uses the addons manager to download an addon, there is no top level domain to check against the whitelist. So they check if the triggeringPrincipal is systemPrincipal.
\* If a user tries to install an addon in any other way (copy/paste a url, data: uri, etc) it should fail.
The problem is that the triggeringPrincipal for top level loads could be system for other reasons. Examples:
1) When opening a new blank tab
\* loadingPrincipal is systemPrincipal - comes from mScriptGlobal->GetFrameElementInternal
\* triggeringPrincipal is set to systemPrincipal (no aOwner)
2) When launching a bookmark OR refreshing a page.
\* loadingPrincipal is systemPrincipal - comes from mScriptGlobal->GetFrameElementInternal
\* triggeringPrincipal is set to systemPrincipal (no aOwner)
See [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell") and <https://etherpad.mozilla.org/docShellPrincipals>.
I want to change the value of triggerPrincipal for top level loads as described here [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1105556#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set correct loadingPrincipal and loadingNode in docshell"), but in the meantime there may still be attack vectors.
When using the addons manager, is the referrer null? Is there any other way to tell that this is where the load came from?

No, the add-ons manager bypasses the code that handles installs from web pages.

Dragging the XPI file or the url to one into the browser should still work.

This would never cause an XPI install though right?

That's surprising, so if the user bookmarked an url or refreshed a page that later changed to serving an XPI then it would bypass the whitelist. That's not great though I suspect that that might have been the case before the fix for this bug (the bookmark case for sure, I'm not sure what docshell.internalReferrer did on reloads).

When using the add-ons manager we install using a different path, the triggering principal is not checked in this case.

If we aren't checking triggeringPrincipal = systemPrincipal to preserve the behavior of add-ons manager, then what are we using that check for? What use case does it support?

It preserves drag and drop of an XPI file into the browser. I was also hoping it might be a way to get the url bar method working again sometime in the future.

Also to be clear we never check that the triggeringPrincipal is a system principal in particular, we just check that the triggeringPrincipal subsumes the principal of the document loaded in the tab that started the install.
In the case of the url bar entered install and the poc for this bug the triggering principal is a null principal so that test fails. For drag and drop it is the system principal and so passes. For any same-origin frame in the tab that test passes too.

Package        : iceweasel
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-4497 CVE-2015-4498

Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-4497

    Jean-Max Reymond and Ucha Gobejishvili discovered a use-after-free
    vulnerability which occurs when resizing of a canvas element is
    triggered in concert with style changes. A web page containing
    malicious content can cause Iceweasel to crash, or potentially,
    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
    Iceweasel.

CVE-2015-4498

    Bas Venis reported a flaw in the handling of add-ons installation. A
    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to bypass the add-on
    installation prompt and trick a user into installing an add-on from
    a malicious source.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.2.1esr-1~deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.1esr-1~deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.1esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

# Security Advisories for Firefox ESR

### Impact key

* Critical
  Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
  software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
* High
  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)
