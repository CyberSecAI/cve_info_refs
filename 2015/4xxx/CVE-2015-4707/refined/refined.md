Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-4707:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stemmed from how IPython's REST API handled JSON error responses, specifically on the `/api/notebooks` path.
- The server was incorrectly setting the `Content-Type` header to `text/html` instead of `application/json` for error responses.
- These error messages included URL parameters, which could contain malicious code, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue was the potential for XSS. By manipulating URL parameters, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the error messages, which would then be executed in the victim's browser due to the incorrect `Content-Type` header.
- **Incorrect Content-Type Header:** The server's failure to set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` allowed the browser to interpret the error messages as HTML, enabling the execution of injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session, which could allow for a number of malicious activities.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal session cookies or other sensitive data.
- **Redirects:** The attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate the user interface, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript by crafting URLs with malicious parameters, which are then reflected in the JSON error message.
- **Targeted API Request**:  By crafting a malicious request to the `/api/notebooks` endpoint which leads to an error, the attacker can trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to send a crafted request**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the IPython server with malicious URL parameters.
-   **Awareness of vulnerable API endpoint**:  The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint `/api/notebooks` and how to trigger an error response.
-   **No special access required**: The attacker does not need to be logged in, or have access to the server.
