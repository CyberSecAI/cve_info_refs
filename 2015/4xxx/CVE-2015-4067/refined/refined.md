{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the libnv6 module of Dell NetVault Backup. By manipulating a serialized object's template string specifiers, an attacker can cause an integer overflow leading to an undersized allocation, which then results in a heap overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without authentication by manipulating a serialized object's template string specifiers.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted serialized objects to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required."
