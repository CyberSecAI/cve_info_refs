Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-4510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A race condition exists in the `WorkerPrivate::NotifyFeatures` function within Mozilla Firefox. This occurs when a shared worker interacts with IndexedDB. The race condition leads to a use-after-free scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free, meaning a piece of memory is accessed after it has been freed. In this case, the `WorkerPrivate::NotifyFeatures` function tries to access memory related to a worker after that worker has been deallocated or is in the process of deallocation
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between a shared worker and IndexedDB. The race condition occurs due to improper interaction between the shared worker and IndexedDB implementation

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. This is because the use-after-free can be manipulated to overwrite parts of memory to gain control of program execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition, causing the application to crash. The use-after-free can cause a crash when the freed memory is accessed, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through a crafted website. An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that exploits the race condition when Firefox loads the webpage..
*   **Web Content:** The exploit is triggered through a crafted web content that utilizes shared workers and IndexedDB in a specific way to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker needs the capability to host malicious content on a web server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** An attacker needs some level of knowledge of the code to craft an exploit. While not easy, the vulnerability details and affected code can be used to construct an exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Suse content indicates the vulnerability is rated as having "moderate" severity by them.
*   The provided Mozilla content also states the bug as "critical"
*   Multiple sources mention this vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 41
*   Multiple sources also state that this vulnerability could be triggered on Linux and Windows
*   The patch involves preventing use of memory after free. The primary fix involved using a "control" runnable for cleanup instead of a "regular" runnable to ensure resources are released on the correct thread.
