# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2015-013: Arbitrary Code Execution in extension Job Fair (jobfair)

It has been discovered that the extension "Job Fair" (jobfair) is susceptible to Arbitrary Code Execution

**Release Date:** June 15, 2015

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** version 1.0.0 and below

**Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**CVE:** not assigned yet

**Problem Description:** The extension jobfair offers the possibility to upload files. It was discovered that it was possible to upload files with specially crafted file extensions, which could be executed as PHP files on the server when using Apache as web server with mod\_mime available (default). An uploaded file is stored in the extension upload folder and can be executed afterwards. Failing to check the uploaded file name against the fileDenyPattern pattern, jobfair is susceptible to arbitrary code execution.

Please also read an [older bulletin](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-20080611-1/) and a [blog article](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/advice-on-core-security-issue-regarding-filedenypattern/) for further information about this issue in combination with Apache as web server.

**Solution:** An updated version 1.0.1 is available from the TYPO3 Extension Manager and at [http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/jobfair/1.0.1/t3x/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/jobfair/1.0.1/t3x/ "Opens external link in new window"). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

**Credits:** Credits go to Torben Hansen who discovered and reported the issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
