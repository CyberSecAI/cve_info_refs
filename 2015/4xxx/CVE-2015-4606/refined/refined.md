Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The "Job Fair" (jobfair) TYPO3 extension allowed the upload of files with arbitrary extensions.
- It failed to check uploaded file names against a defined fileDenyPattern.
- This allowed execution of files with specially crafted file extensions as PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The extension did not properly validate or restrict file extensions during the upload process.
- **Insufficient File Name Validation:** The extension did not enforce the fileDenyPattern, which is intended to prevent execution of dangerous file types.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The combination of unrestricted file uploads and a failure to prevent execution of arbitrary file extensions (specifically PHP) led to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the TYPO3 instance, potentially gaining complete control over the web server and underlying system.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is exploited through the file upload functionality provided by the "Job Fair" extension.
- **Crafted File Extension:** The attacker uploads a file with an extension that can be interpreted and executed as PHP code by the webserver (e.g., .php, .phtml, etc.)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload function of the "Job Fair" extension, which might be available to frontend users.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know that the extension does not properly validate file extensions.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker would need a basic understanding of how web servers and PHP code work in order to craft an effective exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content included a security advisory that describes the issue, and credits the discovery to Torben Hansen.
-  The security advisory also advises users to update to version 1.0.1 of the extension, where the issue has been fixed.
- The advisory also points to general advice regarding the  fileDenyPattern configuration.
- The content highlights that using Apache as web server with mod_mime available is a default setup which makes systems vulnerable if not configured correctly.
- The advisory includes a CVSS v2 score indicating the severity (High).
