**Root cause of vulnerability:** An XML parsing vulnerability exists in PAN-OS due to insufficient validation of user-supplied XML data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user can inject malicious XML data into the web-based device management front-end.
- This allows the user to retrieve arbitrary content from the device.
- The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the web-based management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the PAN-OS device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious XML data to the device.
