### Description

An XML parsing vulnerability exists in PAN-OS allowing a malicious user within PAN-OS to inject malicious XML data into the web-based device management front-end allowing the user to retrieve arbitrary content from the device. The user must be an authenticated user issuing the request. (Ref #71273)

This issue affects the management interface of the device, where an authenticated administrator injects malicious XML data into the web UI interface.

This issue affects PAN-OS 5.0.15 and earlier; PAN-OS 6.0.7 and earlier; PAN-OS 6.1.3 and earlier

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | <= 6.1.3 | >= 6.1.4 |
| PAN-OS 6.0 | <= 6.0.7 | >= 6.0.8 |
| PAN-OS 5.0 | <= 5.0.15 | >= 5.0.16 |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
4.4 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))

### Solution

PAN-OS 5.0.16; PAN-OS 6.0.8; PAN-OS 6.1.4

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the management interface of the device. Security appliance management best practices dictate that the management interface be isolated and strictly limited only to security administration personnel.
