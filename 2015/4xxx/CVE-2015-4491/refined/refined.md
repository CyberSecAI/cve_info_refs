Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2015-4491:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from Red Hat, SUSE, and Mozilla clearly indicates that CVE-2015-4491 is a relevant vulnerability. It is described as a heap overflow in gdk-pixbuf when scaling bitmap images.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

- **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `make_filter_table` function within the `gdk-pixbuf` library when scaling bitmap images, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises due to improper calculation of the size of the filter table, allowing for controlled heap overflow.
  
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Integer overflow when calculating the size of the filter table
  - Heap-based buffer overflow due to the insufficient checks

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Denial of service (application crash)
  - Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. The attacker can control memory to a certain extent by crafting the size of the bitmap.

- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted BMP image file.
  - The vulnerability can be triggered through various applications that use the vulnerable gdk-pixbuf library for image processing, including file pickers in web browsers like Firefox and Chrome.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to have the ability to deliver a specially crafted BMP image to the victim.
  - No authentication is required.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the  `gdk-pixbuf/pixops/pixops.c` file, specifically in the `make_filter_table` and related functions, which handle image scaling operations.
*   The integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of an internal array used for filtering, using dimensions of the image taken directly from the file. The vulnerability can be triggered by setting the dimensions of the image such that `SUBSAMPLE * SUBSAMPLE * n_x * n_y` overflows an integer.
*  The issue can also lead to excessive memory allocation due to a lack of input validation on image dimensions, which can also cause a denial of service.
* The vulnerability was addressed by performing integer overflow checks and adding size limit for preview images.

**Affected Products:**

Based on the information provided, the vulnerability affects:
*   Mozilla Firefox (prior to version 40.0 and ESR prior to 38.2) and related products (Thunderbird and SeaMonkey).
*   Linux systems running Gnome that use the vulnerable version of gdk-pixbuf, also affecting applications like file pickers within firefox.
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise products, including various versions and SPs of SLE Server, Desktop, and related modules
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 and related products.
*   openSUSE Leap and Tumbleweed.

**Mitigations:**

The provided content mentions that the issue was addressed through patches that perform integer overflow checks, as well as imposing a limit on the maximum preview image size.

This information provides a good understanding of CVE-2015-4491, including its technical details, exploitation potential, and the steps taken by vendors to resolve it.
