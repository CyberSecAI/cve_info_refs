    "description": "The nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep function in Mozilla Firefox before 40.0, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2, and Firefox OS before 2.2 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, related to an \"overflow.\"",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "weakness": "Integer overflow in nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep, leading to memory corruption",
        "impact": "Denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly other unspecified impact",
        "attack_vector": "Remote attacker entices user to view a specially crafted web page or email.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted webpage or email. Attacker needs no authentication, and can be on the network.",
         "details": "The `nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep` function, used in Mozilla Firefox, NSPR and other related applications, is vulnerable to an integer overflow. When `aNewLength` is sufficiently large, adding it to `mLength - aCutLength` could cause an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller than expected `newTotalLen`. Subsequent code may use the incorrect `newTotalLen` leading to a memory corruption, potentially resulting in a crash or further exploitaton."
