Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `xzgrep` utility, specifically version 4.999.9beta, incorrectly processes filenames containing a semicolon (;). This is due to how the script parses the filename, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of filenames. When `xzgrep` encounters a semicolon in a filename, it interprets the part after the semicolon as a separate command to execute in the shell context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the user running `xzgrep`. This can result in a variety of impacts, including data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** With careful crafting of the filename, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges, for instance, by creating a SUID root bash shell in /var/tmp.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Filenames:** The attack vector involves creating a file with a malicious filename containing a semicolon followed by a command (e.g., `/tmp/semi;command`).
- **Local Exploitation:** The attacker needs local access to the system. They need to convince a user to run xzgrep on a file with a crafted filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have an account on the target system and needs to be able to create files on the file system where xzgrep will be used.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to persuade a user to run the vulnerable `xzgrep` command on the specially crafted file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `xzgrep` version 4.999.9beta.
- Fixed versions are 5.0.0 and above, and 5.2.0 and above.
- The issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, which ship with the vulnerable version of xz.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a moderate security impact by Red Hat Product Security.
- A patch was made to address the vulnerability.

**Demonstration of Vulnerability:**
```
$ touch /tmp/semi\;colon
$ xzgrep anystring /tmp/semi\;colon
xz: /tmp/semi: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/xzgrep: line 199: colon: command not found
```
This output shows that `xzgrep` tries to access the file `/tmp/semi` and then attempts to execute the command `colon`, demonstrating the vulnerability.

**Exploitation Example**
```
touch '/var/tmp/;echo -e "cp -p \0057bin\0057bash \0057var\0057tmp\0057\nchmod u+s \0057var\0057tmp\0057bash"
sh-4.1# find /var/tmp -type f -exec xzgrep anystring {} \+
```
This example attempts to create a SUID root copy of bash, achieving privilege escalation
