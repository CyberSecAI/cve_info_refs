  "CVE-2015-4516": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 allowed remote attackers to bypass certain ECMAScript 5 (aka ES5) API protection mechanisms and modify immutable properties, and consequently execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges, via a crafted web page that did not use ES5 APIs.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper enforcement of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) API protection mechanisms in Mozilla Firefox. The browser used specific logic for each API to enforce non-configurable property immutability. However, scripts not utilizing these APIs could bypass these protections, allowing modifications of immutable properties.",

        "Improper enforcement of ES5 API protection mechanisms.",
        "Bypassing configurability of properties."
