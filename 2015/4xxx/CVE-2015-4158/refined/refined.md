The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in SAP products. However, only CVE-2015-2282 and CVE-2015-2278 are relevant. The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**CVE-2015-2282**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the LZC compression algorithm implementation within SAP products.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the `CsDecomprLZC` function where an attacker-controlled value `code`, when greater than or equal to 256, is used to index the `TAB_SUFFIXOF` table. If the prefix table value is also greater than 256, it results in a stack overflow. The attacker can control the values in the prefix and suffix tables to fill the stack with arbitrary values.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * Remote Code Execution: The attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on the client or server.
    * Complete control over the application: The injected code will run with the same privileges as the vulnerable application.
    * Denial of Service: An overflow can terminate the process of the vulnerable component, leading to service unavailability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Server Component:** Attacker forges requests with specially crafted LZC compressed data targeting vulnerable SAP NetWeaver services such as Gateway and Dispatcher processes
    *   **Client Component:** Attacker creates a malicious .CAR or .SAR package containing specially crafted LZC compressed data that, when unarchived by a client, executes attacker-controlled code.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** If the affected services are not encrypted, an attacker can inject malicious packets with LZC compressed data during communication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send crafted requests to a vulnerable SAP server, or
    *   Ability to deliver a malicious .CAR or .SAR package to a client, or
    *   Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and server.

**CVE-2015-2278**
*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the LZH compression algorithm implementation within SAP products.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: The vulnerability lies within the `BuildHufTree` function. The function indexes arrays 'e' and 'd' using the value `*p - s`. An attacker can control the values of `p` and `s`, thus controlling the array indices. This allows the attacker to read data outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  Information Disclosure: Attacker can read memory outside the intended buffer.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Same as CVE-2015-2282.
    *   **Server Component:** Attacker forges requests with specially crafted LZH compressed data targeting vulnerable SAP NetWeaver services.
    *   **Client Component:** Attacker creates a malicious .CAR or .SAR package containing specially crafted LZH compressed data that, when unarchived by a client, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** If the affected services are not encrypted, an attacker can inject malicious packets with LZH compressed data during communication.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Same as CVE-2015-2282.
    *   Ability to send crafted requests to a vulnerable SAP server, or
    *   Ability to deliver a malicious .CAR or .SAR package to a client, or
    *   Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and server.
