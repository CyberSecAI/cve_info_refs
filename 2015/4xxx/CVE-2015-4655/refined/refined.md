Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4655:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the `entry.cgi` script of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).
* The root cause is an incorrect response content type being set. The server sends a `Content-Type: text/html` header, but the actual response body is JSON.
* The `compound` parameter in the request is echoed back into the response without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The server reflects user-supplied data in the response without sanitization, leading to XSS.
* **Incorrect Content Type Handling:** The server incorrectly declares the response as HTML, when it actually contains JSON. This allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Client-Side Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a victim's browser when the victim opens a specially crafted URL.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session tokens and potentially gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
* **Credential Theft:** If the user has stored credentials in the browser, attackers can steal them by using malicious javascript code.
* **Arbitrary Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim by interacting with the application.
* **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect victims to malicious websites, potentially leading to further attacks like phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Specially Crafted URL:** The attacker creates a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `compound` parameter.
* **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks the victim into clicking on the malicious URL, usually via phishing, email, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with malicious payloads.
* **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to click the URL. This does not require any access to the system other than ability to send the link to the victim.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory provides a specific vulnerable version of Synology DSM: 5.2-5565.
