  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2015-4075": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the 'item' and 'keys' parameters within the language.save task, allowing arbitrary file uploads.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unrestricted File Upload",
        "Path Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can create or overwrite .ini files on the server. In a poorly configured system, this could lead to arbitrary code execution by including malicious arguments in the .ini files. At minimum, an attacker can replace non-protected .ini files.",

          "network": "The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP requests.",
          "input_vectors": "The 'item' and 'keys' parameters within the POST data are used to specify the target filename and its content."
