Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `strMessage` parameter in the `login.jsp` page of the eClinicalWorks Population Health (CCMR) Client Portal Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability exists. The application directly reflects the unsanitized `strMessage` parameter in the response without proper encoding, which allows the execution of malicious javascript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which would then be executed within the browser of a victim user. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   **Data Theft:**  Accessing sensitive data displayed within the application.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Injecting scripts that deliver malicious payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload within the `strMessage` parameter of the `login.jsp` page.
*   The attacker must lure the victim into visiting this crafted URL. This can be done through various methods, such as:
    *   Phishing emails
    *   Malicious links on other websites
    *   Social Engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious URL. No prior authentication is needed.
