{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation in the `ajax_cmd.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The script outputs user-provided data without proper sanitization, which can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a specially crafted GET request to the `/ajax_cmd.php` script with a malicious payload in the `fileName` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required. The attack is remote."
