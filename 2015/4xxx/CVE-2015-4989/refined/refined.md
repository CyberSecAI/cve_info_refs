- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience portal does not properly restrict access to chart images, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control on the "temp_chart" directory where images of charts are stored. An attacker with knowledge of internal chart names can retrieve the chart contents without proper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to chart images generated by other users. This could lead to information disclosure, although the severity is considered low with a CVSS base score of 3.7. There is no reported impact to integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker must have knowledge of the internal names assigned to charts displayed to authorized users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the internal name of the chart. The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, but needs to gain information about the naming scheme used internally to identify charts.
