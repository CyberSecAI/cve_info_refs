**2. Extracted Information for CVE-2015-4842**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) component of OpenJDK. This flaw allows an untrusted Java application or applet to access the value of the "user.dir" system property, which reveals the user's home directory location.
   
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
      - Information Disclosure: The vulnerability enables an attacker to bypass Java sandbox restrictions and access sensitive information about the user's environment (specifically the value of "user.dir").
      - Improper Access Control: The JAXP component does not properly restrict access to the "user.dir" property.
   
   - **Impact of Exploitation**:
      - An attacker can bypass Java sandbox restrictions by accessing the user.dir system property.
      - Disclosure of the user's home directory may lead to further information gathering by an attacker.
   
   - **Attack Vectors**:
      - Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over a network by delivering malicious applets or applications via web browsers.
      - A malicious, untrusted Java application or applet needs to be running to trigger the vulnerability.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious applet/application within a vulnerable environment.
      - The attacker needs to have network access to deliver the attack, in the context of applets.
      - No authentication is required for the attack.

**3. Additional Notes:**

  - The vulnerability affects Oracle Java SE 6u101, 7u85, and 8u60, as well as Java SE Embedded 8u51.
  - The provided content indicates that this issue has been resolved in newer versions of affected packages.
   - Several vendors, including SUSE and Red Hat, released security updates to address this vulnerability in their respective products.
   - The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity, but can enable further attacks, and can be used to bypass security protections.

**4. Summary of relevant information for CVE-2015-4842**
  - Root Cause: Information disclosure flaw in the JAXP component of OpenJDK due to insufficient access control of the "user.dir" system property.
