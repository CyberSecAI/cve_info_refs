## Topic

An updated ceph-deploy package that fixes two security issues is now
available for Red Hat Ceph Storage.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Ceph Storage is a massively scalable, open, software-defined
storage platform that combines the most stable version of Ceph with a Ceph
management platform, deployment tools, and support services.

It was discovered that ceph-deploy, a utility for deploying Red Hat Ceph
Storage, would create the keyring file with world readable permissions,
which could possibly allow a local user to obtain authentication
credentials from the keyring file. (CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)

All ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Subject: CVE Request for ceph-deploy world-readable keyring permissions

Hello,

ceph-deploy 1.5.23 fixes an issue with world-readable permissions on a
keyring containing private key material.

The 1.5.23 changelog states:
"Fix an issue where keyring permissions were world readable"

The problem was that the keyring file would be created with 644 mode. If
ceph-deploy was run as a dedicated non-root admin user, the keys would
be readable to all other (non-admin) users of the same group, thus
leaking authentication credentials.

The upstream pull request and commits are:
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/pull/272>
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/commit/eee56770393bf19ed2dd5389226c6190c08dee3f>

References:

<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=920926>

Could I get a CVE ID assigned please?

Thanks
Andreas Stieger
