Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ceph-deploy` utility, when using the `ceph-deploy admin` command, copies the keyring file (`ceph.client.admin.keyring`) to `/etc/ceph/` with world-readable permissions (644).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Insecure File Permissions:** The keyring file, which contains sensitive authentication credentials, is created with permissions that allow any local user on the system to read its contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Local users can gain access to the authentication credentials stored in the keyring file. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Ceph storage cluster and potential data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system where `ceph-deploy admin` was run.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `ceph-deploy` command was executed. They do not need any special privileges.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2015-3010 but is considered worse because the file is placed in `/etc/ceph`, which is more easily accessible than the original location in the user's home directory.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the keyring file was created with more restrictive permissions.

The provided information gives a clear picture of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
