Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-4474:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The primary root cause, according to the provided data, is a "Miscellaneous memory safety hazards" in the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox.  The vulnerability involves some sort of memory corruption that may occur under specific circumstances.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from unspecified memory safety issues. This type of vulnerability often includes out-of-bounds read/write, use-after-free, double-free and other memory corruption issues, but the specific nature of them for this CVE is not disclosed.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service. This is achieved by triggering memory corruption, which causes the application to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There's a possibility for arbitrary code execution, meaning that an attacker could potentially run malicious code on a victim's machine with the same privileges as the Firefox browser. This possibility is less certain than the DoS.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a website that triggers the vulnerability. The content of the specific webpage that could exploit this is not mentioned other than noting that the vector is an unspecified memory corruption in the browser engine.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker is remote and does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to host the malicious webpage and trick a victim into opening the page with a vulnerable version of Firefox.
