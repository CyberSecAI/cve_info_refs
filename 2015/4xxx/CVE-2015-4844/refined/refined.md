  "CVE-2015-4844": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2015-4844",
      "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u101, 7u85, and 8u60, and Java SE Embedded 8u51, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing boundary check in the ICU layout engine used by the OpenJDK 2D component, specifically when processing crafted font files.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Missing boundary checks",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "The missing boundary check can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption, which can be exploited by a malicious application or applet to gain elevated privileges, achieve arbitrary code execution or cause denial of service.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation through specially crafted font files or colour profiles",
        "Untrusted Java application or applet"
      ],
       "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious font file or color profile that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker must have a means of delivering this to the application running on the system, usually via a malicious applet or web page, or getting the system to process it via some other vector.",
      "Additional Details": "The vulnerability resides within the ICU layout engine within the 2D component of OpenJDK, specifically when handling font files, and that the issue was caused by bundled lcms2 code using fast floor() implementation. This vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted color profiles as well. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with JVM privileges."
