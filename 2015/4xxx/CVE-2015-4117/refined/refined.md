- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed via the `backup` HTTP GET parameter to `/list/backup/index.php` before using it in the PHP `exec()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the Vesta Control Panel "admin" account, potentially gaining complete control over the system, managing services, reconfiguring firewalls, and compromising other users' websites on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/list/backup/index.php` with the `backup` parameter containing injected OS commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires authentication to the Vesta Control Panel as an administrator or any registered client.
