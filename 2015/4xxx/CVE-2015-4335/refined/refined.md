Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Lua interpreter within Redis allowing the loading of insecure bytecode. This bypasses the intended Lua sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution on the host system. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the fact that the `lua_load` function was used instead of `lua_loadx` in `ldo.c`, this allowed to load unsafe bytecode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lua Sandbox Escape:** The core issue is the ability to break out of the Lua sandbox provided by Redis.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Redis process.
*   **Insecure Bytecode Loading:** The vulnerability arises due to the way Redis loads Lua bytecode which does not validate that the bytecode is safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can lead to full control over the system hosting the Redis server, including the ability to read/write data, install malware, and disrupt service.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored within Redis.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not the primary focus of the exploits, attackers could cause a denial of service by crashing the Redis process or overwhelming the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **EVAL Command:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `EVAL` command, which allows users to execute Lua scripts within Redis.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Redis can be attacked via HTTP, making it vulnerable to SSRF attacks and cross-origin requests.
*   **Network Access:**  An attacker needs network access to the Redis instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (with EVAL access):** The attacker must be able to use the `EVAL` command. This usually means they must be authenticated to the Redis server, unless it is misconfigured and open to unauthenticated access.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Lua Bytecode:** The attacker needs the ability to construct Lua bytecode that is designed to escape the sandbox.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Redis server, either directly or via techniques like SSRF.
*   **Knowledge of Lua Internals:** The attacker needs knowledge of the internal workings of Lua to create the necessary exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Cawley, and the primitives to create the exploits were based on his work.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited on Linux 64 bit and OSX 64 bit.
*   Exploits can be crafted to avoid crashing the Redis server.
*   The exploit can use techniques similar to `dynelf` to find the base address of redis and libc.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a strong password on Redis, renaming the `EVAL` command or upgrading to a patched version of Redis.
