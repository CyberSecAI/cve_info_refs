# Redis EVAL Lua Sandbox Escape

It is possible to break out of the Lua sandbox in Redis and execute arbitrary
code. This vulnerability is not new and is heavily based on
[Peter Cawley’s work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMOTDLrBCQ) with Lua bytecode
[type confusion](https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486).

This shouldn’t pose a threat to users under the trusted Redis security model
where only trusted users can connect to the database. However, in real
deployments there could be databases that can be accessed by untrusted users.
The main deployments that are vulnerable are developers machines, places where
redis servers can be reached via SSRF attacks and cloud hosting.

[Redis 2.8.21 and 3.0.2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/4Y6OqK8gEyk/Dg-5cejl-eUJ) have been released to fix this issue.

# Vulnerable Deployments

## Developers Machines

Developers machines may be vulnerable because they bind Redis to all interfaces
which used to be the default listen directive in the Redis configuration.

Developers may also be vulnerable even if they bind to 127.0.0.1 because Redis
is effectively a HTTP server. The first mention of attacking Redis via HTTP I
could find is by [Nicolas Grégoire](http://www.agarri.fr/kom/archives/2014/09/11/trying_to_hack_redis_via_http_requests/index.html)
where he documents attacking a Redis server on a Facebook property using a SSRF
vulnerability.

Because Redis is a HTTP server the same origin policies of browsers will allow
any website on the internet to send a POST request to it. When using XHR the
body is completely controllable. For example if you run the following in the
console of your webbrowser while running wireshark:

```
var x = new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST", "http://127.0.0.1:6379");
x.send('eval "print(\\"hello\\")" 0\r\n');

```

In wireshark you will see:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:6379
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 27
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Origin: http://www.agarri.fr
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Referer: http://www.agarri.fr/kom/archives/2014/09/11/trying_to_hack_redis_via_http_requests/index.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8

eval "print(\"hello\")" 0
-ERR unknown command 'POST'
-ERR unknown command 'Host:'
-ERR unknown command 'Connection:'
-ERR unknown command 'Content-Length:'
-ERR unknown command 'Pragma:'
-ERR unknown command 'Cache-Control:'

-ERR unknown command 'Content-Type:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept:'
-ERR unknown command 'Referer:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept-Encoding:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept-Language:'
$-1

```

And in the stdout for Redis you will see:

```
hello

```

The attacker is not able to read the response from the server because of the
same origin policy. However, this might be worked around by using a [DNS rebinding attack](https://miki.it/blog/2015/4/20/the-power-of-dns-rebinding-stealing-wifi-passwords-with-a-website/).
Even with DNS rebinding it might not be possible to read the response because
the response is not valid HTTP.

However, reading the response is not necessary because you can package a super generic
exploit that checks the result of the redis.call(“INFO”) command and then
launches a OS/architecture specific payload.

## SSRF attacks

This is similar to attacking developers except a trusted server is tricked into
making a request to the Redis server However, you need a lot of control over
the body which might not often be possible depending on how the body is encoded.

## Redis Cloud Hosting

This will only effect providers where people running arbitrary code from the
Redis process is not part of their threat model. The major players in this area
look like they are using sandboxing. For example the pids returned by ‘INFO’ on
heroku are very low <10 which indicates they are running the Redis servers in
containers. You can already run arbitrary code in containers via dynos on Heroku
so running arbitrary code in a Redis container is probably not useful for an
attacker. Amazon Elasticcache also looks like it uses linux containers.

Similarily, it looks like Microsoft’s hosted Redis solution runs in an
isolated VM. Redis ‘INFO’ returns a virtual os string and it takes ~15
minutes to launch an instance. If MS aren’t running in an isolated VM then the
15 minute startup time is very weird.

This will be a problem if a hosting provider runs a whole bunch of redis
processes on the same machine/same VM from different customers without any
kind of isolation.

# Exploit

[Peter Cawley](https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486) has found that the
loadstring function can be used to load bytecode that is unsafe. He has
created three very useful lua exploit primitives that make exploitation easy.

First is a way of reading the Value contained in a TValue struct. This allows
reading the pointer value from a lua tagged value. Some pointer values are
already public (using tostring) but there doesn’t seem to be a way to get the
pointer value for a lua string so this is useful.

Second is a way of reading 8 bytes from an arbitrary memory address.

Third is a way of writing 8 bytes to an arbitrary memory address.

Using the arbitrary memory read it is possible to leak the address of a known
C function. From the address of this c-function it is possible to find the base
address of the redis-server binary. From this base address it is possible to
find pointers to libc/libsystem\_c functions and to find the base address of the
libc/libsystem\_c libraries. From these libraries it is possible to find the
addresses of useful exported functions (longjump/system) and ROP gadgets. This
technique is similar to pwntools [dynelf](http://pwntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dynelf.html)

The arbitrary memory read is also used to leak an address inside the stack. The
lua\_State object holds a long\_jump variable that references a long\_jump buffer
that is allocated on the stack. This leaks the stack address which can be useful
if you just want to corrupt the stack or the rsp and rip can be overwritten in
the longjump buf to directly take control when longjump is called. OSX has no
pointer mangling protections so this is quite easy to corrupt.

On linux the rip and rsp (and rbp) values are mangled. However, if you have full
read access to the memory you can reverse the secret cookie value to corrupt
the values. Also, linux prevents you from longjmp'ing to an invalid stack frame
(ie: the heap) but you can longjump to point the stack inside the longjump
buffer then pivot the stack into the heap. This is not really necessary if you
don’t care about corrupting the stack and crashing the redis process but if you
longjump and don’t corrupt the stack then you can resume normal execution of
redis after the exploit has finished running.

# Exploitability

I have exploits for Linux 64 bit and OSX 64 bit. Both exploits take care to not
crash the redis server during successful execution. They will make a call to
system() then go back to normal redis execution.

I have run the Linux exploit on the Amazon RHEL Image (PIE enabled) and the
Amazon 14.04 Ubuntu Image (no PIE). I believe the exploit will work on most
modern Linux 64 bit systems (I suspect it will not work if you compile libc with
fomit-frame-pointer but this can be worked around). It does not use any
hardcoded addresses from libc or the Redis binary.

The OSX version I have only tested on Yosemite but an earlier version was
working on Mavericks and I believe the Yosemite version works on both. This has
been tested with two different Redis versions and similarily does not depend on
hardcoded address from libsystem\_c or the Redis binary. However, it uses
addresses from libsystem\_c to speed up the exploit.

# Workarounds

The best option is to set a strong password on Redis. Systems that are reachable
via HTTP without a password are a problem waiting to happen.

It is also possible to rename the EVAL command. If you are not using EVAL this
is a good option but you still might be at risk of someone modifying your Redis
data via HTTP SSRF attacks.

Upgrading to [Redis 2.8.21 and 3.0.2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/4Y6OqK8gEyk/Dg-5cejl-eUJ)
will also fix this issue but I still strongly recommend using password
authentication on Redis systems.

Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-4335

It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, could
execute insecure Lua bytecode by way of the EVAL command. This could
allow remote attackers to break out of the Lua sandbox and execute
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed
in version 2:3.0.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.0.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.

Subject: CVE Request: redis Lua sandbox escape and arbitrary code execution

Hello,

redis 3.0.2 and 2.8.21 have been released with the following changelog entry:

> Upgrade urgency: HIGH for Redis because of a security issue.
>                  LOW for Sentinel.
>
> * [FIX] Critical security issue fix by Ben Murphy: <http://t.co/LpGTyZmfS7>

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/4Y6OqK8gEyk/Dg-5cejl-eUJ>

The vulnerability is explained in more detail at:
<http://benmmurphy.github.io/blog/2015/06/04/redis-eval-lua-sandbox-escape/>

As far as I understand it, the Lua interpreter allows the user to load insecure
bytecode that can be used to bypass the redis Lua sandbox.

The upstream patch fixing this is:
<https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/fdf9d455098f54f7666c702ae464e6ea21e25411>

I don't think a CVE has been assigned for this yet.

Cheers

The Ben Murphy advisory has a long discussion of many software and
deployment issues. Do you have a specific viewpoint about what the CVE
ID should be for? In particular, is the essence of the request that
the Redis upstream vendor believes that loading Lua bytecode was, by
itself, inherently an implementation mistake in Redis, and is now
fixed by the
<https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/fdf9d455098f54f7666c702ae464e6ea21e25411>
change?

By way of background: we have previously tried to gather information
for assigning CVE IDs to the underlying bytecode security concerns in
Lua (see the <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/27/2>
post), but this was unsuccessful. If the currently needed CVE ID should
be only about Redis, as mentioned in the above paragraph, then we will
not be revisiting those Lua issues now.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
