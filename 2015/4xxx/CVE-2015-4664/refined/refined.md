Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-4664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary root cause is a lack of proper input validation in the `login.php` script and the `/sbin/spadmind` service. Specifically, user-supplied data is directly used in system commands without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection in `login.php`:** The `id` POST parameter in the login form allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Linux commands.
*   **Privilege Escalation via `spadmind`:** The `spadmind` service, which runs with root privileges, takes text-based commands via a socket and directly executes them without validation. This enables local privilege escalation when combined with the command injection vulnerability in login.php, allowing a remote attacker to execute commands as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the `www-data` user via the `login.php` command injection vulnerability.
*   **Privilege Escalation to Root:** By leveraging the `spadmind` service with the command injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the root user.
*  **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the Xsuite host, giving the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request to `login.php`:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the `/login.php` endpoint, injecting commands into the `id` parameter.
*   **Local Socket Connection to `spadmind`:** After initial access via `login.php`, the attacker leverages the vulnerable `spadmind` process by sending specially crafted text-based messages to its listening socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Xsuite host.
*  **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
*   **Local Access to `spadmind` socket (after initial access):** The attacker needs to have the ability to send data to the localhost socket used by the spadmind process. This is possible by leveraging the initial command injection vulnerability,

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Xceedium Xsuite versions 2.3.0 and 2.4.3.0, and likely other versions as well.
*   The injected commands from `login.php` are executed with `www-data` user privileges.
*   The `spadmind` process listens on `localhost:2210`.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely when combined with the command injection vulnerability
