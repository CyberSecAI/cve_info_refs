- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow due to unsafe memory block copy operation when parsing large HTTP headers in `WLTermProxyService.exe`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe memory handling in the parsing of HTTP requests. Specifically a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with large headers to the `WLTermProxyService.exe` service, which listens on port 4428 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected service. No authentication is required.
