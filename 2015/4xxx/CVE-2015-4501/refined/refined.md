Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-4501:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is described as "multiple unspecified vulnerabilities" in the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox. These vulnerabilities lead to memory corruption and application crashes. The exact nature of these memory safety issues is not detailed in the provided text, except that they are within the browser engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The documents indicate "miscellaneous memory safety hazards" without specifying concrete weaknesses. 
- The vulnerability results in memory corruption.
- There are also mentions of potential UAF (Use After Free) conditions, however, it's not directly identified as a vulnerability. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (application crash).
- Potentially, arbitrary code execution may be possible but is not definitive based on available information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through unspecified remote means. The official description mentions “unknown vectors.” Based on other CVEs grouped with this update, these vectors include crafted javascript or crafted web pages/URLs

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted payload (e.g., a malformed URL, crafted JavaScript) to a vulnerable Firefox instance. No specific requirements beyond this are identified in the documents.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The provided content indicates that several memory safety bugs in the Firefox browser engine were fixed. Some of these memory safety bugs resulted in memory corruption. 
- One of the analyzed bug reports ([Bug 1165706](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1165706)) indicates an issue with Skia canvas and worker threads leading to a crash, which appears to be related to the multiple memory safety hazards grouped under CVE-2015-4501. The fix involves reverting a change that used worker threads for canvas rendering. The crash occurred due to a race condition when accessing SkPixelRef in a multi-threaded context. 
- The fix for the vulnerability in that specific bug was a backout which disabled some multi-threading functionality related to canvas rendering in the browser and does not represent a complete fix for the underlying memory corruption issues.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is often mentioned alongside other related CVEs, indicating multiple memory safety issues fixed in a single update.
- It is described as having "important" severity by SUSE.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 41 and Firefox ESR 38.3.
- Some of the documents provide more detail and context by referencing specific code commits, bug reports, and affected functions, although they do not fully clarify the nature of the unspecified vectors.
