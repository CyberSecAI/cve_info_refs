Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4010:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content from `exploit-db.com` and `seclists.org` directly references CVE-2015-4010 and describes the vulnerability in the "Encrypted Contact Form" WordPress plugin.
   - The provided content from marc.info confirms that CVE-2015-4010 is one of the multiple vulnerabilities addressed by the security update for HP-UX systems running Java 7. The vulnerability is related to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Developer Kit (JDK).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **CSRF:** The primary root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the plugin's admin settings page. This allows an attacker to perform actions as an administrator without their knowledge.
   - **XSS:** A secondary root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `iframe_url` POST parameter, enabling a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin's admin functionality is vulnerable to CSRF, meaning a malicious actor could craft a request that an authenticated user would unknowingly execute, leading to unauthorized modification of plugin settings.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically the `iframe_url` parameter, the plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. This means an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the browsers of other users who visit pages that display the contact form.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary Code Execution (via XSS):** The most significant impact is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of visitors viewing pages with the contact form. This could lead to:
        - **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
        - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious sites.
        - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the affected page.
   - **Unauthorized Modification:** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can modify plugin settings, such as changing the recipient of the contact form data or modifying the iframe URL which can lead to XSS attack.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **CSRF:** An attacker would craft a malicious HTML page or link that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, would send a forged request to the WordPress plugin. This request could change the iframe URL.
   - **XSS:** Once the vulnerable `iframe_url`  parameter is modified, the XSS payload will be triggered when a user loads the contact form with the modified `iframe_url` which includes malicious javascript.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link.
   - **XSS:** The attacker needs to successfully exploit the CSRF vulnerability to inject the malicious javascript in `iframe_url`. The XSS payload is then executed when users visit pages with the contact form.
