| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1251318#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-08-07 00:47:31 UTC  ``` Security researcher Cody Crews reported on a way to violate the same origin policy and inject script into a non-privileged part of the built-in PDF Viewer. This would allow an attacker to read and steal sensitive local files on the victim's computer.  Mozilla has received reports that an exploit based on this vulnerability has been found in the wild.   External References:  <https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2015/mfsa2015-78.html> <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1563163> <https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Cody Crews as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1251318#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-08-07 23:08:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2015:1581 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1581.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1251318#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-08-10 08:10:18 UTC  ``` Note:  The Firefox package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 is not confined by selinux (runs in unconfined_t domain). Processes running in unconfined_t domain get complete access to the system and are only restricted by the conventional DAC system. (restricted by file system permissions, acls etc)  This security flaw could therefore be exploited to steal files, which the user running firefox has access to, and cannot be mitigated by enabling selinux.  There are several resources available which deal which confining firefox by using selinux (with different success rates):  <http://people.redhat.com/tscherf/articles/lm_en_selinux.pdf> <http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/15700.html> <http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/28545.html>   ``` |  |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-78

## Same origin violation and local file stealing via PDF reader

Announced
August 6, 2015
Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS
Fixed in

* Firefox 39.0.3
* Firefox ESR 38.1.1
* Firefox OS 2.2

### Description

Security researcher **Cody Crews** reported on a way to
violate the same origin policy and inject script into a non-privileged part
of the built-in PDF Viewer. This would allow an attacker to read and steal
sensitive local files on the victim's computer.

Mozilla has received reports that an exploit based on this vulnerability
has been found in the wild.

# Security Advisories for Firefox ESR

### Impact key

* Critical
  Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
  software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
* High
  Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
  from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
  those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
* Moderate
  Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
  except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
  require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
* Low
  Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
  attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
  SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
  used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-06-17 08:59:16 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #931600](show_bug.cgi?id=931600 "NEW - VUL-0: CVE-2015-4000: The Logjam Attack / weakdh.org") +++  This bug tracks Logjam for Mozilla NSS. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2015-06-17 11:44:09 UTC  ``` <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1138554>  has this patch:  <https://bug1138554.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8608384>  but it adds a new function in the 3.19.1 namespace. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c3)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2015-06-17 11:53:14 UTC  ``` As NSS updates usually has a promise to keep compatibility I plan to update NSS to 3.19.1 with Firefox 39 within the next 1-2 weeks. It's a requirement anyway for that Firefox version.  There are still changes in NSS when it comes to the root certificate store but those are not relevant for openSUSE as the currently shipped NSS already has those. But compared with older NSS versions as shipped e.g. with Firefox 31ESR the truststore is changed. The NSS developers provide the NSS_3_19_1_WITH_CKBI_1_98_RTM tag for distributions who require the truststore to be ESR31 compatible and not changed at this moment. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c4)  Petr Cerny   2015-06-17 15:35:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Rosenauer from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c3)) > As NSS updates usually has a promise to keep compatibility I plan to update > NSS to 3.19.1 with Firefox 39 within the next 1-2 weeks. It's a requirement > anyway for that Firefox version.  I've burnt myself once already, with FF17 IIRC - the NSS update broke measurable number of https connections. So I'll try to trim the patch from 3.19.1 to a necessary minimum for SLE and stay with 3.18 (we're switching to FF38 anyway). ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-06-17 22:00:27 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=935033#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-06-30 08:16:42 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

# Firefox exploit found in the wild

Daniel Veditz
August 6, 2015

[224 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/#comments)

Yesterday morning, August 5, a Firefox user informed us that an advertisement on a news site in Russia was serving a Firefox exploit that searched for sensitive files and uploaded them to a server that appears to be in Ukraine. This morning Mozilla released [security updates](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version) that fix the [vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-78/). All Firefox users are urged to update to Firefox 39.0.3. The fix has also been shipped in Firefox ESR 38.1.1.

The vulnerability comes from the interaction of the mechanism that enforces JavaScript context separation (the “same origin policy”) and Firefox’s PDF Viewer. Mozilla products that don’t contain the PDF Viewer, such as Firefox for Android, are not vulnerable. The vulnerability does not enable the execution of arbitrary code but the exploit was able to inject a JavaScript payload into the local file context. This allowed it to search for and upload potentially sensitive local files.

The files it was looking for were surprisingly developer focused for an exploit launched on a general audience news site, though of course we don’t know where else the malicious ad might have been deployed. On Windows the exploit looked for subversion, s3browser, and Filezilla configurations files, `.purple` and Psi+ account information, and site configuration files from eight different popular FTP clients. On Linux the exploit goes after the usual global configuration files like `/etc/passwd`, and then in all the user directories it can access it looks for `.bash_history`, `.mysql_history`, `.pgsql_history`, `.ssh` configuration files and keys, configuration files for remina, Filezilla, and Psi+, text files with “pass” and “access” in the names, and any shell scripts. ~~Mac users are not targeted by this particular exploit but would not be immune should someone create a different payload.~~ [**Update:** we’ve now seen variants that do have a Mac section, looking for much the same kinds of files as on Linux.]

The exploit leaves no trace it has been run on the local machine. If you use Firefox on Windows or Linux it would be prudent to change any passwords and keys found in the above-mentioned files if you use the associated programs. People who use ad-blocking software may have been protected from this exploit depending on the software and specific filters being used.

            > The advantage of pdf.js is that it runs purely in Javascript, so if Firefox’s Javascript engine (and DOM) is secure, it will be secure. Opening a PDF in a separate program just shifts the security concerns over to that program, which just adds to the attack surface. The only questionable part about this is that the embedded pdf loaded automatically rather than presenting the user with a prompt or being click-to-play – but IIRC the same thing would have happened with the Adobe Reader plugin people used to use (could be wrong though, it’s been years).

            > Including our own PDF Viewer is an honest attempt to protect our users, the vast majority of whom otherwise end up using outdated versions of Adobe Reader which has been and still is actively exploited. If you prefer a more full-featured PDF Viewer and know you keep it secure feel free to go to about:preferences#applications , scroll down to PDF, and change it from “Preview in Firefox” to automatically save or open in the application of your choice.

Up until that point the PDF is just a binary blob.

The decision a couple years ago to remove “turn off JS” from the UI has worsened this immeasurably, as well as cementing the bloaty, script-heavy, dysfunctional style of web design that everything is afflicted with now, that almost always has no user benefits over Web 1.0 style pages. The change should have gone the other way: JS should have been turned off by default, with whitelisting for specific pages. In any case the same-origin policy should be strengthened so that it is impossible for sites other than the one in the nav bar to run any scripts at all (that means no ads with scripts, no google analytics script, etc). That would stop a lot of user tracking among other things.

It’s still very permissive as it originally was, allowing third parties to run unprecidented amounts of intrusive code on user machines.

Thus it is my contention that Mozilla and other browser vendors need to ramp up the security controls on Javascript bigtime. This includes controlling the entry and exit points into the engine and allowing users to control those points through non-hidden means (That means, not tucked away in about:config). The publishing industry may hate it but users at the end of the day need to protect themselves from malicious activity and the defaults on browsers simply doesn’t do it.

    > Similarly, right now, pop-ups are either on or off for a site, but the file upload dialog is considered a pop-up. This means that for sites like imgur.com, I have to turn it off to not be abused by ads pop-ing up windows to other sites, but have to turn it back on to be able to upload files. This is unworkable and far more work than simply approving each and every pop-up. Since I almost never want a pop-up and it’s easy to ignore the requests, this should be the default.

If Firefox is similarly reckless about accessing files outside of $HOME/~.mozilla/firefox without permission, then the only reasonable thing for people (and Linux distros, and ad-on security products) to do is to jail Firefox so that it can’t hurt itself.

    > tl;dr: You can try to write this off as a predictable, excusable security failure, but I see it as a long pattern of recklessness and disconnect from what’s reasonable that is inexcusable and puts Firefox in a bad light. Just as people shouldn’t need 3rd party pop-up blockers, dishing out files without explicit permission simply makes no sense. People almost never want that and if they do, they’ll approve the actual read or the actual pop-up.

It says it was found in a news site in Russia, but are there any reports of any other non-russian sites? I’m worried because this means that the code was able to access my encrypted directory as the browser is ran by the same user (something I will need to change from now on). How come the local files can be accessed with JS?, I thought that was well protected. Anyway, I think more details would be helpful to know if we could have been affected or not.

        > “Always Ask” would certainly mitigate the drive-by aspect, and you’d also be safe if you then chose to open PDFs in some other viewer. I’m honestly not sure what happens if you select the built-in viewer from that prompt. If it opens the PDF Viewer in a new tab that would be safe (and I suspect this is what it would do); if it opens the PDF Viewer in the original frame that may or may not be vulnerable. It should break the current exploit because of the asynchronicity, but whether that could be worked around or not would take some investigation.

Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

# Firefox exploit found in the wild

Daniel Veditz
August 6, 2015

[224 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/08/06/firefox-exploit-found-in-the-wild/#comments)

Yesterday morning, August 5, a Firefox user informed us that an advertisement on a news site in Russia was serving a Firefox exploit that searched for sensitive files and uploaded them to a server that appears to be in Ukraine. This morning Mozilla released [security updates](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version) that fix the [vulnerability](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-78/). All Firefox users are urged to update to Firefox 39.0.3. The fix has also been shipped in Firefox ESR 38.1.1.

The vulnerability comes from the interaction of the mechanism that enforces JavaScript context separation (the “same origin policy”) and Firefox’s PDF Viewer. Mozilla products that don’t contain the PDF Viewer, such as Firefox for Android, are not vulnerable. The vulnerability does not enable the execution of arbitrary code but the exploit was able to inject a JavaScript payload into the local file context. This allowed it to search for and upload potentially sensitive local files.

The files it was looking for were surprisingly developer focused for an exploit launched on a general audience news site, though of course we don’t know where else the malicious ad might have been deployed. On Windows the exploit looked for subversion, s3browser, and Filezilla configurations files, `.purple` and Psi+ account information, and site configuration files from eight different popular FTP clients. On Linux the exploit goes after the usual global configuration files like `/etc/passwd`, and then in all the user directories it can access it looks for `.bash_history`, `.mysql_history`, `.pgsql_history`, `.ssh` configuration files and keys, configuration files for remina, Filezilla, and Psi+, text files with “pass” and “access” in the names, and any shell scripts. ~~Mac users are not targeted by this particular exploit but would not be immune should someone create a different payload.~~ [**Update:** we’ve now seen variants that do have a Mac section, looking for much the same kinds of files as on Linux.]

The exploit leaves no trace it has been run on the local machine. If you use Firefox on Windows or Linux it would be prudent to change any passwords and keys found in the above-mentioned files if you use the associated programs. People who use ad-blocking software may have been protected from this exploit depending on the software and specific filters being used.

         > @Cadeyrn: Yes, software will have flaws. That’s why it’s important for Firefox to include as little software as possible. That’s why something like pdf.js shouldn’t be provided by default. It should be something that the user must install and enable on his or her own.

            > The advantage of pdf.js is that it runs purely in Javascript, so if Firefox’s Javascript engine (and DOM) is secure, it will be secure. Opening a PDF in a separate program just shifts the security concerns over to that program, which just adds to the attack surface. The only questionable part about this is that the embedded pdf loaded automatically rather than presenting the user with a prompt or being click-to-play – but IIRC the same thing would have happened with the Adobe Reader plugin people used to use (could be wrong though, it’s been years).

            > Including our own PDF Viewer is an honest attempt to protect our users, the vast majority of whom otherwise end up using outdated versions of Adobe Reader which has been and still is actively exploited. If you prefer a more full-featured PDF Viewer and know you keep it secure feel free to go to about:preferences#applications , scroll down to PDF, and change it from “Preview in Firefox” to automatically save or open in the application of your choice.

For example, if you use an FTP program you might configure it with passwords for the servers from which you regularly download files. For a developer the most concerning ones might be the .ssh files and the \_history files which can contain passwords or other sensitive data from commands entered on the command line, even if you didn’t intend to have the password saved anywhere.

Up until that point the PDF is just a binary blob.

Should everyone consider their password store to be compromised and change all the web passwords they have stored in it?

The decision a couple years ago to remove “turn off JS” from the UI has worsened this immeasurably, as well as cementing the bloaty, script-heavy, dysfunctional style of web design that everything is afflicted with now, that almost always has no user benefits over Web 1.0 style pages. The change should have gone the other way: JS should have been turned off by default, with whitelisting for specific pages. In any case the same-origin policy should be strengthened so that it is impossible for sites other than the one in the nav bar to run any scripts at all (that means no ads with scripts, no google analytics script, etc). That would stop a lot of user tracking among other things.

    > Javascript engines were originally implemented in a day and age where security wasn’t needed, JS was just used for moving stuff around the screeen, fluid motion of sites’ DOM elements, being able to drag stuff around, having client-side input validation and such. Thing is, over time, JS has gained a lot of responsibility as a language but security hasn’t been there to keep up with it. It’s still very permissive as it originally was, allowing third parties to run unprecidented amounts of intrusive code on user machines.

Now we have “local” javascript being leveraged to compromise local files.

Thus it is my contention that Mozilla and other browser vendors need to ramp up the security controls on Javascript bigtime. This includes controlling the entry and exit points into the engine and allowing users to control those points through non-hidden means (That means, not tucked away in about:config). The publishing industry may hate it but users at the end of the day need to protect themselves from malicious activity and the defaults on browsers simply doesn’t do it.

    > Accessing an arbitrary file outside of $HOME/.mozilla/firefox seems like it should reasonably require approval via a confirmation dialog box each and every time.
    >
    > Similarly, right now, pop-ups are either on or off for a site, but the file upload dialog is considered a pop-up. This means that for sites like imgur.com, I have to turn it off to not be abused by ads pop-ing up windows to other sites, but have to turn it back on to be able to upload files. This is unworkable and far more work than simply approving each and every pop-up. Since I almost never want a pop-up and it’s easy to ignore the requests, this should be the default.
    >
    > I know software written in C is always going to have exploits, but it seems like Firefox has systematically struggled with a gap in understanding what’s permissible to do without approval.
    >
    > Considering that almost no one ever wants any site to ever be able to open a pop-up, and that Firefox continues to struggle with forbidding this after a decade, Firefox fails to inspire confidence. If Firefox is similarly reckless about accessing files outside of $HOME/~.mozilla/firefox without permission, then the only reasonable thing for people (and Linux distros, and ad-on security products) to do is to jail Firefox so that it can’t hurt itself.
    >
    > I already run Firefox as a non-privileged user with the install itself owned by root (and until settings were changed, Firefox was freaking out that it couldn’t write its own files to upgrade itself — damn right you can’t write to your own install!) but I doubt I’m careful enough with file permissions for even this to be adequate, and most users aren’t nearly this careful.
    >
    > Please keep in mind that it’s not just developers who need some level of security, for the sake of their projects, as this exploit shows. As Mitnick’s social engineering attacks show, even low level office workers need a reasonable expectation of security.

    > tl;dr: You can try to write this off as a predictable, excusable security failure, but I see it as a long pattern of recklessness and disconnect from what’s reasonable that is inexcusable and puts Firefox in a bad light. Just as people shouldn’t need 3rd party pop-up blockers, dishing out files without explicit permission simply makes no sense. People almost never want that and if they do, they’ll approve the actual read or the actual pop-up.

     > I assume using NoScript set to block all javascript unless I click “temporarily allow all” would prevent this flaw.

Nevertheless, the malicious website still had first to run some other JS code just to trigger pdf.js and only after that the exploit could be run? So having NoScript enabled in such situation would still save me from being attacked, even though pdf.js itself wasn’t blacklisted?

     > I would like to know through which ads network this code was deployed (to see if the websites I visit are under that specific network). Also which ff plugins effectively blocked those ads?. It says it was found in a news site in Russia, but are there any reports of any other non-russian sites? I’m worried because this means that the code was able to access my encrypted directory as the browser is ran by the same user (something I will need to change from now on). How come the local files can be accessed with JS?, I thought that was well protected. Anyway, I think more details would be helpful to know if we could have been affected or not.

        > “Always Ask” would certainly mitigate the drive-by aspect, and you’d also be safe if you then chose to open PDFs in some other viewer. I’m honestly not sure what happens if you select the built-in viewer from that prompt. If it opens the PDF Viewer in a new tab that would be safe (and I suspect this is what it would do); if it opens the PDF Viewer in the original frame that may or may not be vulnerable. It should break the current exploit because of the asynchronicity, but whether that could be worked around or not would take some investigation.

# USN-2707-1: Firefox vulnerability

7 August 2015

Firefox could be made to expose sensitive information from local files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Cody Crews discovered a way to violate the same-origin policy to inject

script in to a non-privileged part of the PDF viewer. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

exploit this to read sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2015-4495](/security/CVE-2015-4495))

# Version: 39.0 [Should work version before 39.0.3]
# Tested on: Linux (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS) [Should probably work in OSX]
# CVE : 2015-4495

# POC code taken from https://github.com/vincd/CVE-2015-4495

1. Description
  This exploit allow attacker to read and copy information on victim's computer, once they view the web site crafted with this exploit.

2. Proof of Concept
  Create a index.html and copy and paste the following html into it:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>CVE-2015-4495</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Test</h1>
                <script type="text/javascript" src="./exploit.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            </body>
        </html>

    Run the index.html (Make sure the main.js is in the same directory) and we should be able to see the directory listing.

3. Solution
  Upgrade to the latest firefox ( > 39.0.3)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

(As a temporary solution?) that will make transition to OOP jsplugins easier. PlayPreview will be removed as a part of the jsplugins and moving PDF viewer to out-of-process architecture might take some time. Also it will be useful to have capturing of the original content stream implemented ([bug 964435](/show_bug.cgi?id=964435 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - [jsplugins] Allow capturing and re-using the initial plugin stream for jsplugins")) -- the PlayPreview lacks of this functionality as well.
We want to change logic of EMBED tags to disable any instantiation of the native PDF plugins if the internal PDF viewer is enabled. That will allow its stream converter take a priority. This also allows to use the original data stream, and not re-create a new one.

So I tried to hack on this last night but discovered that at least on my Mac we're treating the Adobe PDF plug-in as always disabled, which is not very helpful for debugging.
If you can tell me how to detect the "internal PDF viewer is enabled" state, I can try to put up some patches that implement this proposal for testing...Flags: needinfo?(ydelendik)

The PDF viewer detects if it is enabled via multiple configuration flags. See <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/extensions/pdfjs/content/PdfJs.jsm#275> . I think the best way to detect is PDF viewer is enabled is to check stream converter. I created a WIP patch (see attachment) -- I will check if the test page works on Windows with internval PDF viewer on/off soon.Flags: needinfo?(ydelendik)

We need to check this for loads in a docshell too, I expect. Basically in nsWebNavigationInfo::IsTypeSupported I expect.
Would it make sense to register a conversion (the same one, basically) to a more specific type (whatever type the conversion actually outputs) so we can check that and don't get confused by other converters that might get installed for application/pdf?

The WIP patch works in Windows and properly displays content is the Adobe NPAPI plugin (when it's selected instead of internal PDF Viewer)

Shall that just return OK for the 'application/pdf' when PDFJS enabled? If yes, is there any preference on location (file wise) for IsPDFJSEnabled() to avoid code duplication in nsObjectLoadingContent.cpp and nsWebNavigationInfo.cpp?

Yes, just returning NS\_OK after setting \*aIsTypeSupported = nsIWebNavigationInfo::UNSUPPORTED would be good there.

nsContentUtils?
> Tried the following without any luck:
You want to keep the registration under the old contract with \*/\*. You just \_also\_ want to add a registration for conversion "from=application/pdf&to=text/html", using the same classID and whatnot.

This comment should explicitly say that we want to claim the type is unsupported so that the PDF viewer's stream converter will get used.
The rest looks pretty reasonable.

For what it's worth, you can consider my feedback+ as r+ for the gecko bits. Not sure what the right review situation is for the actual bits that stop using playpreview, but as long as pdfjs still works I'm happy to claim r=me on those too. ;)

Cool, I checked pdf viewer (on/off) on Windows and it still works. I wanted to ping bdahl to check if he has different thoughts/ideas, but the patch is ready to land as is now.

You can observe behavior of the embedded PDF via different tags at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8628302> (using EMBED tag in the middle). So steps to test:
1. Open <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8628302>
2. Notice PDF content for all three cases (object/embed/iframe)
Notice if native plugin is selected (instead of internal PDF viewer) on the test configuration, the native plugin shall be shown.Flags: needinfo?(ydelendik)

My understanding here is that this patch fixes how embedded PDFs are displayed in Firefox while the internal PDF Viewer (pdf.js) is disabled. For example, on an affected build - say 39.0 (20150630154324) - using Adobe Reader to view the testcase from [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1179262#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove PlayPreview registration from PDF Viewer") while "pdfjs.disabled" is "true", will instead show nothing for the file embedded via <object> and a neterror for the one embedded via <iframe>, whereas the PDF Viewer (when active) displays all three of them properly inside the browser.
Thing is, the same behavior can be seen on a build where this is fixed - e.g. Nightly 42.0a1 (2015-08-05), using Adobe Reader. I've used Windows 7 (x64) to test this.

It shall work in both case with pdf.js enabled and disabled.
Please switch handler in options->applications (due to a bug the firefox might need to be restarted)
Notice that "pdfjs.disabled" shall not be used, at least without switching the handler.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1581)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was discovered in Mozilla Firefox that could be used to violate the
same-origin policy and inject web script into a non-privileged part of the
built-in PDF file viewer (PDF.js). An attacker could create a malicious web
page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal arbitrary files (including
private SSH keys, the /etc/passwd file, and other potentially sensitive
files) from the system running Firefox. (CVE-2015-4495)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Cody Crews as the original reporter.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 38.1.1 ESR, which corrects this issue. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This one is a really complex issue and it's me so I'm really going to try to condense this down.
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/xml/nsXMLPrettyPrinter.cpp#114>
You can start reading there to begin to understand this. Just get a general idea of what is happening as it's not terribly important except for one key detail. That is the fact that it is from c++ code that the prettyprint bindings for xml data are loaded. This involves importing two style sheets into the document, both of which don't show up through document.childNodes, but references to them are accessible through document.styleSheets.
These references get the normal native anonymous content protection goodness, but that can be bypassed with access to the XBL execution context. I'm using pieces of my older work from [bug 1045034](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045034 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - It's possible to use object element plugins to access anonymous content.") for that bypass, but I'm fairly close I believe to having another method of achieving the same thing.
Now to the interesting parts. Once you have access to these references one who looks will notice that the prototypes accessible from the ownerNode of the style sheet are prototypes which provide access to native methods. Here I'm tracing the \_\_proto\_\_ chain up to the Object prototype and using the native \_\_lookupSetter\_\_ method to bypass restrictions on windows that I shouldn't have access to.
Using this over powered \_\_lookupSetter\_\_ function I then get the location setter of a window that is inaccessible to me otherwise. With this location setter it's possible to bypass all restriction when setting the location property of any window except those that are chrome privileged.
In the testcase I'm attaching with this I use this location setter on a pdf viewer window to inject javascript into it via a javascript URI. I then have it load a local file because resource:// pages have that ability and still using the same OP location setter I show javascript execution in that window to prove that in fact the contents of the file loaded are fully accessible from content.
There, and that's as condensed down as possible for an issue this complicated I believe(for me). I still have to mention that it's also possible to manipulate about:home windows to achieve chrome privilege escalation but without a way to inject script into it, I thought this was more interesting.
I hope I didn't kill you guys with all that, and also let me know if this works in windows ok. you OSX guys will just have to trust the word of others.

Can you not just do:
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(i2.contentWindow, "location").set
to get the same function that you're getting via \_\_lookupSetter\_\_ in the attached testcase?

Then the location setter shouldn't allow javascript URIs. It would only be the location setter as can be obtained from the XBL context which AFAIK doesn't allow a javascript URI in a cross domain situation(this allows for XSS even). The prototypes available here from the NAC do not match the prototypes from i.contentWindow or i.contentWindow.wrappedJSObject.
I guess you could try that, but I wouldn't expect it to work. What made me even think to try this was that the prototype of the ownerNode in this instance doesn't match i.contentWindow.HTMLLinkElement.prototype or the wrappedJSObject equivalent. The only thing that is true about the ownerNode(from script) is that it is an instanceof i.contentWindow.HTMLLinkElement.
Who knows though maybe I way over thought this one.

Ok, bz is right here. I'm fairly sure I tried XSS with access to the XBL context in the past with no success, so I'm guessing this is a regression. I'll dig into it and see what I can come up with on that. It's still very interesting to me that the prototypes accessible from NAC aren't what they're expected to be. Can anyone explain that?

Cody, this is top-notch work - super clever, 3-part exploit (built on an earlier bug that we haven't fixed, though are working hard to get fixed). Al, I recommend a generous bounty on this one. This is exactly the kind of exploit I expect to see at pwn2own 2016 unless we assign someone to fix up our loading permission story.
IIUC, cody starts by using [bug 1045034](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045034 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - It's possible to use object element plugins to access anonymous content.") to get access to both the playPreview scope \_and\_ its XBL scope running with an nsExpandedPrincipal. Cody, you mentioned above that you might have another way to do that part without using playPreview. Is that the case? if so, please file it as a separate bug and NI me.
Next, he uses the playPreview scope to load a file:// URI in an iframe. Cody, is this also part of [bug 1045034](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045034 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - It's possible to use object element plugins to access anonymous content."), or something different? Boris, any estimation of the compat risk of preventing resource:// URIs from loading file:// ?
Finally, he exploits a bug in DocShell in which, while trying to avoid inheriting an nsEP from the caller [1], we end up inheriting the principal of the docshell's active document for the triggering principal [2]. This means that, when the nsJSThunk runs async, the security check ends up passing [3].
This is a regression from [bug 821809](/show_bug.cgi?id=821809 "RESOLVED FIXED - run jetpack content scripts with nsExpandedPrincipal"), I think, though the previous state (inheriting the nsEP into a DOMWindow) probably wasn't much better.
Boris, what do you think? Should we just mint an nsNullPrincipal at [1] in the nsEP case? it seems like we should basically never be inheriting the principal in the javascript:// uri case, but I'm not sure how to enforce that.

I've reduced cody's testcase a bit using SpecialPowers to replace the
dependency on [bug 1045034](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045034 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - It's possible to use object element plugins to access anonymous content."). This demonstrates the third part of the exploit,
which is the new part discussed above.

I have to admit here I kind of fell uphill on this one. I only thought to try this because as I said the prototypes involved from the prettyprint bindings aren't what they're expected to be.
with styleSheet being a reference to the style sheet here from the XBL scope it should be like this:
styleSheet.ownerNode.\_\_proto\_\_ === i.contentWindow.HTMLLinkElement.prototype
and to access the prototype as the content of i.contentWindow one should use i.contentWindow.wrappedJSObject.HTMLLinkElement.prototype.
I'm sure you can get what I'm saying from that, the only strange part is neither prototype is actually the prototype of the ownerNode. This led me to have the idea that by using the Object prototype accessible via the \_\_proto\_\_ chain, that it may allow one to bypass security restrictions.

I've been very close to this by using the marquee bindings. I've also ran into a most interesting bug that I'll try to get a testcase to show off from script in which by placing certain elements that generate NAC as a child of a marquee you permanently poison a profile. With this bad profile all the methods/fields that have exposeToUntrustedContent set to true, aren't actually accessible from content anymore. It throws no errors and doesn't crash anything therefore is extremely hard to debug.
I have concerns the above mentioned bug could possibly work in reverse and have anonymous content influence the way NAC works, so when I get a testcase that reproduces the issue I'll mark it security sensitive. I'll also continue the work I was doing to use the marquee bindings to compromise the XBL scope and follow up as needed.

Thinking about this a little more I may be able to answer Bobby's questions a little more straight forward.
I already knew that resource:// URIs could load file:// URIs as I also knew that before pwn2own 2015 that resource:// URIs could load chrome:// URIs. I remember discussing it with Daniel or Al at some point on IRC though they might not remember. The only magic here is the location setter obtained allows javascript URI's in windows that it shouldn't. It also makes me want to meet Mariusz Mlynski even more than after pwn2own 2014 because I swear the guy is living in my head but seems better able to apply the knowledge floating around in there ;)
Jokes aside I absolutely have to set down and have a coffee or something with him because we seem to think scarily close in terms of security research. If I actually planned on attending pwn2own this year my focus for the work was going to be the fact that resource:// URIs could load chrome:// URIs and whatever I could build on that.

No, sadly. Seems pretty risky to me, but we could at least try it on nightly...

We did that more or less on purpose, right? But an alternative here would in fact be to not inherit at all in this case. That would end up not running javascript:, I expect and give data: a nullprincipal when it loads.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Here's just something to look at along the lines of not inheriting the owner. I'm reading up on the proper way to do this using mercurial and hg or even MozReview. This probably needs to be redone anyway because this is wasting a call to IsExpandedPrincipal. I'm thinking two different conditionals representing each call individually instead of the call to IsSystemOrExpanedPrincipal. If this is totally way off or if I'm stepping on anyone's toes just ignore it.

Here is a more proper patch generated with hg. This also doesn't waste a call to IsExpandedPrincipal. Ignore the parent listed as I used the 39 branch source to test this patch as I noticed that accessing anonymous content from [bug 1045034](/show_bug.cgi?id=1045034 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - It's possible to use object element plugins to access anonymous content.") has been stopped in the newest nightly. I can easily generate the same patch from the newest nightly if needed.
Which would be a bigger performance hit here, a wasted call to IsExpandedPrincipal, or breaking the whole thing down into two separate conditional statements as I have?
This only takes care of the problem of inheriting the owner in the case of nsExpandedPrincipal which pertains to data, and javascript URIs plus the special use cases of about:blank. I'll wait to hear from those more familiar with this for the other part needed.
Also bz I hope you don't mind me NI'ing you here.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I should have directed the question below directly to you I guess. I was looking more for feedback, maybe a review once I properly generate the patch from the newest nightly. I thought you were probably the authority on how this should be handled. I can attempt the second patch to stop resource:// URIs from loading file:// URIs too if need be. I'm just trying to be helpful.

Ah. Two conditional statements, with "else" so the second one doesn't even run if the first one tests true, is better.

Can I get some feedback on this when you see it bz? This patch is generated from changes made to the newest nightly, so possibly a review? I'm going to start looking into the source to see where the resource:// protocol is handled and where changes need to be made to prevent loading file:// URIs.

Starting tomorrow I \*should\* be gone for approximately a week. I never did get to part two, but part one here is a fairly minimal change. Just handle things as if I was here anyway(like previously before I was getting more involved).
I'll try to be in touch some during this coming week but don't expect much. I'm sure you guys have it handled either way. Thanks in advance for the hard work guys.

I just wanted to clarify while I had a minute today. I'm currently in the process of moving which is why I am going to have limited access to keep in touch with you guys. I know I move a lot but in the great state of North Carolina it's almost impossible to find a place that's actually everything it's supposed to be throughout a lease.
I really wanted to get to part two of this as I felt it would be more challenging than part 1 by far. Should I need info bz to get the review rolling? I'll just do that anyway as I need to start packing things and such. I still have the net right now but wont after this move starts, so also if anything on the payout front happens just tell Chris to push it through to the most current account information on file for me.
I can't be sure that I'll even have the technicians out after this move in time to be back but I've prearranged it so that it should happen in the amount of time I've listed. When this is done I should be as active as I have been and hopefully more so as time builds.

Can I get a review on this bz? I flagged bholley on this as well as he was a suggested person but I know you're probably the one that really needs to look at it.
If you can after you look it over if nothing is needed(it's a very minimal change) then just make sure Bobby isn't bothered by it too. Also just commit the changes as yourself if needed. Just as long as it gets handled.
I'll try to keep an eye on things but I may go ahead and leave ASAP because my new neighbors are driving me crazy ;-)Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

bug-1178058-part1.patch
So I thought about this a bit more and I think what we should really do is what Bobby suggested in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1178058#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - It's possible to read local files or perform privilege escalation by using a native setter"): treat the expanded principal case just like we treat the LOAD\_FLAGS\_DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_OWNER case. I'll post a patch to that effect in a moment...

Yeah sorry about that, I've never had the honor/burden of being flagged for review so I didn't know it would double up your nag emails :P
I'm uploading what should be a viable start to part 2 of the fix for this and I guess I'll just flag Bobby for review, but I would definitely like your feedback too.

Just thought I would say the only time I can get to anything during this week is late, it's currently 11:48 PM EST here and now I must sleep!
The above patch should be a good start, I'm sure we may want to allow for special use cases. I'm also not sure what "But watch out for the view-source stylesheet?" in the comments means. Help me anywhere I'm missing anything here guys. Also if there's activity on this bug and there's no activity from me after 10 PM EST after that then maybe the next day.

I've been looking over writing tests for changes such as this, and I think I have it figured out except one issue here. The attempt to execute javascript in another window fails silently. The tests I've looked over involve catching errors to confirm that things are handled properly usually.
Any suggestions? I'll be digging deeper into making tests until I hear something.

So... I'm not sure how complete an answer this is. But clicking a bookmarklet link on the bookmarks toolbar just ends up calling browser (like XBL browser) .loadURI with the js URL and flags being 0 (notably, we don't pass LOAD\_FLAGS\_DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_OWNER).
I'll go down the rabbithole a bit further and see what I can dig up.

It's hard to say much about this without knowing how you're writing a test - mochitest? mochitest-browser? Something else?
It might make sense to attach your WIP.

Meh. So we call loadURI, and we pass no owner, so we hit this block:
if (!owner && !inheritOwner && !ownerIsExplicit) {
// See if there's system or chrome JS code running
inheritOwner = nsContentUtils::IsCallerChrome();
}
and inheritOwner is set to true. I presume this, at least, answers the question? If not, please re-needinfo (but be quick, because I'm leaving tonight and won't be back until August). If you need someone after my 5pm today, maybe ask :ttaubert or someone else on the frontend team.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Yes, that answers the question. So using nullprincipal in the "is system principal" case with explicitly given owner would actually not break bookmarlets, I guess.

Hey Cody,
Yeah, this is indeed a problem - that's why I had to use setTimeout in my test (see the one attached to this bug).

Bobby actually answered this in [comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=1178058#c40 "RESOLVED FIXED - It's possible to read local files or perform privilege escalation by using a native setter"). I should have looked over his test more in depth.

How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily.

Not really.

All of them.

They should be identical.

This fix has been in Nightly for almost six weeks now, so presumably we'd have heard about addon bustage from any popular addons.
I'm really not worried about addon breakage here. The addon would have to have been written very recently, and basically be explicitly depending on this security flaw.

We're hitting a compile error on mozilla-release, on the relbranch (39.0 based) but not on default (40.0), so something changed between in a cycle. The error is:

Replace the added line:
owner = nsNullPrincipal::Create();
with
owner = do\_CreateInstance("@mozilla.org/nullprincipal;1");
NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE(owner, NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE);

For what it's worth I cannot reproduce this testcase on ESR-31. In the dev-tools console I get

I don't know if the problem can be worked around or if that version of Firefox and/or the PDF reader is missing a crucial feature, but at least the 0-day won't work as written.

There is a test for this ("Tests. v1"), but it was not landed. So somebody needs to run those tests.

Does this mean we could reduce attack surface by re-implementing those HTML elements which are currently implemented using XBL with something possibly safer (e.g. HTML/CSS)? Not an expert here, just wondering :-)

Those technologies aren't really analogous - WebComponents would be the web-y equivalent to XBL, and I'm not sure we've mapped out the steps to ship WebComponent bindings with the browser.
In general, the point of the XBL scope is to hoist in-content XBL code to a place where the content can't see it. In general compromising the XBL scope is not itself a security issue (because it runs with a limited principal), but this bug demonstrates how it can be combined with other exploits.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
