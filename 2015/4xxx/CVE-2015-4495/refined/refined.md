Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the interaction between the same-origin policy implementation and the built-in PDF viewer (PDF.js) in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, it allowed script injection into a non-privileged part of the PDF viewer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Same-origin policy violation:** The core weakness is a failure to properly enforce the same-origin policy, which should isolate scripts from different origins. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a non-privileged part of PDF.js.
*   **Local file access:** The injected script was able to access the local file system, which it should not be permitted to do. This access allows for the theft of sensitive information.
*   **Lack of sufficient input validation:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted JavaScript code and a native setter, suggesting insufficient sanitization of inputs used by the PDF.js component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file theft:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read and steal arbitrary files from the victim's system, including sensitive data like SSH keys, `/etc/passwd`, and other configuration files containing passwords or other credentials.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The ability to inject scripts into the PDF viewer creates a pathway for potential privilege escalation on vulnerable systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious web page:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim in a vulnerable browser, triggers the exploit.
*   **Exploitable PDF documents**: It is likely a malicious PDF document could be crafted to trigger the vulnerability directly when opened by the built-in PDF viewer.
*   **Ad networks:** Exploit has been found in the wild within advertisements served on news websites, further increasing the exposure to this exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, needing to deliver a malicious web page to the victim.
*   **Low skill:** The complexity for exploitation is considered low, meaning that creating an exploit is relatively easy.
*   **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication to be exploited.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit or load the malicious resource containing the crafted exploit.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
*   The targeted files included configuration files for version control systems (subversion), S3 browsers, FTP clients (Filezilla and others), account information (Psi+ and other IM clients), SSH keys, and potentially sensitive text files.
*   The exploit primarily targeted Windows and Linux users; however, Mac users may also be vulnerable via a modified payload.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 39.0.3, Firefox ESR 38.1.1, and Firefox OS 2.2.
*   Patches for various SUSE and Red Hat products were released, and the issue was addressed in openSUSE through package updates.
*   Several related CVEs were fixed alongside CVE-2015-4495 in the same updates.
*   The vulnerability exists within the `pdf.js` component and can be triggered by accessing a malicious pdf through a crafted `embed` or `iframe` tag.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content includes multiple bug reports and mailing list communications, which provide context but do not directly relate to the vulnerability description itself.
*   The descriptions emphasize how the vulnerability allows code to break out of the same-origin policy and access local files, as well as execute code in a non-privileged part of the PDF Viewer.
*   Some of the discussion revolves around the perceived trade-off between security and features, specifically regarding the inclusion of a PDF viewer directly in the browser.
