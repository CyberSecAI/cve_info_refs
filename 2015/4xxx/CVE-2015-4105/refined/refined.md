  "CVE-2015-4105": {
    "description": "Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x enables logging for PCI MSI-X pass-through error messages, which allows local x86 HVM guests to cause a denial of service (host disk consumption) via certain invalid operations.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Xen hypervisor enables logging of PCI MSI-X pass-through error messages triggered by guest VMs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
        "Improper handling of guest-triggered error conditions"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious guest VM can repeatedly trigger error messages, causing excessive disk usage on the host system, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.",
      "attack_vector": "Local access via a malicious guest VM with PCI pass-through enabled.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a malicious HVM guest with the ability to trigger MSI-X errors and the capability to access PCI pass-through devices."

      "Xen versions 3.3 and onwards (specifically up to 4.5.x)",
