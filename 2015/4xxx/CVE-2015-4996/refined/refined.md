- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from IBM Rational ClearQuest's susceptibility to being tricked into connecting to a fake database server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly validate the database server it connects to. This allows an attacker to intercept the connection and obtain database credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the true database server's credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves tricking the software into connecting to a malicious server controlled by the attacker instead of the legitimate database server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to set up a fake database server and redirect the target's connection attempt to it. The CVSS vector indicates that no privileges are needed, no user interaction is required, the scope is unchanged, and only confidentiality is impacted (no integrity or availability issues). However the attack complexity is marked as High.
