- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Maximo Asset Management configuration allows an authenticated user to view backup and debug application files due to a misconfiguration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Misconfiguration leading to exposure of sensitive information through backup and debug application files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated local attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by viewing these files.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user accessing backup and debug application files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
