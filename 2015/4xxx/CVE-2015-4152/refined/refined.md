{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-4152",
      "root_cause": "The Logstash File output plugin allows the use of dynamic field references in the path option, which can be exploited to traverse paths outside the Logstash directory or overwrite files accessible by the Logstash user.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability",
        "Unrestricted file overwrite"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the file system outside of the Logstash directory. Additionally, any file accessible with the permissions of the Logstash user can be overwritten.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through the Logstash File output plugin by exploiting the usage of dynamic field references in the path option."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to configure the Logstash instance and utilize the vulnerable File Output plugin with malicious dynamic field references."
    },
       {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-3120",
      "root_cause": "Logstash 1.4.2 was bundled with Elasticsearch 1.1.1, which had a vulnerability that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host OS using the node client's URL endpoint.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Remote Code Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can use scripts to execute commands on the host OS where Logstash is running.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is the node protocol in the Elasticsearch output plugin, which connects to the Elasticsearch cluster and allows command execution through scripts."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send commands via the Elasticsearch node client."
    },
       {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-3566",
       "root_cause": "The combination of Logstash Forwarder and Lumberjack input/output was vulnerable to the POODLE attack due to the use of the SSLv3 protocol.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "Protocol downgrade attack"
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit the SSLv3 vulnerability, leading to information disclosure. This vulnerability is not directly linked to CVE-2015-4152.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is using the SSLv3 protocol in the Logstash Forwarder and Lumberjack input/output communication."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and force the connection to use SSLv3"
