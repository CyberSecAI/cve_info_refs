Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found in the `admin.php` file of the WP Fastest Cache plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin's `admin.php` file allows execution of functions (`saveOption()`, `deleteCache()`, `deleteCssAndJsCache()`, `addCacheTimeout()`) without proper CSRF protection. This means an attacker can craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can execute these functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the plugin settings via `saveOption()`, delete cached files via `deleteCache()` and `deleteCssAndJsCache()` which could disrupt the website functionality. They could also modify cache timeout settings using `addCacheTimeout()` impacting performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted malicious link or HTML form that exploits the CSRF vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or loading a page containing the malicious form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication to the targeted website.
- However, they need to be able to trick an authenticated user, with administrator privileges, into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form. The attacker does not need to be logged into the admin panel.
