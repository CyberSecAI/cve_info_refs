# Advisory Details

June 24th, 2015
## Panasonic Security API SDK Ipropsapi ActiveX Control GetInfoString Stack Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-259ZDI-CAN-2753

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-4647](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-4647) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Panasonic](http://panasonic.net/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Security API](http://security.panasonic.com/pss/security/library/developer.html#SDK ) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19547']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Panasonic Security API SDK. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists in the GetStringInfo method. By passing a large string to the method, an attacker can cause a fixed-length stack buffer to overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Panasonic has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2015-02-26 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2015-06-24 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## Panasonic Security API SDK Ipropsapi ActiveX Control FilePassword Stack Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-260ZDI-CAN-2752

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-4647](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-4647) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Panasonic](http://panasonic.net/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Security API](http://security.panasonic.com/pss/security/library/developer.html#SDK ) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19546']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Panasonic Security API SDK. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists in the FilePassword property. By setting FilePassword to a very large string, an attacker can cause a fixed-length stack buffer to overflow. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process. |
