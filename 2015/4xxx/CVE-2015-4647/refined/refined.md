The provided content contains two separate advisories, both referencing CVE-2015-4647. It seems that there might be an error, as each advisory describes a distinct vulnerability within the same product. However, since both advisories point to the same CVE, this analysis will treat them as separate vulnerabilities associated with the CVE.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `GetStringInfo` method of the Panasonic Security API SDK Ipropsapi ActiveX control.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** A fixed-length stack buffer is vulnerable to overflowing.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by passing a large string to the vulnerable `GetStringInfo` method. This can be achieved by tricking the target into visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make the target interact with a malicious webpage or file containing the exploit.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `FilePassword` property of the Panasonic Security API SDK Ipropsapi ActiveX control.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** A fixed-length stack buffer is vulnerable to overflowing when the `FilePassword` property is set to a very large string.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by setting the `FilePassword` property to a very large string. This can be achieved by tricking the target into visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make the target interact with a malicious webpage or file containing the exploit.

Both vulnerabilities are related to a stack buffer overflow and lead to remote code execution, and both require user interaction. The vulnerabilities are located in different parts of the Panasonic Security API SDK Ipropsapi ActiveX control (GetStringInfo method and FilePassword property, respectively).
