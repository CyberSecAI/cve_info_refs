**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists within the IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS). The specific root cause is not detailed, but it allows for command execution with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the ability for a local, non-privileged attacker to execute commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the system by executing commands as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system, but does not require any special privileges.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- IBM GPFS V4.1.0.0 through V4.1.0.8
- IBM GPFS V3.5.0.0 through V3.5.0.26
- IBM DB2 pureScale Feature V9.8 on AIX and Linux
- IBM DB2 V10.1 and V10.5 on AIX and Linux when using the pureScale Feature

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is also present in systems where DB2 pureScale is installed on AIX or Linux, as it uses an affected version of GPFS.
- The vulnerability affects multiple editions of DB2.

**Remediation:**
- Apply IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.2 or later.
- Apply IBM GPFS V3.5.0.27 or later.
- For DB2 environments, apply the appropriate fix packs or special builds for the affected versions of DB2.
