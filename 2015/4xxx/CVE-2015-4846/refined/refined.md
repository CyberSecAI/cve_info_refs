Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-4846:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the `afamexts.sql` SQL extension within Oracle E-Business Suite. This extension does not properly filter user-supplied input values, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw, which occurs because the application incorporates unfiltered user inputs directly into SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Retrieval:** Attackers can use the manipulated SQL statements to retrieve sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Maliciously crafted SQL injections allow attackers to modify or alter existing data within the database, which can compromise data integrity.
- **Potential RCE:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, one of the provided sources mentions RCE (Remote Code Execution) as a potential impact alongside SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is via the network, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **User Input Manipulation:** The attack involves altering the strings within the SQL statement via user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to the APPS account, (e.g., the default credentials APPS/APPS) in order to exploit the vulnerability successfully.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable SQL extension:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable SQL extension (afamexts.sql) and how to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle E-Business Suite versions 12.1.3 and 12.1.4, and possibly other versions as well.
- The vulnerability is patched in the Oracle CPU October 2015.
- The CVSS score is 3.6, with Access Complexity: High and Authentication: Single.
- The impact of the vulnerability includes partial compromise of confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on availability.
