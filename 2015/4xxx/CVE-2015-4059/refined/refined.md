Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of HTTP requests by the `LicenseServer.exe` application. Specifically, when processing large HTTP headers, the application performs an unsafe memory block copy operation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Heap buffer overflow: The application doesn't properly validate the size of incoming HTTP headers, resulting in a buffer overflow during the memory copy operation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable machine. This grants the attacker complete control over the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `LicenseServer.exe` application, which listens by default on port 4420.
    *   Remote: The attacker can be located remotely.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server on port 4420.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP request with oversized headers.
    *   No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was disclosed publicly without a patch initially due to lack of vendor response.
* The vendor later released a patch (Emulation License Server version 4.3.006) to address the vulnerability.
* The provided content includes a mitigation strategy involving restricting access to the service using firewall rules/whitelisting.

This content provides more details than a typical CVE description, including the specific location of the vulnerability (HTTP header parsing in LicenseServer.exe), the nature of the memory corruption (heap buffer overflow), and details about the vendor's response (or lack thereof) to the report.
