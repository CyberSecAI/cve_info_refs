Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-4065:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_GET['post']`) within an iframe's `src` attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when the affected page is viewed. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that injects malicious javascript into the `post` parameter of the `http://[domain]/wp-admin/post-new.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `shared/shortcodes/inbound-shortcodes.php` at line 761:
```php
<iframe src='<?php echo INBOUDNOW_SHARED_URLPATH . 'shortcodes/'; ?>preview.php?sc=&post=<?php echo $_GET['post']; ?>' width="285" scrollbar='true' frameborder="0" id="inbound-shortcodes-preview"></iframe>
```
The `$_GET['post']` parameter is directly inserted into the `src` attribute of the iframe without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code within the `post` parameter, which will then be executed when the iframe is loaded.

**Exploit example:**
```
http://[domain]/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=inbound-forms&post='></iframe><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88, 83, 83))</script>
```
This URL injects the following HTML: `'></iframe><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88, 83, 83))</script>`, which breaks out of the iframe and executes the Javascript alert popup.

The identified vulnerability is present in the WordPress plugin "Landing Pages" version 1.8.4.
The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.5.
