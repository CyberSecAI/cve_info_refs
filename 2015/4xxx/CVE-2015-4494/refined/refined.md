Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check on WiFi Direct system messages in Firefox OS. Specifically, system messages related to WiFi Direct were being broadcast without ensuring that the receiving application had the necessary "wifi-manage" permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper check to verify if an application is authorized to receive WiFi Direct system messages. This allows any application, regardless of its permission level, to listen to these messages.
- **Information Disclosure:** The system messages could potentially contain information that, if intercepted, might pose a privacy risk. Although the impact was deemed low, the potential for extracting "limited information" was present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Issue:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to a privacy breach, as unprivileged applications could gain access to WiFi Direct system messages, which could contain sensitive or identifying data.
- **Limited Information Disclosure:** The severity was considered low because the information obtained was limited and likely required specific conditions to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** An attacker could create a malicious application that listens for the improperly broadcasted WiFi Direct system messages.
- **Installed Application:** Any application installed on the device could exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** This vulnerability does not require user interaction beyond the installation of the malicious application, given that any app could listen to system messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Application Installation:** The attacker needs to be able to install a malicious application on the vulnerable Firefox OS device.
- **No Elevated Privileges Needed:** The attacker does not require any elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Proximity:** It can be assumed that a proximity to a device is needed for the application to receive wifi-related messages.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Paul Theriault of Mozilla.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox OS 2.2 and backported to versions 2.0, 2.0M, 2.1, and 2.1S. Version 1.4 was marked as wontfix.
- The fix involved implementing the appropriate permission check on the system messages.
- The vulnerability was classified as a "sec-moderate" issue by the security team, and it was publicly disclosed.
