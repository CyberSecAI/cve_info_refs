Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) B-Series blade servers. A specific condition allows an unauthenticated, local attacker to trigger a hang of the host operating system or the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a lack of proper input validation or error handling when processing local requests or events. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The specific trigger is not detailed in this advisory.
*   CWE-399: Resource Management Errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service. The affected blade server's host operating system or BMC will hang, causing a loss of availability.
*  The system will become unresponsive, requiring a power cycle of the blade to resolve the issue and in some cases, a reset of the slot.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **local**.  An attacker needs local access to the affected Cisco UCS B-Series blade server to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker is unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the targeted Cisco UCS B-Series blade server. No authentication is required.

**CVSS Metrics**

*   **Base Score:** 4.9
    *   **AV:L** (Access Vector: Local)
    *   **AC:L** (Access Complexity: Low)
    *  **Au:N** (Authentication: None)
    *   **C:N** (Confidentiality Impact: None)
    *   **I:N** (Integrity Impact: None)
    *   **A:C** (Availability Impact: Complete)
*  **Temporal Score:** 4.0
    *   **E:F** (Exploitability: Functional)
    *   **RL:OF** (Remediation Level: Official Fix)
    *   **RC:C** (Report Confidence: Confirmed)

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco UCS B200 M3 Blade Server
*   Cisco UCS B420 M3 Blade Server
*   Cisco UCS B22 M3 Blade Server
*   Cisco UCS B260 M4 Blade Server
*   Cisco UCS B460 M4 Blade Server
   *All running Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Server Software prior to release 2.2.6

**Mitigation:**

*  The recommended fix is to upgrade to Cisco UCS B-Series Blade Server Software Release 2.2.6 or later.
*   As a workaround, If CIMC connection is still available, resetting the blade power will recover the blade. Otherwise, resetting the blade slot will recover the blade.
