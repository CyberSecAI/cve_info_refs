Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization of the "server" HTTP GET parameter within the `/monitor/show_sys_state.php` script. This lack of proper filtering allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By manipulating the "server" parameter, an attacker can inject and execute malicious SQL queries against the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Compromise:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow the attacker to read, insert, and modify arbitrary data within the database.
*   **Web Application Takeover:** The ability to manipulate the database can lead to full compromise of the web application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain administrative control.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  The attacker could steal sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable parameter via an HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:**  Initially, the attacker needs to be authenticated and possess "monitor" privileges. However, the advisory notes that, when combined with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2015-4119), the SQL injection becomes exploitable by remote, unauthenticated attackers.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The provided exploit example demonstrates how to inject `UNION SELECT 1,version()` in order to retrieve the database version.
*   The advisory also notes that the application is vulnerable to CSRF (CVE-2015-4119), which can be used in conjunction with the SQL injection vulnerability to amplify the impact.
