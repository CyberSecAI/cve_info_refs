Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2015-4645**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `read_fragment_table_4` function within `unsquash-4.c`. Specifically, the `bytes` variable, calculated using `SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_BYTES(sBlk.s.fragments)`, can overflow, leading to an undersized memory allocation for `fragment_table`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:** The `bytes` variable, an integer, overflows when `SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_BYTES(sBlk.s.fragments)` results in a value larger than the maximum value that an integer can hold, thus causing a smaller memory allocation
    *   **Stack Overflow (Indirect):** Although the initial issue is an integer overflow, this leads to a subsequent stack overflow. After the erroneous memory allocation, the code attempts to read data from the squashfs image into this undersized `fragment_table_index` VLA, which leads to stack overflow. The stack overflow occurs because `fragment_table_index[]` is allocated on the stack using Variable Length Arrays (VLA), and its size can exceed the stack limits (RLIMIT_STACK), especially with crafted inputs, when coupled with the read_fs_bytes function call that initiates the transfer from the squashfs image to the stack.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the `fragments` value from the superblock, allowing a maliciously crafted squashfs image to trigger the overflow.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow causes a crash of the `unsquashfs` application, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, a stack overflow vulnerability is in theory capable of leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious Squashfs image with a specific value for `sBlk.s.fragments`.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to extract the content of the malicious Squashfs image using `unsquashfs`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Squashfs image to the user.
    *   The user must then attempt to process the crafted squashfs image using a vulnerable version of `unsquashfs`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The issue is also present in other `read_fragment_table_N` functions, and the original `squashfs-tools`.
*   A proposed fix is to avoid using Variable Length Arrays (VLA) and use heap allocation for `fragment_table_index`.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in commit `f95864a` of `plougher/squashfs-tools`, which not only fixes the overflows but adds additional checks on the filesystem super-block tables.
*   The fix includes sanity checks of the superblock to reject corrupted filesystems before memory allocation, variables being increased in size to `long long`, and using a shared, heap allocated buffer to read table indexes.

**Summary of fixes in commit f95864a:**
1. Filesystem super-block tables are checked to match values across the filesystem, trapping corrupted filesystems
2. Variables increased from int to `long long` to handle larger table sizes
3. Stack allocation removed, using shared heap-allocated buffer to read table indexes.

**CVE-2015-4646**

*   This CVE is related to the same issue but affects `unsquash-1.c`, `unsquash-2.c`, `unsquash-3.c`, and `unsquash-4.c`.
*   It also stems from a lack of input validation allowing crafted input to cause a crash.
*   It shares the same patch as CVE-2015-4645.
