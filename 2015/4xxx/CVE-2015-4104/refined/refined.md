Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-4104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The QEMU Xen code does not properly restrict access to PCI MSI mask bits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper restriction of access to PCI MSI mask bits.
*   Exposure of PCI MSI mask bits to guest VMs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS) in the form of unexpected interrupts leading to a host crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local x86 HVM guest users, through a malicious guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A malicious guest user within an x86 HVM guest.
*   The guest must have access to a physical PCI device (PCI passthrough).
*   The passed-through PCI device must be MSI-capable.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   This issue is present in Xen versions 3.3.x through 4.5.x.
*   ARM systems are not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is only applicable when the device model is running in Dom0 (for xl, this can be avoided by using `device_model_stubdomain_override=1`).
*   The vulnerability is only applicable when the passed-through PCI devices are MSI-capable.
*   SUSE rates this vulnerability as "important".

The provided content gives more details than the original CVE description, especially in regards to specific requirements such as the need for PCI passthrough and details about where the device model must be run. Also details on vulnerable versions of Xen and that ARM systems are not affected.
