Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper neutralization of user-submitted content within the Cloud4wi Splash Portal application. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied data is included in the page output without adequate sanitization. Specifically, the `recoveryMessage` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within the user's browser. This can have various impacts, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the web application
  - Stealing sensitive information
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `recoveryMessage` parameter in the URL to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to click the malicious link. This could be achieved through phishing, social engineering, or other means.
- The attacker does not need any special access or privileges on the target system.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists on the "Forgot your credentials?" page.
- When a user submits a request with an invalid username, the server returns an error message in the URL via `recoveryMessage` parameter.
- The vulnerability is demonstrated with the following payload injected into the URL `recoveryMessage` parameter: `Invalid%20username”);><script>alert(“XSS”);</script>`.

**Solution:**
- The vendor recommends updating to version 5.9.7, which fixes the issue.
