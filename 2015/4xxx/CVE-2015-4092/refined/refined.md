The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-2282 and CVE-2015-2278, but does not mention CVE-2015-4092.

The content does describe two specific vulnerabilities related to the LZC/LZH compression algorithms:

**1. Stack-based overflow vulnerability (CVE-2015-2282) in the LZC compression algorithm:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `CsDecomprLZC` function. The code uses a `while` loop to generate output characters in reverse order, where the variable `code` contains an attacker-controlled value. If this value, and the value of the code in the prefix table are greater than 256, it can lead to a stack overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper bounds checking on the 'code' variable when processing compressed data, leading to a stack overflow.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by controlling the values stored in the prefix and suffix tables to overwrite the stack.
*   **Attack vector:** By providing a specially crafted compressed data stream with specific values in the prefix and suffix tables, attackers can cause a stack overflow.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted input to a system using the vulnerable LZC compression algorithm.

**2. Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2015-2278) in the LZH compression algorithm:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is in the `BuildHufTree` function where arrays 'e' and 'd' are indexed by attacker controlled values. The arrays are not validated against the allowed bounds which allows a read outside of the buffer.
*   **Weakness:** The code uses attacker controlled values to index into arrays 'e' and 'd' without proper bounds checks leading to out of bounds reads.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read data stored outside the buffer using crafted package data which can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Attack vector:** An attacker can exploit this issue by crafting a special package containing malicious data.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted input to a system using the vulnerable LZH compression algorithm.
