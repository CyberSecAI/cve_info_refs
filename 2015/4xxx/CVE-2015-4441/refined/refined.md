- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Bypassing restrictions on JavaScript API execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows for bypassing restrictions on JavaScript API execution.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute malicious JavaScript code, possibly leading to further exploitation, such as information disclosure, privilege escalation, or even code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting a weakness in the way JavaScript API execution is restricted. This would likely require a specially crafted document or interaction within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to supply the malicious PDF to the application for viewing and/or interaction. This could be done via email or hosting it on a website.
