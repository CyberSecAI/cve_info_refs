Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-4870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2015-4870 is an unspecified vulnerability within the parsing component of the MySQL server. This vulnerability stems from how the MariaDB/MySQL server processes SQL queries, specifically related to the `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` function. The vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed or specially crafted SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unspecified Parsing Flaw:** The core weakness lies in a parsing flaw that is not described in detail, which affects how the MariaDB/MySQL server handles certain SQL queries. 
*   **Malformed SQL Queries:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending specially crafted or malformed SQL queries that include the `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a Denial of Service, causing the MySQL server to hang or crash repeatedly.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Some sources suggest a *potential* for arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed.
*   **Availability Impact:** The vulnerability primarily affects the availability of the database server by causing it to crash or hang.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network via multiple protocols.
*   **SQL Injection:** A likely attack vector involves using SQL injection to insert a crafted `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` statement within an SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Exploitation generally requires an authenticated user on the MySQL server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the MariaDB/MySQL server.
*   **Ability to execute SQL queries**: The attacker must be able to send or inject a crafted SQL query that includes a malformed `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in MariaDB and MySQL versions prior to the specific fixes.
*   Several sources mention that this CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in Oracle Critical Patch Updates.
*   The fix typically involves upgrading the affected packages to the latest versions.

The provided content highlights that the vulnerability is present in:
*   Oracle MySQL Server 5.5.45 and earlier, and 5.6.26 and earlier
*   MariaDB 10.0.21, 10.0.22, and 5.5.46 releases and prior

The fix for this vulnerability is typically included in the security updates provided by the different vendors (Red Hat, SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) in their respective advisories.
