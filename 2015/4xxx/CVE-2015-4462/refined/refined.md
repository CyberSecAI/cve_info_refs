The provided content describes a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in eFront CMS v3.6.15.4, which is the subject of CVE-2015-4462.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "files from remote url" feature in the file upload functionality. The application incorrectly accepts local file paths as valid URLs, allowing a user to specify a path to a file on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the input provided in the `url_upload` parameter, allowing an attacker to include local files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system. For instance, the attacker could access sensitive configuration files, log files, or even source code.
- The attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information, such as database credentials or cryptographic keys.
- The attacker can copy the content of the file to a location within the web server accessible via the web.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `professor.php` script with the `ctg` parameter set to `file_manager`.
- The `url_upload` parameter is used to specify a local file path on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a Professor role account in the eFront CMS.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the local path of the files they want to access on the server.
