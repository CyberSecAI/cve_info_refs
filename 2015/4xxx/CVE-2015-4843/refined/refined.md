  "CVE-2015-4843": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflow issues were found in the implementation of Buffers in the java.nio (Non-blocking I/O) packages in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. These could lead to out of bounds buffer access and Java Virtual Machine memory corruption. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to run arbitrary code with the Java Virtual Machine privileges or bypass Java sandbox restrictions.",
