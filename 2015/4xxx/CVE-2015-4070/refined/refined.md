Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4070:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wowproxy.php` file in the `wow-moodboard-lite` WordPress plugin does not require authentication to proxy images. It directly redirects the user to a URL provided in the `url` parameter via POST or GET request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The plugin allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL. This is because the `proxyimages` function takes the user-provided `url` parameter and directly uses it in a `Location` header, resulting in an unvalidated redirect.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The `wowproxy.php` file does not perform any authentication, allowing anyone to trigger the redirect.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could craft a malicious link using the vulnerable `wowproxy.php` endpoint and trick users into visiting a phishing site designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** The open redirect could be used to direct users to sites hosting malicious software.
- **Social Engineering Attacks:** The redirect could be used to craft social engineering attacks that rely on the user trusting the initial link.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a URL with a `url` parameter pointing to a malicious website and tricking a user to click it.
- Both GET and POST requests can be used to provide the URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to know the location of the `wowproxy.php` file within the WordPress plugin.
- The attacker only needs the ability to craft a malicious link and distribute it to potential victims.

**Additional notes:**
- The plugin has been closed due to this security issue.
- The exploit code example provided in the advisory is not for this vulnerability, but another vulnerability in a different plugin (`adsense-click-fraud-monitoring`).
