Subject: Re: [saltstack-security] CVE Request / Saltstack SSL verification
 disabling for alibabab cloud module

CVE was assigned off list:

CVE-2015-4017 -- Certificates are not verified when connecting to server in
the Aliyun and Proxmox modules

And fixed in the just-released 2014.7.6:

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/8Kv1bytGD6c>

The splunk module vulnerability was not in a released version of salt, so
there is no CVE for that module. It was fixed before the 2015.5.0 release.

Please note that we have a responsible disclosure policy, and would
appreciate it if it were followed in the future:
