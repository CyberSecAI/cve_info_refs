{
  "CVE-2015-4163": {
    "Description": "GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref in Xen 4.2 through 4.5 does not check the grant table operation version, which allows local guest domains to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a hypercall without a GNTTABOP_setup_table or GNTTABOP_set_version.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref hypercall lacks a version check, leading to incorrect behavior when called without prior GNTTABOP_setup_table or GNTTABOP_set_version calls.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing version check in the GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref hypercall handler.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious or buggy guest kernel can cause a denial of service affecting the entire system through a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious or buggy guest domain kernels.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest domain."
