Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4176:

**1. Verification:**

The content from multiple sources (kernel.org commit, RedHat bugzilla, openwall, and Github) directly refer to the following commit as a fix: `e0c9c0afd2fc958ffa34b697972721d81df8a56f`. This commit addresses a vulnerability related to unmounting and data exposure, aligning with the CVE description "deletion of a file or directory could trigger an unmount and reveal data under a mount point".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue stems from the way `umount(MNT_DETACH)` was implemented in conjunction with user namespaces. Specifically, when a mount point was lazily unmounted using  `MNT_DETACH`,  the individual mounts within the mount tree could become disconnected. This disconnection led to the potential exposure of underlying data if a file or directory was deleted under a mount point. The vulnerability was present because the mount tree was not properly kept connected during the lazy unmount.
When a file or directory was deleted within a lazily unmounted tree, a new, unexpected unmount could be triggered that revealed files under the mount point.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Mount Tree Handling:** The lazy unmount mechanism did not properly maintain the relationships between mounts in a tree structure when `MNT_DETACH` flag was used.
- **Data Exposure:** This improper handling of mount trees led to a vulnerability where data could be revealed by triggering an unmount.
- **Unintended Unmount:** Deleting a file or directory was inadvertently able to trigger an unmount operation, which should not have happened, revealing the underlying mount point data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** A local attacker could potentially access sensitive information by deleting a file or directory, which would trigger the unmount and expose the data beneath the mount point.
- **Privilege Escalation:** As noted by Eric Biederman in the openwall mail excerpt, a user with uid 0 inside a user namespace (like a container) without capabilities could exploit this to access files in the host namespace.
- **Unintended Access:** A user could gain access to files that are hidden under the mount point that they would not otherwise have access to, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack is local and can be triggered by a user with the ability to delete files and directories.
- **File/Directory Deletion:** The specific attack vector is deleting files or directories within a lazily unmounted mount tree.
- **User Namespaces:** The vulnerability is more pronounced when user namespaces are enabled, as it allows unprivileged users to trigger the issue.
- **`umount(MNT_DETACH)`:** The vulnerability relies on the use of the `MNT_DETACH` flag with the `umount` system call to lazily unmount a mount tree.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **Unprivileged access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to delete files and directories within a mount point that's a part of a lazily unmounted tree.
- **User namespaces:** The attack is easier to trigger from within user namespaces as this enables unprivileged users to perform the actions that expose this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

The commit `e0c9c0afd2fc958ffa34b697972721d81df8a56f` includes a new flag `UMOUNT_CONNECTED`. This flag addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that even when a mount is lazily unmounted, the individual mounts within the tree remain connected. The commit also modified `detach_mounts` to use this flag in order to fix the specific vulnerability.
The openwall mailing list discussion highlights the severity of this issue when combined with user namespaces because it can be triggered with a simple delete operation by an unprivileged user.
RedHat Bugzilla marks this vulnerability as "NOTABUG", this is likely because the fix was implemented in the kernel and no further actions were needed from a security perspective within the product. The core issue, not being present in the stable releases, is what makes this "NOTABUG".

In summary, CVE-2015-4176 was a serious vulnerability that exposed data due to an improper handling of mount points when combined with lazy unmounts using user namespaces. The fix included in commit `e0c9c0afd2fc958ffa34b697972721d81df8a56f` addresses the issue by maintaining mount connectivity and therefore preventing unintended unmounts and data leakage.
