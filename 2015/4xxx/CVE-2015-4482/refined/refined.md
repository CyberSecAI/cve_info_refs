{
  "CVE-2015-4482": {
    "Description": "mar_read.c in the Updater in Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.2 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted name of a Mozilla Archive (aka MAR) file.",
    "Root cause": "The length of the name of a file inside a MAR archive is stored as a signed integer, and is obtained by subtracting one pointer from another. If the result of the subtraction is larger than the max positive value of a signed int, then a negative value will be passed to malloc resulting in an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can gain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) if they can run the updater with a crafted name of a MAR file.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by running the updater with a specially crafted MAR file name.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute the updater and supply a specially crafted MAR file on a local system."
