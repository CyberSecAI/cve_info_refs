  "content": [
    {
      "nature": "vulnerability",
      "root_cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way PHP's Phar extension parsed Phar archives due to a missing check for a null byte in the filename. Specifically, when the entry filename starts with a NULL byte, an integer underflow occurs, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during the parsing of a tar archive.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer underflow",
        "Out-of-bounds memory access",
        "Memory Corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted archive could cause PHP to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PHP application.",
      "attack_vector": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted Phar archive.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a Phar archive and to have a PHP application open the crafted archive."
    },
        {
      "nature": "patch",
      "details": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to prevent a null byte from being the first character of a filename, thus preventing the underflow."
