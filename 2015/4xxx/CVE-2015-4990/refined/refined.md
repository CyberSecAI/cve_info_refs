- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience portal allows user authentication via an unencrypted GET request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication credentials can be exposed due to the use of unencrypted GET requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local privileged user could obtain the authentication credentials of other users when they connect to the system in a specific way.
- **Attack vectors**: A local privileged user can potentially eavesdrop or intercept the unencrypted GET requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local privileged user and must be able to observe the network traffic or access the system where the vulnerable application is running. Additionally, the victim user must connect in a specific way which is not defined in the advisory, implying a specific authentication process that is vulnerable.
