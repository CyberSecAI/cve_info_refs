  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can add an admin user to the application, potentially gaining full control over the system. Additionally, they can reset passwords for existing users after gaining administrative access.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, sends a request to the vulnerable application. This crafted request can add an admin user or reset user passwords without the admin's knowledge or consent. The attacker then uses social engineering to trick the administrator into accessing the malicious page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a web server to serve the malicious HTML page. They also require a way to entice the application's administrator to click on a link to the page while the admin is logged into the application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application to execute the attack."
