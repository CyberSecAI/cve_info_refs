{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the application.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious check plugin",
    "Host profile description",
     "Test service check command line"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. The attacker needs to have the ability to create and modify check plugins, host profiles, and test service checks."
