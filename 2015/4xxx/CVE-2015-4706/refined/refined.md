Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how IPython handled JSON error responses in its REST API. Specifically, URL parameters were being included in the error messages. These error messages were incorrectly served with a `text/html` content type instead of the correct `application/json` type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By injecting malicious code into URL parameters, an attacker could have that code executed within the context of a user's browser when the error message was displayed.
*   **Incorrect Content Type:** Serving JSON responses with the `text/html` content type instead of `application/json` is a key contributing factor, as it allows the browser to interpret the included URL parameters as HTML and execute scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   Steal cookies or session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
*   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   Perform other actions within the context of the user's session, depending on the notebook's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with XSS payload embedded in its parameters. This URL would then trigger an error response from the IPython server.
*   The attacker would need to induce a user to visit this crafted malicious URL, which could be done through various social engineering means (e.g. phishing) or by tricking a user to click on a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the server.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to make the target user visit a specially crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that error responses are sent with the `application/json` content type, thus preventing the browser from interpreting the URL parameters as executable code.
*  The provided content also details the fix, which involved changes to `IPython/html/base/handlers.py` and other handler files, which now ensure correct header settings and the use of `APIHandler` class for API endpoints, setting the Content-Security-Policy for API handlers.
* The vulnerability was present in versions of IPython 2.x and 3.x, which were fixed in versions 3.2 and later.
*   The fixes involve setting the correct `Content-Type` header to `application/json` when an error occurs, as well as adjusting Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for the API handlers for further security.
