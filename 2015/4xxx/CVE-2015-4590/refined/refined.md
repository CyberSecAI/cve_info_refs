  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2015-4590",
    "description": "The extractFrom function in Internals/QuotedString.cpp in Arduino JSON before 4.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a JSON string with a \\ (backslash) followed by a terminator, as demonstrated by \"\\\\0\", which triggers a buffer overflow and over-read.",
    "root_cause": "The `extractFrom` function in `QuotedString.cpp` does not properly handle escaped characters at the end of a quoted string, causing it to miss the null terminator check.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted JSON string with a backslash followed by a terminator (e.g., '\\\\0').",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JSON string to be parsed by the vulnerable code.",
     "details": [
        "The vulnerability occurs within the `extractFrom` function which is responsible for extracting quoted strings, handling escape sequences. The function iterates through the input character by character, looking for the closing quote. However, it does not handle the case where a backslash `\\` (used for escaping) immediately precedes a null terminator `\\0`. The logic processes the backslash, then advances the pointer to process the escaped character. The issue arises when the escaped character is the null terminator; the function does not check for the null terminator after processing the backslash, thus leading the read pointer to move past the end of the string. This results in both a buffer over-read and write potentially leading to memory corruption.",
         "The provided example input `{\"       3                v                    3                                  K\\\\\\0` demonstrates the vulnerability. The relevant part is the quoted string ending with `K\\\\\\0`. When processing this, the parser encounters `\\\\` , which it correctly treats as a single escaped `\\` character. However, it reads past the null terminator, since the null check is performed before processing a backslash. The subsequent attempt to read past the null terminator causes a buffer over-read, leading to a crash."
