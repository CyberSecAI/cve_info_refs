## CVE-2015-4507

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `SavedStacks` class within the JavaScript implementation of Mozilla Firefox. This flaw is triggered when the Debugger API is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of `SavedStacks` in the JavaScript implementation when the Debugger API is enabled.
- This leads to an assertion failure (`getSlotRef` assertion failure).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to application exit.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted website.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the usage of the Debugger API and `SavedStacks` within the crafted website's JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and persuade a user to visit the site while using the Debugger API.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox versions prior to 41.0.
- The severity of the issue is rated as moderate by SUSE, with a CVSS v2 base score of 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).

This information provides more details than the original CVE description, specifying the location of the vulnerability in the JavaScript implementation of the browser, its connection to the debugger, and that this is exploitable using a crafted website.
