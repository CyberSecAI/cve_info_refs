      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires local access to the system.",
    "details": "The provided information states that this vulnerability exists within the Database Scheduler component, and while it is not remotely exploitable without authentication, successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The access complexity is low. This means an attacker with local access to the vulnerable system could potentially execute arbitrary code. The CVSS score was modified from the initial release, indicating a change in the assessed severity or risk."
