Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-4946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper permission checks within the IBM Rational LifeCycle Project Administration component. This allows an authenticated attacker to perform unauthorized actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient access control: Authenticated users can execute actions beyond their intended permission level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can perform actions that they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact is not detailed but suggests potential for unauthorized modification or manipulation of project data/settings. The CVSS score indicates Low impact on Integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker would likely need local access to the system or an account within the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (PR:L) of the affected application. No user interaction (UI:N) is required, and scope is unchanged (S:U). The attacker requires local access (AV:L).
