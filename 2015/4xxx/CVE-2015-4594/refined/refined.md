{
  "CVE-2015-4594": {
    "description": "The web application is vulnerable to session fixation attacks. When authenticating a user the application does not assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to generate a new session ID upon user authentication.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Session Fixation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can hijack a user's session by providing a pre-existing session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid session ID and then trick the user into authenticating with that ID.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to a pre-existing session ID, and be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, or somehow deliver a crafted link to the user. The attacker must also be able to entice a user to authenticate using this pre-existing session ID."
