Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4001:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Integer signedness error in the `oz_hcd_get_desc_cnf` function within the OZWPAN driver in the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The `required_size` variable and `copy_len` are declared as signed integers. When `offset` exceeds required_size an integer underflow can happen. This allows for `memcpy` with a negative size which can result in an arbitrary out-of-bounds write.
- The patch changes data types to `unsigned int` to prevent the underflow and out-of-bounds memory copy.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  Denial of service (system crash)
- Potential arbitrary code execution due to out-of-bounds memory write via a crafted packet.

**Attack vectors:**

- Remote attacker can send a crafted network packet.
- Vulnerability lies within the `oz_hcd_get_desc_cnf` function in `drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozhcd.c`.
- The specific vulnerability is triggered by an offset value in a crafted packet causing a negative `memcpy` size.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted packet to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in the `drivers/staging/ozwpan` subsystem of the Linux kernel.
- The issue is in the handling of sizes/offsets within a network packet leading to a negative value being passed to `memcpy`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely using a crafted packet.
