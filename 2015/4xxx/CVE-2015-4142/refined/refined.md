  "CVE-2015-4142": {
    "description": "Integer underflow in the WMM Action frame parser in hostapd 0.5.5 through 2.4 and wpa_supplicant 0.7.0 through 2.4, when used for AP mode MLME/SME functionality, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted frame, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an integer underflow when calculating the length of the information element part of a WMM Action frame. The frame length is verified to be large enough to include the 802.11 header but the additional bytes after the header are not explicitly verified. Removing header length from the total frame length results in a negative signed integer that is interpreted as a very large unsigned integer. This results in a buffer read overflow.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker within radio range of an access point using vulnerable versions of hostapd or wpa_supplicant for MLME/SME operations. Specifically, they must send a crafted WMM Action frame. AP mode or P2P GO mode must be enabled at runtime."
