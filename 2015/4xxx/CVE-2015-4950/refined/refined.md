Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for Microsoft Exchange, Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange, and FastBack for Microsoft Exchange handle mailbox aliases during restore operations. When multiple mailboxes share the same alias, the software may incorrectly identify the target mailbox during restores, leading to data exposure or incorrect data placement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Alias Handling:** The software uses mailbox aliases for identification during restore operations, without validating the uniqueness of these aliases.
*   **Data Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a user to restore the contents of one mailbox into a different, unintended mailbox when aliases are duplicated.
*  **Incorrect Mailbox History:** The mailbox history may not correctly represent the mailboxes that share the same alias.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** An attacker could gain access to confidential data by restoring one mailbox's data into another mailbox which they have access to.
*   **Data Corruption/Loss:**  Data could be incorrectly restored into the wrong mailbox, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires a local user with sufficient privileges to initiate a mailbox restore.
*   **Manipulating Mailbox Names:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by having access to accounts that have duplicated aliases

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user with privileges to use the affected software.
*   **Knowledge of Aliases:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the existence of duplicated mailbox aliases.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple IBM products: Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager, Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail (Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange), and Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange.
*   Workarounds involve using the CLI with mailbox GUIDs or display names, or renaming duplicated aliases using Exchange management tools.
*   Patches are available for all affected products, with specific versions identified for each.
*  The issue affects the mailbox restore browser interface, CLI restores and potentially the "Open Mailbox" function.
