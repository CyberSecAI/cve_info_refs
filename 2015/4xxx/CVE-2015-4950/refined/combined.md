## Workarounds and Mitigations

For the products:

- Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager: FlashCopy Manager for Microsoft Exchange

- Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange

two workarounds exist for this problem:

1) Use the CLI interface to restore the mailbox by specifying mailbox GUID or display name instead of the alias.

2) Use the Microsoft Exchange Management Console or Powershell commands to rename the duplicated mailbox alias to a unique value

For the product:

- Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange

three workarounds exist for this problem:

1)) Open a PST file and restore messages to the PST file. Then, import the PST file contents into the mailbox.

2) Restore messages using the "SMTP Restore" option

3) Use the Microsoft Exchange Management Console or Powershell commands to rename the duplicated mailbox alias to a unique value.

## Error description

* ```
  *VULNERABILITY SUMMARY*

  In environments with duplicated mailbox aliases, FlashCopy
  Manager for Microsoft Exchange and Data Protection for
  Microsoft Exchange may open and restore the wrong
  mailbox.

  *VULNERABILITY DETAILS*

  IBM Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager, Tivoli Storage Manager for
  Mail, and Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack for Microsoft Exchange
  could allow a local user with elevated privileges to obtain
  sensitive information by manipulating mailbox names that share
  the same alias.

  For example:

  Mailbox Display Name Alias
  mailbox1             Sales
  mailbox2             sales

  When two mailboxes have the same alias, users may encounter the
  following problems when using affected software:

  - the Mailbox Restore Browser interface may populate mailboxes
  with the folders and messages from a different mailbox than
  the one intended

  - restoring a mailbox via the CLI interface, using the alias
  instead of the mailbox display name, may restore a different
  mailbox than the one intended

  the mailbox history may not correctly represent the mailboxes
  that share the same alias

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  Use the Exchange Management Console or Powershell commands to
  rename the duplicated mailbox alias to a unique value.

  ```
