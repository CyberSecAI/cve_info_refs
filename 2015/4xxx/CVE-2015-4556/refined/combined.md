Hello CHICKEN users,

Using gcc's Address Sanitizer, it was discovered that the string-translate*
procedure from the data-structures unit can scan beyond the input string's
length up to the length of the source strings in the map that's passed to
string-translate*.  This issue was fixed in master 8a46020, and it will
make its way into CHICKEN 4.10.

This bug is present in all released versions of CHICKEN.

There is no known workaround, except applying the patch posted in the
following chicken-hackers thread:
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2015-06/msg00037.html>

Kind regards,
The CHICKEN Team

```

Hello everyone,

I decided to run a "make check" with the Address Sanitizer in gcc turned
on (libasan, -fsanitize=address) after a colleague told me about this
(hi, Lekensteyn!) and this found a bug in string-translate* which is very
similar to the bug we recently found in substring-index: it would start
scanning the provided string from each index, completely disregarding the
length of the source string in the map.

This is a very tricky bug to detect manually, because memcmp will stop
scanning as soon as it hits a different byte, which means that it would
scan at most one byte in the overwhelmingly common case, but occasionally
it would scan more than the one byte.

The attached patch fixes the bug by checking the lengths of the strings
and simply avoids calling C_substring_compare if the searched-for string
is larger than the remaining part of the argument string at index.
I've also added a few basic tests, just in case; I was unsuccessful in
crafting a test that would trigger an error or segfault in unpatched
CHICKENs, due to the aforementioned situation of memcmp stopping early.

I think this patch should go into all 3 active branches (master,
prerelease and chicken-5).  Once applied, I'll send out an announcement
and request a CVE, as usual.

Cheers,
Peter

### Background

Chicken is a scheme interpreter and native scheme to C compiler.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chicken. Please review

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chicken users should upgrade to the latest version:
