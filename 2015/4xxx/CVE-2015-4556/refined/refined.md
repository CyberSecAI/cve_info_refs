Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-4556:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `string-translate*` procedure of the CHICKEN Scheme's data-structures unit. The procedure performs a comparison using `memcmp` on every index of the input string with the source strings in the provided map, without checking if the length of the source string exceeds the remaining part of the input string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `string-translate*` procedure attempts to read beyond the bounds of the input string. Specifically, it scans for the source strings provided in the map argument, from each position within the input string, without ensuring that the comparison does not extend beyond the actual end of the input string. The `memcmp` function will stop when it hits a different byte, and may only scan one byte in most cases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Although the `memcmp` function will often stop quickly when it encounters a mismatching byte, it may read a small amount of memory out of bounds which could potentially expose parts of memory.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not described as a primary impact, a sufficiently large read might cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):**  The Gentoo security advisory notes that "the worst of which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code." However, the details in the other sources do not explicitly describe how arbitrary code execution could occur, so it is likely a consequence of memory corruption due to the out-of-bounds read, rather than direct code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a crafted input string and a map of source strings to `string-translate*`, an attacker could trigger the out-of-bounds read. The vulnerability is present in all released versions of CHICKEN prior to 4.10.0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to supply input to the vulnerable `string-translate*` function. This means being able to execute code within the context of an application using the CHICKEN Scheme.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was discovered using gcc's Address Sanitizer.
- The vulnerability is similar to another bug found in `substring-index`.
- A patch was created that fixes this issue by checking the lengths of the strings before comparing using `C_substring_compare`.
- The vulnerability affects all released versions of CHICKEN prior to 4.10.0.
- Patches and discussions related to the fix were available in the chicken-hackers mailing list.
- The fix for the vulnerability was included in CHICKEN 4.10.0
