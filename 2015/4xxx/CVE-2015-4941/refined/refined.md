- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of abbreviated TLS handshakes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The MQXR service in IBM MQ Light does not correctly handle abbreviated TLS handshakes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause the MQXR service to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must be able to initiate a connection and send a crafted abbreviated TLS handshake. No authentication is required.
