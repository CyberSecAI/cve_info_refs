Use CVE-2015-4645.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

unsquashfs-4: Add more sanity checks + fix [CVE-2015-4645](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j67g-6r6x-5v63 "CVE-2015-4645")/6

```
Add more filesystem table sanity checks to Unsquashfs-4 and
also properly fix [CVE-2015-4645](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j67g-6r6x-5v63 "CVE-2015-4645") and [CVE-2015-4646](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m77j-hm9g-ppq8 "CVE-2015-4646").

The CVEs were raised due to Unsquashfs having variable
oveflow and stack overflow in a number of vulnerable
functions.

The suggested patch only "fixed" one such function and fixed
it badly, and so it was buggy and introduced extra bugs!

The suggested patch was not only buggy, but, it used the
essentially wrong approach too.  It was "fixing" the
symptom but not the cause.  The symptom is wrong values
causing overflow, the cause is filesystem corruption.
This corruption should be detected and the filesystem
rejected *before* trying to allocate memory.

This patch applies the following fixes:

1. The filesystem super-block tables are checked, and the values
   must match across the filesystem.

   This will trap corrupted filesystems created by Mksquashfs.

2. The maximum (theorectical) size the filesystem tables could grow
   to, were analysed, and some variables were increased from int to
   long long.

   This analysis has been added as comments.

3. Stack allocation was removed, and a shared buffer (which is
   checked and increased as necessary) is used to read the
   table indexes.

# SQUASHFS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-73**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SQUASHFS, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-fs/squashfs-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3-r1** |

### Background

Squashfs is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. Squashfs is
intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in
cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block
device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
needed.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SQUASHFS. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote attackers, by enticing a user to process a specially crafted
SQUASHFS image, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SQUASHFS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/squashfs-tools-4.3-r1"

```

## Description

Integer overflow in the read\_fragment\_table\_4 function in unsquash-4.c in Squashfs and sasquatch allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted input, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
