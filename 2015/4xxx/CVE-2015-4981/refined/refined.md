Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-4981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated, but it is related to the IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows a local, non-privileged attacker to read system memory contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in system memory.
- The impact is limited to confidentiality (reading memory contents), with no indication of impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- It doesn't require any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be local to the system.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.0 thru V4.1.1.1
- IBM GPFS V4.1.0.0 thru V4.1.0.8
- IBM GPFS V3.5.0.0 thru V3.5.0.26
- DB2 LUW is also affected when the DB2 pureScale Feature is used with GPFS V3.5 on AIX and Linux. Specifically:
    -  IBM DB2 V9.8 with impacted fixpack levels on AIX or Linux.
    -  IBM DB2 V10.1 and V10.5 on AIX and Linux are impacted.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.2 or IBM GPFS V3.5.0.27 as appropriate for your level of code.
- For DB2, apply V10.1 FP6 and V10.5 FP8 or a special build if using V9.8.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS Base Score: 4.0
- CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
