Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect byte-alignment handling during LZX decompression in `lzxd_decompress()`.
- Specifically, the code assumed that it could always rewind the input pointer (`i_ptr`) by 2 bytes when aligning to byte boundaries after processing a bitstream. However, due to a previous change in 2006, the input buffer might only have 1 byte available, leading to an under-read when attempting to move the pointer back by 2 bytes.
- This incorrect assumption was caused by a change to allow `READ_BYTES` to read bytes straddling two blocks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Off-by-one buffer under-read:** The code attempts to read a byte from memory before the beginning of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The under-read leads to an attempt to access memory outside of the allocated buffer, resulting in a crash.
- The AddressSanitizer error message "heap-buffer-overflow on address 0xf4a028ff" confirms a memory safety issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when decompressing a specially crafted CAB file.
- The provided `lzxd-under-read.cab` file demonstrates a test case.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious CAB file for processing by the affected `libmspack` library.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `mspack/lzxd.c`, specifically around line 516.
- The relevant code snippet is:
```c
         /* read 1-16 (not 0-15) bits to align to bytes */
         ENSURE_BITS(16);
         if (bits_left > 16) i_ptr -= 2;
         bits_left = 0; bit_buffer = 0;

         /* read 12 bytes of stored R0 / R1 / R2 values */
         for (rundest = &buf[0], i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
           READ_IF_NEEDED;
           *rundest++ = *i_ptr++;
         }
```
- The `if (bits_left > 16) i_ptr -= 2;` line is the source of the problem. When `bits_left` is not greater than 16 and a bit-aligned read results in only one byte being available, this under-read will occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was reported by Jakub Wilk.
- A fix was committed by Stuart Caie.
- The vulnerability was fixed in libmspack version 0.5-1.
- The Debian bug report #775499 tracks this issue and confirms CVE-2015-4471 as the identifier for this vulnerability.
