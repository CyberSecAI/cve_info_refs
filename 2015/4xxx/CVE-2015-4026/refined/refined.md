Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-4026:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `pcntl_exec()` function in PHP does not properly validate the path argument, specifically failing to handle NULL characters.
*   This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243, which had addressed a similar issue but was later regressed in newer PHP versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `pcntl_exec()` function does not check for null bytes in the path argument.
*   **Path Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a null byte into the path argument, causing the function to truncate the path and execute a different program than intended.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By injecting a NULL character into the path, an attacker can potentially execute an unintended program by truncating the path to the intended program with the injected NULL character
*   **Bypass of intended file system access restrictions:** An attacker can manipulate the path to potentially bypass intended file system access restrictions.
*   **Denial of Service**: It was also noted that under certain conditions this could lead to a denial of service attack.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted path argument to the `pcntl_exec()` function in PHP.
*   A remote attacker can exploit this by controlling the first argument to the function, specifically through the injection of a null byte.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to control, or at least influence, the path argument passed to the `pcntl_exec()` function.
*   The attacker needs to be able to pass a string containing a NULL character into the function, and bypass any checks that may attempt to prevent this.

The provided content offers more details than the official CVE description, including:

*   A test script demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The specific line of code within `tar.c` where a related heap overflow can occur, which has been addressed by the same fix: `tar.c:437 : if (entry.filename[entry.filename_len - 1] == '/') { entry.filename[entry.filename_len - 1] = '\0'; entry.filename_len--; }`
*   A test case showing that the vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault.
*   Confirmation of the vulnerability's presence in multiple PHP versions: before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9.
*   The fix applied in PHP truncates the path string when a null byte is found.
*   It is noted that in case of pcntl\_exec(), function argument is a command to be executed, hence is unlikely to be from an untrusted source.
