    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a partial impact on the availability of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to the system where the vulnerable component is running.",

    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have local access to the system.",
      "The attacker needs the ability to provide malicious input to the vulnerable Outside In PDF Export SDK, possibly through a file or data stream processed by an application using the SDK."
