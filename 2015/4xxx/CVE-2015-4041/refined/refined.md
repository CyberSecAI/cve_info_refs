{
  "CVE-2015-4041": {
    "Root cause": "Memory handling error in coreutils' sort utility when performing case-insensitive sorting with UTF-8 encoding due to incorrect buffer allocation for character conversion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect buffer allocation leading to heap overflow."
    ],
    "Impact": "A heap overflow can be triggered leading to program crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": "By providing crafted input to the `sort` utility with `-f` (case-insensitive) option and UTF-8 locale, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `sort` command with specific arguments and control the input file content."
