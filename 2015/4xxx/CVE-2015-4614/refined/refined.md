Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of `sprintf()` to format SQL queries in the `Functions.php` file of the `easy2map` WordPress plugin. This method does not properly sanitize user-supplied inputs or parameterize the SQL queries, leaving the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure use of `sprintf()` in constructing SQL queries. User inputs are directly inserted into the query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries. Specifically, the following locations are vulnerable:
    - Updating `PolyLines`
    - Updating multiple fields like `TemplateID`, `MapName`, `Settings` etc.
    - Inserting new map data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation can lead to attackers manipulating the database. This includes reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, attackers might escalate privileges to gain control over the database server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers may extract confidential information, potentially leading to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP requests:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through HTTP requests, particularly via the `mapID`, `mapName` and other parameters involved in the plugin's map management functions. The `admin-ajax.php` file is one of the entry points for such attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target WordPress website.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality (WordPress admin panel).
- **Understanding of Plugin Parameters:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of the plugin's API, particularly how to interact with `admin-ajax.php` to trigger the vulnerable queries.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippets use `sprintf()` to create SQL queries. For example:
```php
$wpdb->query(sprintf("UPDATE $mapsTable SET PolyLines = '%s' WHERE ID = '%s';", $PolyLines, $mapID));
```
- This makes it easy for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through parameters like `$mapID`, `$PolyLines` etc
- The code was updated in version 1.2.5 to use `$wpdb->prepare()` which provides parameterized queries for protection against SQL injection.

**Exploit Code Example:**
```bash
$ sqlmap -u 'http://wp.site:80/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data="mapID=11&mapName='+or+1%3D%3D1%3B&action=e2m_img_save_map_name" --cookie='COOKIE HERE' --level=5 --risk=3
```
This `sqlmap` command demonstrates how an attacker can use SQL injection through the `mapName` parameter.

In summary, CVE-2015-4614 describes a classic SQL injection vulnerability in the `easy2map` WordPress plugin due to the insecure use of `sprintf()` for database queries. Successful exploitation can lead to serious consequences, such as data breaches and database manipulation.
