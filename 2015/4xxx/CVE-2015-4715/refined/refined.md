The provided content is a commit diff from the owncloud/core repository on GitHub. The commit reverts a custom patch that was causing problems. The specific change is in the `apps/files_external/3rdparty/Dropbox/OAuth/Curl.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The reverted patch introduced a check for file upload attempts by looking for strings starting with "@" symbol. If found, it would call exit(). This was likely an attempt to prevent a specific vulnerability, but instead introduced a denial of service condition by halting the request if an argument started with "@" during a POST request to the Dropbox API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The patch introduced a check in a loop processing POST parameters. If any parameter value begins with the "@" symbol, the script calls `exit()`, immediately terminating the PHP script and preventing further execution. This can be exploited by an attacker to trigger a DoS by sending a specially crafted POST request with one or more parameters beginning with `@`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the application by crafting specific requests that cause the script to terminate, preventing legitimate users from completing their tasks, specifically related to dropbox functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by POST requests to the Dropbox API that contain POST parameters with a value starting with `@`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application, targeting the affected functionality related to Dropbox integration. This implies a client side attacker who is making calls to the owncloud instance and dropbox api.

The commit comment "Revert custom patch that can cause problems" clearly states the purpose of the change and the associated problem. The code diff shows a loop that checks each argument and terminates the script if it begins with '@'. This specific check is removed by the reverted commit, fixing the DoS.
