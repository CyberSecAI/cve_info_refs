Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the `vhost_scsi_make_tpg()` function within the Linux kernel's vhost/scsi driver. The code used an incorrect data type for `tpgt`, where it was being limited to `UINT_MAX` (maximum value of an unsigned int), while the actual field `tpg->tport_tpgt` was a `u16` (16-bit unsigned integer). This discrepancy allowed a larger than intended value for `tpgt` to slip past the initial check, potentially causing an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect Data Type**: Using `unsigned long` for `tpgt` while the target field `tpg->tport_tpgt` is a `u16`, and then using the value as an array index.
- **Out-of-Bounds Write**: The `tpg->tport_tpgt` field is used as an index into the `vs_tpg[]` array, which has a maximum of `VHOST_SCSI_MAX_TARGET` (256) elements. If `tpgt` is greater than 255, then an out-of-bounds write occurs, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Writing to memory locations outside the bounds of the `vs_tpg[]` array.
- **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can lead to a system crash.
- **Possible Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption could potentially be exploited to gain control or escalate privileges

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted `VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT` ioctl call: The attacker needs to craft a specific ioctl call with an incorrect value for the tpgt parameter that leads to an out of bounds write.
- Local Access: The vulnerability can be triggered by a user with access to `/dev/kvm`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user with access to /dev/kvm
- Ability to call the `VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT` ioctl.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the vhost/scsi driver.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions are not affected as `CONFIG_VHOST_SCSI` is not enabled in Red Hat products.
- The fix involves limiting `tpgt` to `VHOST_SCSI_MAX_TARGET` and removing the mask in `vhost_scsi_send_evt()`.
- The patch is available in the Linux kernel source tree with commit ID: `59c816c1f24df0204e01851431d3bab3eb76719c`
