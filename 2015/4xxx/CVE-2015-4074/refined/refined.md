Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-4074:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Joomla! Helpdesk Pro plugin fails to properly sanitize the `filename` parameter in the `ticket.download_attachment` task, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal/Local File Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `filename` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, password files, and other confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted GET request to the `component/helpdeskpro` with `task=ticket.download_attachment` and a manipulated `filename` parameter containing path traversal sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable path is:
    `https://{url}/?option=com_helpdeskpro&task=ticket.download_attachment&filename=/../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&original_filename=AnyFileName.exe`

*   The attacker can modify the `filename` parameter to access any file on the server that the webserver has read permissions for.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered by Outpost24 researchers.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.4.0 of the Joomla! Helpdesk Pro plugin.
