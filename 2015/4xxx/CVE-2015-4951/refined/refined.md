- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a specially crafted URL sent to the Tivoli Storage Manager Web client, which can lead to a crash of the Client Acceptor Daemon (CAD).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility of the CAD to crash when receiving a malicious URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the CAD.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where a specially crafted URL is sent to the vulnerable TSM Web client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system's TSM Web client. The vulnerability is exploitable only when the CAD service is running and is managing the web client (i.e., MANAGEDSERVICES option either contains WEBCLIENT or is not explicitly set).
