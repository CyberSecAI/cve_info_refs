- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'sort' parameter used in author search within the Symphony CMS admin interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The system attempts to escape strings by prepending a backslash (e.g., 'HELL' becomes '\'HELL\''), but this escaping mechanism can be bypassed by encoding the string using JavaScript functions like `charCodeAt()` and `fromCharCode()`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to the `/symphony/system/authors/` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `sort` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Symphony CMS instance and knowledge of the bypass technique using JavaScript functions. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
