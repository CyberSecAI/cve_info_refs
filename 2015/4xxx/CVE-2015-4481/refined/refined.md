CVE-2015-4481
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists in the Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows. This service, which runs with elevated privileges (SYSTEM), can be tricked into writing its log file to an arbitrary file location. This is achieved by creating a hard link to a target file and then exploiting a race condition during the service's startup process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The service's log file creation process is vulnerable to a race condition. An attacker can create a hard link to a target file before the service creates its log file, thus redirecting writes to the linked file.
- **Insecure Log File Location:** The default log file directory is user-writable, which allows low-privileged users to create hard links.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Because of the race condition and hard links, a low privileged user can cause the maintenance service to overwrite a file, even if the user would not normally have the right to modify the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting a file used by an elevated process (e.g., a script), an attacker may be able to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting crucial files may cause a denial-of-service condition, either by crashing the system or rendering an application unusable.
- **File corruption**: The overwritten file can be corrupted by the log data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local filesystem access to create a hard link and trigger the race condition.
- **Local Program Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute local programs to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on a Windows system where the vulnerable maintenance service is installed.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code locally.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects Windows systems.
- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the location of the log file to a secure location, deleting the destination file, and moving a temp file into its place.
- The Suse content mentions this has low severity but the upstream information (Mozilla) rates this has a high severity flaw.
- Mozilla's advisory also mentions that a similar vulnerability exists in the way the service writes its update status, and has been fixed.
- The vulnerability is identified by CVE-2015-4481.
- The fix was included in Firefox 40 and Firefox ESR 38.2
