  "CVE-2015-4806": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HttpURLConnection class in OpenJDK allows setting custom values for blacklisted headers by supplying \"Name:value\" as the header name, bypassing intended restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypassing header restrictions in HttpURLConnection.",
      "Incorrect handling of header names leading to setting of restricted headers.",
        "Improper parsing of header names"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass restrictions by setting arbitrary request headers, potentially leading to information disclosure and data modification.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs through crafted HTTP requests using a vulnerable version of HttpURLConnection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable system, no authentication is required."
