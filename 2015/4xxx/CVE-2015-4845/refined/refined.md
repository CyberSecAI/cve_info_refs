Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A script (`Aoljtest.js`) within Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) is used to test database connections and displays the connection status. Different connection results could be used to infer the existence of valid database user accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **User Enumeration:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to enumerate valid database users by observing the responses to connection attempts. This can occur due to the different status messages returned by the vulnerable script.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) :**  The advisory also mentions SSRF as an impact of this vulnerability, although it's not explicitly explained in detail. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to identify valid database user accounts. This is crucial for further attacks like password guessing, brute-forcing, or leveraging existing privileges.
- **SSRF:** The potential for SSRF may allow an attacker to interact with internal resources or services, opening the door for more critical attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Vulnerable Script:** Exploitation involves sending crafted requests to the vulnerable `Aoljtest.js` script within EBS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the EBS system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is identified as `ERPSCAN-15-025`.
- The vulnerable version of Oracle EBS is 12.2.4 but other versions may be affected.
- A patch was made available in the Oracle CPU of October 2015.
