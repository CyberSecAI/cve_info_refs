Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of OCSP nextUpdate checking within the Libraries component of OpenJDK. Specifically, an OCSP response lacking the `nextUpdate` date was incorrectly treated as having unlimited validity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of OCSP responses
- Failure to handle missing `nextUpdate` dates correctly
- Resultant acceptance of revoked X.509 certificates as valid

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a malicious actor to bypass the intended revocation mechanism for X.509 certificates. This enables the use of revoked certificates, which could lead to:
- Data breaches through compromised authentication
- Man-in-the-middle attacks using compromised certificates
- Unauthorized access and actions based on compromised identities

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks via OCSP
- Exploitation through untrusted Java applications or applets that perform certificate validation via OCSP

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to generate a valid X.509 certificate and then have it revoked
- Ability to present a forged OCSP response with no nextUpdate field, or have a legitimate response that doesn't include it
- Ability to have a victim use a vulnerable version of OpenJDK when validating the certificate

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability is present in Oracle Java SE 6u95, 7u80, and 8u45; JRockit R28.3.6; and Java SE Embedded 7u75 and Embedded 8u33.
* The provided CVSSv2 vector and score indicates a High complexity attack that could result in complete confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.
* Various vendors (SUSE, RedHat, Ubuntu) released patches that address this vulnerability.
* This vulnerability is often listed alongside other OpenJDK vulnerabilities from the same patch cycle due to the fact that they were all fixed in the same updates.
