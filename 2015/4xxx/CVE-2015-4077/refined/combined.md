##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [CORE-2015-0013] - FortiClient Antivirus Multiple Vulnerabilities

---

*From*: CORE Advisories Team <advisories () coresecurity com>

*Date*: Tue, 1 Sep 2015 13:56:33 -0300

---

```
1. Advisory Information

Title: FortiClient Antivirus Multiple Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0013
Advisory URL: <http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/forticlient-antivirus-multiple-vulnerabilities>
Date published: 2015-09-01
Date of last update: 2015-09-01
Vendors contacted: Fortinet
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

Class: Information Exposure [CWE-200], Write-what-where Condition [CWE-123], Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
[CWE-749], Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control [CWE-782]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2015-4077, CVE-2015-5735, CVE-2015-5736, CVE-2015-5737

3. Vulnerability Description

Fortinet FortiClient [1] extends the power of FortiGate's Unified threat management to endpoints on your network.
Desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones, FortiClient enables every device - local or remote, stationary or mobile -
to integrate with your FortiGate. With no per-seat license fees, FortiClient takes the headaches out of managing
multiple endpoints so your users and guests can work efficiently anywhere, without compromising your security.

FortiClient drivers are prone to multiple attacks and expose a wide surface that allows users to easily get SYSTEM
privileges.

4. Vulnerable packages

FortiClient 5.2.3.633
Other versions may probably be affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Fortinet released an updated version of FortiClient 5.2.4.0650 [2] that fixes the reported issues.

6. Credits

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Enrique Nissim from Core Security's Consulting Team. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Security's Advisories Team.

7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

[CVE-2015-4077] The vulnerability lies in the drivers "mdare64_48.sys", "mdare32_48.sys", "mdare32_52.sys" and
"mdare64_52.sys". By using the IOCTL 0x22608C with the proper parameters, an attacker is able to read arbitrary memory
content from kernelspace.

[CVE-2015-5735] The vulnerability lies in the drivers "mdare64_48.sys", "mdare32_48.sys", "mdare32_52.sys" and
"mdare64_52.sys". By using the IOCTL 0x226108, the attacker is able to call ZwEnumerateValueKey and write its output to
an arbitrary memory location.

[CVE-2015-5736] The vulnerability lies in "Fortishield.sys", which is a minifilter filesystem driver that hooks
filesystem operations. IOCTL 0x220024 and 0x220028 both allow establishing callbacks that will be called during any
IRP_MJ_WRITE and IRP_MJ_SET_INFORMATION, respectively. Consequently, any user in the system can set an arbitrary
function as a callback and execute code with kernel privileges.

[CVE-2015-5737] The vulnerability lies in the drivers "mdare64_48.sys", "mdare32_48.sys", "mdare32_52.sys",
"mdare64_52.sys" and "Fortishield.sys". All of these drivers expose an API to manage processes and the Windows
registry. For instance, the IOCTL 0x2220c8 of the "mdareXX_XX.sys" driver returns a full privileged handle to a given
process PID. This same function is replicated inside "Fortishield.sys".

8. Report Timeline

2015-06-25: Core Security notified Fortinet of the vulnerabilities. Publication date set for July 27th, 2015.
2015-06-30: Fortinet replied that they received Core Security's email and that they would like to receive the draft
version of the advisory.
2015-07-01: Core Security sent Fortinet the draft version of the advisory and requested a tentative schedule for
releasing the updates.
2015-07-01: Fortinet replied that they received the draft version of the advisory and that they would review it.
2015-07-15: Core Security requested an update from Fortinet regarding the reported vulnerabilities and a tentative
schedule.
2015-07-19: Fortinet replied and confirmed the reported bugs, but stated that they were only able to trigger them with
administrative privileges. They requested a PoC from Core Security.
2015-07-20: Core Security replied, explaining to Fortinet that they were able to trigger the vulnerabilities as a
non-privileged user. They sent Fortinet a PoC code that opens a handle with read/write permissions to LSASS process and
then uses it to allocate memory in its virtual address space.
2015-07-20: Fortinet replied that they would review the PoC.
2015-07-20: Fortinet asked if Core Security researchers could review an interim build when available.
2015-07-21: Core Security confirmed that they would be willing to review an interim build when available.
2015-08-03: Core Security requested an update from Fortinet regarding the availability of the interim build, and asked
if there was a specific date Fortinet was planning to release the fix.
2015-08-04: Fortinet replied that their current release date was August 17.
2015-08-05: Fortinet updated the schedule, explaining that the interim build wouldn't include the MDARE fixes therefore
delaying the release until the end of August.
2015-08-07: Core Security asked Fortinet if the interim build was going to be published by Fortinet, because if so,
that would force Core Security to publish their findings as well. If that wasn't the case, Core Security recommended
publishing everything together later that month.
2015-08-07: Fortinet replied that the interim build was private and therefore there wasn't a need to publish ahead of
schedule.
2015-08-10: Fortinet sent Core Security a link to download the interim build and requested feedback.
2015-08-10: Core Security replied that they received and downloaded the interim build and would send feedback.
Additionally, Core Security requested an updated ETA.
2015-08-18: Core Security requested the specific date Fortinet would release the patched version of their product so
they could schedule their security advisory publication accordingly.
2015-08-20: Core Security again requested for a specific date for the publication of the updates and informed Fortinet
them that if they didn't receive and answer in the following days they would be forced to schedule the advisory
publication.
2015-08-20: Fortinet replied that the scheduled release date for the updated version of FortiClient was August 31. They
asked if they had an opportunity to review the interim build andif they had any feedback.
2015-08-24: Core Security replied that they were able to review the interim build and that they could confirm that
those bugs were no longer exploitable.Core Security requested and updated ETA of the updated version.
2015-08-24: Fortinet replied that the scheduled release seemed to be confirmed and that the estimated time of
availability would be roughly 5 p.m. Pacific Time.
