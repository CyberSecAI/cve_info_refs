{
  "CVE-2015-4077": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies in the drivers \"mdare64_48.sys\", \"mdare32_48.sys\", \"mdare32_52.sys\" and \"mdare64_52.sys\". By using the IOCTL 0x22608C with the proper parameters, an attacker is able to read arbitrary memory content from kernelspace.",
    "Root cause": "Improper access control on IOCTL 0x22608C.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
      "Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary kernel memory read, potentially leading to information disclosure, and enabling further exploitation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specific IO control code (0x22608C) to the vulnerable driver.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system."
  }
