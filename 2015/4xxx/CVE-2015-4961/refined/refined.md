Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Internal connections between IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience servers use unencrypted HTTP. This means that data transmitted between the Tealeaf Data Service, Search Service, Replay Service, and Tracking Service is not protected by encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cleartext Communication:** The primary weakness is the use of unencrypted HTTP for internal server communications. This exposes sensitive information to eavesdropping.
*   **Lack of Confidentiality:** Data transmitted in cleartext can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information from the local network by intercepting the unencrypted communications via man-in-the-middle attacks. The specific information that can be exposed is not detailed but could include session data, customer data, or internal configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the Tealeaf servers to intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic. This could involve compromising a host on the network or exploiting a vulnerability in the network infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the local network where the vulnerable Tealeaf servers are located.
*   **Network Sniffing Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic on the local network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in a range of versions, from IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience v8.0 to v9.0.2 and IBM Tealeaf Customer Experience on Cloud Network Capture Add-On: v16.1.01.
*   The provided content gives detailed remediation/fix information with links to specific fix packs for various versions.
*   Workarounds suggest limiting access to local networks to mitigate the risk.
*   The CVSS vector is AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating the attack vector is adjacent, high attack complexity, no privileges needed, no user interaction required, unchanged scope, low confidentiality impact, no integrity impact and no availability impact.
