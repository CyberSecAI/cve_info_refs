Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-4615

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and parameterization in the `easy2map-photos` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin directly incorporates user-supplied data from `$_REQUEST` into SQL queries without sanitizing or using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure construction of SQL queries. The plugin takes user input from the `$_REQUEST` array and directly inserts them into SQL queries without sanitization.  Vulnerable code segments are found in the `functions.php` file, specifically lines 48, 218, 239 and 331, and affects the `PolyLines`, `TemplateID`, `MapName`, `Settings`, `CSSValues`, `CSSValuesPhoto`, `CSSValuesMap`, and `MapHTML` fields.

*  **Path Traversal:** There's a path traversal vulnerability in `MapPinImageUpload.php` and `MapPinIconSave.php`. The code does not validate user input for the file upload path, allowing an attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations outside of the designated directory by using `../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the entire WordPress website.
*   **Path Traversal:** Successful exploitation of path traversal can allow the attacker to:
     *  Overwrite existing files.
     *  Upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
     *  Potentially compromise the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, including malicious SQL code within the `mapID`, and `mapName` parameters, or within the  `mapTemplateName`, `mapName`, `mapSettingsXML`, `parentCSSXML`, `photoCSSXML`, `mapCSSXML`, `mapHTML` parameters.
*   **Path Traversal:** The path traversal vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with a malicious file path that includes `../` sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   For the SQL injection, the attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameters, but does not require authentication if the function calls are performed on `admin-ajax.php`.
*   For path traversal, the attacker needs the ability to upload files or manipulate file paths in the upload process.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory mentions both CVE-2015-4615 (SQL Injection) and CVE-2015-4617 (Path Traversal), although only CVE-2015-4615 was requested for analysis.
* The provided exploit code gives an example of using `sqlmap` to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
* The plugin was closed as of April 21, 2016, and is not available for download.
