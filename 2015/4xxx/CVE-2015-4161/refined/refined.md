The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-2282 which is a stack-based buffer overflow and CVE-2015-2278, which involves an out-of-bounds read in the LZC/LZH compression algorithms used in various SAP products. Since the CVE description retrieval is a placeholder, this response will focus on the two relevant vulnerabilities from the provided content that are not related to CVE-2015-4161.

**CVE-2015-2282 (Stack-based Overflow in LZC Compression)**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `CsDecomprLZC` function of the LZC compression algorithm. The `code` variable, controlled by the attacker, is used to index into the prefix table (`TAB_PREFIXOF`). If `code` and the values within the prefix table are both greater than 256, a stack overflow occurs when the code attempts to write values to the stack via `*stackp++ = TAB_SUFFIXOF(code)`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to complete control of the application, denial of service, or command execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted compressed data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted data to a vulnerable SAP component or client that utilizes the affected compression algorithm.

**CVE-2015-2278 (Out-of-Bounds Read in LZH Compression)**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `BuildHufTree` function of the LZH compression algorithm. The attacker controls the values of `p` and `s`, and the code uses `*p-s` as an index into arrays 'e' and 'd', leading to an out-of-bounds read if the calculated index is outside the bounds of the arrays.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can read data stored outside of the intended buffer.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers can exploit this by sending specially crafted compressed data to vulnerable applications.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to provide specially crafted compressed data.
