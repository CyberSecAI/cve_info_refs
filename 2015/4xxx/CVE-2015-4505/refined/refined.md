    "description": "updater.exe in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 on Windows allows local users to write to arbitrary files by conducting a junction attack and waiting for an update operation by the Mozilla Maintenance Service.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the process of executing a staged update. During this process the updated files are written to a user-controlled working directory. Also temporary update files like *.patch files are written to this directory. As in Bug #925747 these files can be manipulated to change how files are updated, if the attacker sets the working directory path to a writable location. Manipulations are limited to files in the working directory but with a junction it is possible to break out of the working directory and change arbitrary files. Different to hard links a standard windows user has the rights to create junctions (win7).",
