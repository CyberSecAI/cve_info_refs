**Summary:** The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities affecting Polycom RealPresence Resource Manager (RPRM) versions prior to 8.4. Among these, CVE-2015-4684 is specifically associated with path traversal vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary file disclosure and upload.

**Vulnerability 1 (CVE-2015-4684): Arbitrary file disclosure (I) via path traversal**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the file download functionality.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability allows downloading arbitrary files from the server.
*  **Impact:** An authenticated unprivileged attacker can download sensitive files from the server due to the vulnerability being executed with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating the `Modifier` parameter in the  `FileDownload` request.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.

**Vulnerability 2 (CVE-2015-4684): Arbitrary file upload via path traversal**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation when importing user aliases in the web interface.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability allows uploading files to arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** An attacker, after gaining admin privileges (potentially through other vulnerabilities), can upload a webshell and execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the "plcm" user.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `Filename` and `SE_FNAME` parameters in a `FileUpload` request.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Requires admin privileges in the web interface which can be gained by combining other vulnerabilities in the advisory.

**Vulnerability 3 (CVE-2015-4684): Arbitrary file disclosure (II) and removal (path traversal)**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the file import functionality through SOAP requests.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability allows downloading and removing arbitrary files from the server.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated admin user can download or delete arbitrary files due to the vulnerability being executed with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `filePathName` parameter in a `importSipUriReservations` SOAP request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Requires admin privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities, including plaintext password disclosure, plaintext passwords stored in log files, sudo misconfigurations, weak/missing authorization, absolute path disclosure, and session ID exposure in GET parameters.
*   Combining multiple vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise, including root access and access to all conference passcodes, allowing an attacker to join or record any conference.
*   The vendor was notified, and version 8.4 addresses most of the vulnerabilities, except for the weak/missing authorization issue.
