Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Pimcore CMS application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `AssetController.php` file is vulnerable when processing grid proxy requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. An attacker could potentially gain control over the database or even the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `gridProxyAction` function in `AssetController.php`.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code constructs a SQL `WHERE` clause using unsanitized user-provided values (filter values from a grid)
- The vulnerable code is in `pimcore/modules/admin/controllers/AssetController.php` in the `gridProxyAction` function, and was fixed by quoting the value parameter in the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs an administrative account with the 'assets' privilege. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible to authenticated users within a specific administrative context.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Pimcore CMS Build 3450 and was fixed in Build 3473.
- The advisory was originally released by Portcullis Advisories.

The provided github commit shows the exact code change that fixed this vulnerability by properly quoting the user-provided value in the SQL query:
