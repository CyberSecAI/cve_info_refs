- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Smoelenboek` extension fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** User-supplied input is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to supply input to the vulnerable extension. The CVSS score suggests an authenticated attacker.
