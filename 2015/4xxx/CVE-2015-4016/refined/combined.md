## Steam Client Update Released

Client Update - Valve

13 May, 2015

(NOTE: This update was re-released on May 15 to include a new security fix.)

An update has been released for the Steam Client and will be automatically downloaded.

**General**

* Updated the web control to CEF version 41.0.2272.104
  * Improved CPU and memory usage in the web control
    * Changed the "Verify Integrity" progress box to permit access to the rest of the Steam client
      * Fixed cases where the server browser did not respect the current pings-per-minute limit
        * Fixed bugs which caused CD key receipts to print incorrectly
          * Fixed failure to back up all game content in certain cases (eg. for FSX)
            * Fixed a denial-of-service exploit that could be used to crash Steam remotely. (Thanks to Elvis Collado of HP DVLabs working with HP's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this exploit.)

**Big Picture**

* Added the ability to filter your friends list
  * Added a disk management page to settings that lets you view and delete installed games
    * Stopped displaying daisy wheel for checkboxes and other non-text inputs on web forms

**In-Home Streaming**

* Fixed a crash when exiting the streaming client

**Windows**

* Fixed compatibility issues preventing Steam from starting on older Athlon XP CPUs
  * Fixed a bug which could result in two screenshots for a single key press in games which process input via both DirectInput and Win32 messages

**Linux**

* Fixed double-triggering of the Enter key when typing in text fields on web pages
