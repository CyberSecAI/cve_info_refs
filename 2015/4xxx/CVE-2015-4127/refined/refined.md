Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4127:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `church_admin` WordPress plugin's registration form, specifically within the handling of the address field. The plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it back to the user on the directory page.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core weakness is a lack of input sanitization, leading to a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the address field on the registration form is vulnerable.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the address field during user registration. When a user visits the directory page, this malicious script will be executed in their browser.  This could result in:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's browser context.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the registration form of the `church_admin` plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a registration form to the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. This is generally an unauthenticated action; anyone can fill out the form unless further access restrictions are put in place.

**Technical Details**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** WordPress Church Admin Plugin
*   **Vulnerable Version:** 0.800
*   **Exploit Type:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Proof of Concept (from Exploit-DB):**
    1.  An attacker submits a registration form with a malicious JavaScript payload in the address field. The provided payload is `<script>confirm()</script>`.
    2.  When a user navigates to the directory page (where user addresses are displayed) the javascript is executed in their browser.

**Mitigation**
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.810 of the plugin.

**Additional Notes**

*   The exploit is confirmed as a "Stored XSS" because the malicious script is stored in the database and executed whenever the affected page is loaded.
*   The provided exploit code targets the address field specifically.
* The exploit-db entry notes OSVDB ID : http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/121304 and WPVULNDB ID : https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/7999.
