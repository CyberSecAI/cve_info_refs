## Installation

1. Upload the `church_admin` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Place [church\_admin type=address-list member\_type\_id=# map=1 photo=1] on the page you want the address book displayed, member\_type=1 for members, map=1 toshow map for geocoded addresses. The member\_type\_id can be comma separated e.g. member\_type\_id=1,2,3
4. Place [church\_admin type=small-groups-list] on the page you want the small group list displayed
5. Place [church\_admin type=small-groups ] on the page you want the list of small groups and their members displayed
6. Place [church\_admin type=rota] on the page you want the rota displayed
7. Place [church\_admin type=calendar category=# weeks=#] on the page you want a page per month calendar displayed
8. Place [church\_admin type=calendar-list] on the page you want a agenda view calendar – option category and weeks options pastable from category admin page
9. There is a calendar widget with customisable title, how many events you want to show and an option for it to look like a post-it note
10. Place [church\_admin\_map member\_type\_id=#] to show a map of colour coded small groups – need to set a service venue first to centre map and geolocate member’s addresses by editing them.

    We recommend password protecting the pages – if it is password protected, a link is provided to logout

    The # should be replaced with which member types you want displayed as a comma separated list e.g. member\_type=1,2

I am just starting to tap this plugin’s capabilities for our church. The more I learn about it, the more impressed I become. It quickly became obvious that Andy isn’t just a software developer, but also someone who truly understands the needs of a church organization with regard to creating a web presence.
But what impresses me most is Andy’s responsiveness in supporting his plugin users. For example last night before I went to bed, I sent an email to Andy noting a formatting issue with the member registration form, and by the time I got home from work this evening, Andy had put out a new update that resolves the problem. That’s only one of several issues he’s quickly helped me out with. Those other issues were my own user problems not issues with the plugin code.
Andy and this plugin are responsive to the nth degree. Love it.

WP-Church Admin This is a great ministry providing tools to help administer small to medium size church at no cost (aside from a one-time fee if you would like to also include the Mobile App)
The author continues to improve and enhance the features and functionality and is open to suggestions to improve it even further.
I can’t recommend the plugin highly enough and am thankful to Our Lord for providing such a dedicated working in Andy Moyle (the author) for the blessing this is to the church.

I am afraid I cannot see where all the good reviews are coming from. Simply activating this plugin reduces your page speed by at least 60%. The use of tables and frames makes styling difficult.

This plugin is simply amazing and is constantly getting updates/improvements. Having tried pretty much every other option out there, I can tell you that the plugin has everything you might need – without the crazy prices or security concerns that seem to come with other developer offerings. Until I found “Church Admin”, the other plugins I tried either had some shady code embedded or they were unbelievably out of our price range. This one is highly customizable with fantastic development support. Sign up for the Andriod/IOS app to support the developer! You will not be disappointed.

We were looking for something more than just using a sermon browser plugin to post our latest talks at church. Andy Moyle has created a fantastic all in one product that serves the majority of backend church administration. From displaying your latest sermons to having a fully fledged member directory this is my favourite of all plugins I’ve ever used. Great support from Andy and regular updates.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
