Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in wpa_supplicant and
hostapd. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2015-4141

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered a
    vulnerability in the WPS UPnP function with HTTP chunked transfer
    encoding which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4142

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered a
    vulnerability in the WMM Action frame processing which may result in
    a denial of service.

CVE-2015-4143 CVE-2015-4144 CVE-2015-4145 CVE-2015-4146

    Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team discovered that
    EAP-pwd payload is not properly validated which may result in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2015-5310

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the WMM Sleep Mode Response frame
    processing. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    mount a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5314 CVE-2015-5315

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the handling of EAP-pwd messages
    which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-5316

    Jouni Malinen discovered a flaw in the handling of EAP-pwd Confirm
    messages which may result in a denial of service.

CVE-2015-8041

    Incomplete WPS and P2P NFC NDEF record payload length validation may
    result in a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0-3+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by CVE-2015-4141, CVE-2015-4142, CVE-2015-4143 and
CVE-2015-8041.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

EAP-pwd missing payload length validation
Published: May 4, 2015
Identifier: CVE-2015-4143, CVE-2015-4144, CVE-2015-4145, CVE-2015-4146
Latest version available from: http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/
Vulnerability
A vulnerability was found in EAP-pwd server and peer implementation used
in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant, respectively. The EAP-pwd/Commit and
EAP-pwd/Confirm message payload is processed without verifying that the
received frame is long enough to include all the fields. This results in
buffer read overflow of up to couple of hundred bytes.
The exact result of this buffer overflow depends on the platform and may
be either not noticeable (i.e., authentication fails due to invalid data
without any additional side effects) or process termination due to the
buffer read overflow being detected and stopped. The latter case could
potentially result in denial of service when EAP-pwd authentication is
used.
Further research into this issue found that the fragment reassembly
processing is also missing a check for the Total-Length field and this
could result in the payload length becoming negative. This itself would
not add more to the vulnerability due to the payload length not being
verified anyway. However, it is possible that a related reassembly step
would result in hitting an internal security check on buffer use and
result in the processing being terminated.

| Affected versions | < **2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5** |

| Package | **net-wireless/wpa\_supplicant** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5-r1** |

### Background

wpa\_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant with support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE
802.11i / RSN). hostapd is a user space daemon for access point and
authentication servers.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in both hostapd and wpa\_supplicant.
Please review the CVE identifiers for more information.

### Impact

Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process or cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All hostapd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/hostapd-2.5"

```

All wpa\_supplicant users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=net-wireless/wpa_supplicant-2.5-r1"

```

In support of this CVE assignment request for hostapd/wpa_supplicant,
here's the full advisory text:

EAP-pwd missing payload length validation

Published: May 4, 2015
Latest version available from: <http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/>

Vulnerability

A vulnerability was found in EAP-pwd server and peer implementation used
in hostapd and wpa_supplicant, respectively. The EAP-pwd/Commit and
EAP-pwd/Confirm message payload is processed without verifying that the
received frame is long enough to include all the fields. This results in
buffer read overflow of up to couple of hundred bytes.

The exact result of this buffer overflow depends on the platform and may
be either not noticeable (i.e., authentication fails due to invalid data
without any additional side effects) or process termination due to the
buffer read overflow being detected and stopped. The latter case could
potentially result in denial of service when EAP-pwd authentication is
used.

Further research into this issue found that the fragment reassembly
processing is also missing a check for the Total-Length field and this
could result in the payload length becoming negative. This itself would
not add more to the vulnerability due to the payload length not being
verified anyway. However, it is possible that a related reassembly step
would result in hitting an internal security check on buffer use and
result in the processing being terminated.

Vulnerable versions/configurations

hostapd v1.0-v2.4 with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build configuration
(hostapd/.config) and EAP-pwd authentication server enabled in runtime
configuration.

wpa_supplicant v1.0-v2.4 with CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y in the build
configuration (wpa_supplicant/.config) and EAP-pwd enabled in a network
profile at runtime.

Acknowledgments

Thanks to Kostya Kortchinsky of Google Security Team for discovering and
reporting this issue.

Possible mitigation steps

- Merge the following commits and rebuild hostapd/wpa_supplicant:

  EAP-pwd peer: Fix payload length validation for Commit and Confirm
  EAP-pwd server: Fix payload length validation for Commit and Confirm
  EAP-pwd peer: Fix Total-Length parsing for fragment reassembly
  EAP-pwd server: Fix Total-Length parsing for fragment reassembly
  EAP-pwd peer: Fix asymmetric fragmentation behavior

  These patches are available from <http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/>

- Update to hostapd/wpa_supplicant v2.5 or newer, once available

- Remove CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y from build configuration

- Disable EAP-pwd in runtime configuration
