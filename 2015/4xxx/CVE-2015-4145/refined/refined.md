Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the EAP-pwd fragment reassembly process. Specifically, before allocating a new buffer for reassembling fragments, the code doesn't verify if a fragment is already being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** If an attacker sends a series of crafted EAP-pwd messages, a new buffer can be allocated for reassembly without properly cleaning up the previous buffer. This results in a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Repeated exploitation of the memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing the application (hostapd or wpa\_supplicant) to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker needs to send crafted EAP-pwd messages to a vulnerable hostapd or wpa\_supplicant instance. This means the attacker needs to be within network range of the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target.
*   **EAP-pwd Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand EAP-pwd enough to construct malicious messages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both the server (hostapd) and client (wpa\_supplicant) implementations of EAP-pwd.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Kostya Kortchinsky of Google Security Team.
*   Patches for the issue were released as part of a series of fixes.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that a new buffer for reassembly is not allocated if one is already in progress.
