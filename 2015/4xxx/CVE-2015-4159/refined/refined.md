The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in SAP products. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding the LZC/LZH vulnerabilities, which are referenced in the description for CVE-2015-2282 and CVE-2015-2278, and how they relate to this CVE (CVE-2015-4159):

**Relates to:** While the content describes multiple vulnerabilities, the LZC stack-based overflow vulnerability (CVE-2015-2282) and LZH out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2015-2278) are closely related to the general issue of vulnerable compression algorithms in SAP systems. CVE-2015-4159 is not directly mentioned but due to the date and affected applications, the LZC and LZH vulnerabilities could be related to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

**1. Stack-based overflow vulnerability in LZC (CVE-2015-2282):**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `CsDecomprLZC` function when processing compressed data. The variable "code" contains an attacker-controlled value. If this value is greater than 256, the loop `while (code >= 256)` causes the stack to be filled with arbitrary values derived from the attacker-controlled prefix and suffix tables, potentially overwriting other data on the stack.

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution: By overflowing the stack with carefully crafted data, an attacker can overwrite return addresses and other critical stack data, redirecting execution flow to attacker-supplied code.
    *   Denial of service: By crashing the application by overflowing the stack.

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send specially crafted, compressed data to a vulnerable SAP application which uses the vulnerable LZC algorithm. This data manipulates the "code" variable and the prefix/suffix tables to cause the stack overflow.

*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted data to a service that uses the vulnerable LZC compression algorithm. This could be done by forging requests, injecting malicious packets in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario, or sending a specially crafted file (e.g., .CAR or .SAR).

**2. Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in LZH (CVE-2015-2278):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `BuildHufTree` function in the LZH decompression algorithm incorrectly indexes into arrays 'e' and 'd'.  The indices are calculated using the attacker-controlled variables 'p' and 's' with the calculation `*p - s`. By manipulating these values, an attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, accessing memory outside of the intended buffers.

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure: By reading out of bounds, an attacker may be able to access sensitive data in memory.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts special compressed data that when processed by the LZH algorithm causes the vulnerable code to access memory locations outside of the intended buffers.

*   **Required Capabilities:**  Similar to the LZC vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted data to a service or application that uses the vulnerable LZH compression algorithm. This could be via network requests, malicious files (.CAR/.SAR), or through a MitM attack.

**Affected Components:**

The document lists various SAP components that use the vulnerable LZC/LZH compression algorithms:

*   SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP
*   SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java
*   SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK
*   SAP RFC SDK
*   SAP GUI
*   SAP MaxDB database
*   SAPCAR archive tool

The vulnerabilities affect the following protocols:

*   Diag
*   RFC
*   MaxDB

**Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Server-side:** Attackers can exploit vulnerable server components like SAP NetWeaver services by sending crafted requests containing compressed data.
*   **Client-side:** Attackers can create malicious .CAR/.SAR packages which, upon being unpacked by the client, will trigger the vulnerability and allow for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers can inject malicious packets into communications to trigger vulnerabilities on unencrypted connections.

**Remediation:**
The content mentions SAP Security Notes 2124806, 2121661, 2127995, and 2125316 as relevant patches.

**In summary:**

This content provides detailed technical information about two vulnerabilities related to the LZC and LZH compression algorithms that affect a broad range of SAP products. It is likely these are related to CVE-2015-4159, and potentially other CVEs from the same period. The vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service. The primary attack vector involves sending specially crafted compressed data to vulnerable SAP components, and can be executed via multiple attack vectors.
