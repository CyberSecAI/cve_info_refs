  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The `Moped::BSON::ObjectId.legal?` method used an incorrect regular expression `\\A\\h{24}\\Z` which allowed a new line character (`\\n`) at the end of the input string, when it should have used `\\A\\h{24}\\z` (lowercase 'z'). This caused the method to return `true` for invalid ObjectIds.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service: By sending an invalid ObjectId with a trailing newline, the `legal?` method would incorrectly return `true`, causing the Moped driver to believe the MongoDB server was down, resulting in repeated connection attempts.",
      "BSON Injection: By using the flawed regex (`/^[0-9a-f]{24}$/i`), an attacker could craft a malicious ObjectId with embedded BSON commands, leading to potential data manipulation or other malicious actions."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (worker resource consumption). Additionally, an attacker can bypass authentication tokens and send arbitrary data to the MongoDB socket.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited over a network by sending crafted strings to an application using the vulnerable library, which then attempts to validate the input as a BSON ObjectId.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted strings over a network to a service using the vulnerable library. No authentication or user interaction is required."
