  "CVE-2015-4749": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Extracted Results": {
      "Root cause": "The DnsClient class in the JNDI component in OpenJDK failed to properly remove information about an outgoing DNS request from the list of outstanding DNS requests when certain errors occurred during DNS resolution.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of DNS resolution errors",
        "Failure to remove request information"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by triggering DNS errors, leading to memory and CPU time consumption, and possibly blocking further DNS resolution.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks",
        "Triggering DNS errors"
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger DNS errors which are then handled by an application using JNDI, thereby exploiting a vulnerability in how the application handles the DNS resolution errors.",
       "Affected Component": "JNDI component of OpenJDK"
    }
  }
