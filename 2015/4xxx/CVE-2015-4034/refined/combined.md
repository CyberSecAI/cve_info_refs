### ZDI-15-256ZDI-CAN-2613

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-4034](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-4034) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.9, [AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |

| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Galaxy S5 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Samsung Galaxy S5s. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the com.absolute.android.persistence.MethodSpec Class. The createFromParcel() method performs dynamic class loading but does not restrict the source of the classes to be loaded. An attacker can craft a Parcelable object specifying arbitrary class files that will be loaded when the MethodSpec object is deserialized, resulting in remote code execution as the system user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  11/11/2015 - ZDI disclosed this report from Mobile Pwn2Own to the vendor11/11/2015 - The vendor re-sent ZDI an encryption key11/11/2015 - ZDI then re-disclosed this report from Mobile Pwn2Own to the vendor03/13/2015 - ZDI requested a status update05/13/2015 - ZDI requested a status update05/18/2015 - ZDI requested a status update  -- Vendor Response:  Fixes for both issues ZDI-CAN-2613 and ZDI-CAN-2614 require FOTA updates from carriers, such that there is no link to a patch for these fixes. While we believe only a small number of devices haven't received the software (FOTA) update from their respective carriers, there are number of devices still at risk from those vulnerabilities. |
