| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-11 13:46:36 UTC  ``` All Elasticsearch versions from 1.0.0 to 1.5.2 are vulnerable to an attack that uses Elasticsearch to modify files read and executed by certain other applications. Upstream bug/commit unknown at the time of writing.  Mitigation: =========== Users should upgrade to 1.6.0. Alternately, ensure that other applications are not present on the system, or that Elasticsearch cannot write into areas where these applications would read.  External References:  <https://www.elastic.co/community/security/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-06-11 13:48:02 UTC  ```  Created elasticsearch tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1230765](show_bug.cgi?id=1230765 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2015-4165 elasticsearch: unspecified arbitrary files modification vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-10 17:25:00 UTC  ``` Additional information:  <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elasticsearch-engineered-attack-vulnerability-cve-2015-4165/2256>  Summary: Elasticsearch versions 1.0.0 - 1.5.2 are vulnerable to an engineered attack on other applications on the system. The snapshot API may be used indirectly to place snapshot metadata files into locations that are writeable by the user running the Elasticsearch process. It is possible to create a file that another application could read and take action on, such as code execution.  This vulnerability requires several conditions to be exploited. There must be some other application running on the system that would read Lucene files and execute code from them. That application must also be accessible to the attacker, e.g. over the network. Lastly, the Java VM running the Elasticsearch process must be able to write into a location that the other application will read and potentially execute.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-10 19:21:40 UTC  ``` The upstream issue, pull and commit are:  <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/11068>  <https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/11284>  <https://github.com/imotov/elasticsearch/commit/f5cfb2a1869d1a52930cbd3138278a6e2c1b22e6>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-11 00:19:50 UTC  ``` For Satellite 6 the install documents:  <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Satellite/6.0/html-single/Installation_Guide/index.html#sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Installation_Guide-Red_Hat_Satellite_Installation-Configuring_Red_Hat_Satellite_Manually>  include firewalling elasticseach so that only the foreman, katello and root users can connect. As such this reduces exposure of elasticsearch significantly.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-14 03:21:33 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  For Satellite 6.x and Sam 1.x you can simply firewall elasticsearch to trusted users only (e.g. root, katello, foreman). For instructions on this please see:  <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Satellite/6.0/html-single/Installation_Guide/index.html#sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Installation_Guide-Red_Hat_Satellite_Installation-Configuring_Red_Hat_Satellite_Manually>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-14 03:30:30 UTC  ``` Updating the severity, for Sam 1.x elasticsearch only listens on localhost, thus local access is required. For Satellite 6.x the installation process should include firewalling it to trusted local users only. As such this only scores 3.3 instead of 5.8 on the CVSS2 scoring.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1230761#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-14 03:32:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of elasticsearch as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6.x and Subscription Asset Manager 1.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).
