Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4683:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of session IDs in HTTP GET parameters when performing certain actions on the Polycom RealPresence Resource Manager (RPRM) web interface, specifically during Excel and log file downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session ID Exposure:** Session IDs are transmitted via GET parameters, making them visible in URLs and potentially stored in web server logs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Web server logs, which contain these session IDs, can be accessed by unprivileged attackers via another vulnerability (Arbitrary file disclosure - vulnerability #2).
*   **Lack of Session Protection:** Session IDs, which should be treated as sensitive, are not handled securely

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining a valid session ID from a privileged user's webserver logs, an attacker can impersonate that user, gaining access to their privileges within the RPRM web interface.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This access can lead to further exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Surveillance:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, attackers could gain access to conference details, passcodes and even record conferences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation targets the RPRM web interface.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests that include the session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privileged user on the system to exploit the arbitrary file download vulnerability to gain access to the webserver logs.
*   **Web Server Log Access:** The attacker needs to be able to read the web server logs to obtain a privileged user's session ID
* **Same Source IP:** Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have the same source IP as the victim due to source IP binding of session IDs. This would typically be accomplished by an attacker being on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory explicitly mentions that the success of this exploit depends on the attacker having the same source IP address as the privileged victim due to session ID binding to source IP. This suggests that NAT (Network Address Translation) or a shared network environment would likely be required for a successful attack.
