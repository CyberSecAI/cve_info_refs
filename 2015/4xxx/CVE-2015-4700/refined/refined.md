Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in a flaw in the BPF JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler on x86 architecture. Specifically, the JIT compiler fails to properly handle specially crafted BPF instructions during the optimization process, resulting in a final compiled image filled with 'int 3' instructions. This happens because the x86 architecture has variable length encoding, which can cause jump targets to change across multiple passes over the program, and some programs might converge on the last iteration, without the JIT compiler completing a final iteration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Improper Optimization:** The core weakness is the JIT compiler's inadequate handling of specific instruction sequences, leading to incomplete or incorrect compilation.
-   **Lack of Final Iteration:** The JIT compiler's failure to ensure a final pass over the compiled image if convergence occurs in the last iteration.
- **Bad Instruction Creation:** Creation of bad instructions due to incomplete optimization that results in a CPU crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Kernel crash (Denial of Service):** Exploitation leads to the generation of faulty instructions that crash the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Local user exploitation:**  A local, unprivileged user can trigger this vulnerability by creating a packet filter with specially crafted BPF instructions on a socket that is also accepting incoming traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Local access:** The attacker must have the ability to create BPF packet filters on the targeted system.

**Additional details:**

-   The issue is related to how the JIT compiler attempts to optimize x86 instructions by selecting the shortest encoding, which involves multiple passes that sometimes may not converge correctly, and cause generation of int 3 instructions.
- The vulnerability is described as a BPF JIT optimization flaw that could allow local users to panic the kernel.
-  Multiple SUSE Security Advisories and OpenSUSE Security Updates mention the fix for CVE-2015-4700.
-  The fix involves modifying the JIT compiler to ensure a final iteration in the compilation process to mitigate the issue.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a local denial-of-service vulnerability caused by a flaw in the Linux kernel's BPF JIT compiler on x86 architecture, which allows a local attacker to cause a kernel panic through specially crafted BPF instructions.
