Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input escaping in IBM Business Process Manager dashboards. This improper handling of user-supplied input allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a persistent XSS vulnerability. This means the injected script is stored within the application, and is executed when other users access the affected content.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting:** There's also a reflected XSS component, where a specially crafted URL can be used to execute the script within the user's browser after the URL is clicked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials, enabling them to hijack user sessions.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** By executing scripts, an attacker might be able to steal sensitive data or manipulate the application's behavior on behalf of the victim.
- **Reputation Damage:** Exploitation can lead to unauthorized actions, potentially harming the reputation of the affected organization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URLs:** A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability using specially crafted URLs. The victim would need to click on the malicious link to trigger the execution of the injected script.
- **HTML Tags in Fields:** Attackers can insert malicious scripts within HTML tags in various fields of the Process Portal dashboards. This includes fields within the "Mentions" tab and fields within the "Following" tab when using <img> tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to access the IBM Business Process Manager application remotely, either directly or via an intermediary.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to click a malicious URL.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know where to inject the malicious scripts to be effective
