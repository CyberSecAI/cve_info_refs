* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  As a manager, you open the Team Performance dashboard and select
  a team. You click the Tasks tab and then the blue reassign
  button. You hover the mouse over the user name and notice that
  the tooltip shows a different user.  Additionally, tasks are
  assigned to an incorrect user, which is the user displayed in
  the tooltip.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  When a user has a numeric name that is the same as the IBM
  BPM-generated user ID of another user, the Team Performance
  dashboard incorrectly retrieves the user data by using the
  numeric name field instead of the IBM BPM User ID field. As a
  result, the tooltip to displays the name of the other user.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM V8.5.5.0 that correctly retrieves
  the user data specifically by using the IBM BPM User ID field.

  On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
