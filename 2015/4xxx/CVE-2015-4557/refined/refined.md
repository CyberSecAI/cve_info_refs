The provided content relates to CVE-2015-4557.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `redirect_to` parameter in the "Nextend Twitter Connect" and "Nextend Google Connect" WordPress plugins. Specifically, the code does not escape HTML tags or other dangerous symbols before outputting the `redirect_to` parameter in the generated HTML for login buttons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `redirect_to` parameter of the "Nextend Twitter Connect" and "Nextend Google Connect" WordPress plugins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `redirect_to` parameter. This code will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `redirect_to` parameter.
- The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL. This could be achieved through:
    - Email phishing campaigns.
    - Embedding the malicious URL in a website or advertisement.
    - Social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker must be able to trick the victim into accessing the malicious URL.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 1.5.1 of the "Nextend Twitter Connect" and "Nextend Google Connect" plugins.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.5.2 of both plugins by using `esc_url` to properly escape the URL.
- The plugins have been closed and are no longer available for download.
