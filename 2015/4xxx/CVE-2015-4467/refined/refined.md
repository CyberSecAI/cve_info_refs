Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error that occurs during CHM file decompression within the `libmspack` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A division by zero error in the `chmd_init_decomp` function within `mspack/chmd.c` during CHM decompression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a program crash due to a SIGFPE (Floating Point Exception). This denial-of-service condition can be triggered when processing a specially crafted CHM file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted CHM file designed to trigger the division-by-zero during decompression.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious CHM file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found using American fuzzy lop (AFL) which is a fuzzer to find such bugs.
- The vulnerability affects the `libmspack` library and also impacts applications like ClamAV that embed or use `libmspack`.
- A patch was provided to fix this issue which prevents the division by zero and was included in `libmspack` version 0.4-3.
