- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `MulticastAddr` method of the `Ipropsapi.ipropsapiCtrl.1` ActiveX control due to insufficient bounds checking when handling overly long strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by a user visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted string passed to the vulnerable `MulticastAddr` method of the ActiveX control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to convince a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file. The attacker can be remote.
