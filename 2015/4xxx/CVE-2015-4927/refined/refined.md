- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Weak file permissions are set during the installation of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager on Linux and AIX systems, resulting in world-writable files with root ownership.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The primary vulnerability is the existence of world-writable files and directories, which allows any user on the system to modify them. This is particularly dangerous when these files are owned by root. The vulnerability stems from the secureMain command, which, when run without parameters, sets overly permissive permissions on a number of directories, and when used with specific parameters, it can unintentionally skip security settings on some components.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation. An attacker could modify these world-writable files to gain elevated privileges on the system by manipulating files or directories with root ownership.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An attacker needs to have an account on the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a local user account on the affected Linux or AIX system where IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Tivoli Storage Manager is installed.
