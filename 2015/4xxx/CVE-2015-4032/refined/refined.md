- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Developer tools of Visual Mining NetCharts Server. Specifically, the `projectContents.jsp` page allows an attacker to rename arbitrary files, including uploaded ones. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by renaming and executing an uploaded file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload, arbitrary file rename, and arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability exists in the developer tools, which are accessible without authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the vulnerable server. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (remote). An attacker sends a specially crafted request to the `projectContents.jsp` page to rename a previously uploaded file and execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need the ability to interact with the vulnerable `projectContents.jsp` page.
