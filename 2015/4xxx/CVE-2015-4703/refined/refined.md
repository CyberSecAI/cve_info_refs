Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-4703:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `mysqldump_download.php` file of the "wp-instance-rename" WordPress plugin. This file downloads a database dump, but it fails to properly sanitize or validate the `dumpfname` parameter, which specifies the file to be downloaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server. The `mysqldump_download.php` script directly uses the unsanitized `dumpfname` parameter in `file_exists()` and `addFile()` functions without verifying that the provided path is within the intended backup directory or if it is a valid file to be downloaded..

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can download sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or other private data. In the example provided, the attacker attempts to download `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `mysqldump_download.php` with malicious values for `dbname`, `dumpfname`, and `backup_folder` parameters.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `dumpfname` parameter to point to a file they wish to download instead of a database dump.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require any prior authentication or authorization with the WordPress application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from `mysqldump_download.php` is as follows:

```php
try{
	$dbname   = $_GET["dbname"];
	$dumpfname = $_GET["dumpfname"];
	$backup_folder = $_GET["backup_folder"];
}catch (Exception $e){}

if(empty($backup_folder)){
	$backup_folder="backup/";
}
echo "$dumpfname";
if (file_exists($dumpfname)) {
	// zip the dump file
	$name=$dbname . "_" . date("Y-m-d");
	$zipfname = $backup_folder.$name.".zip";
	$zip = new ZipArchive();
	if($zip->open($zipfname,ZIPARCHIVE::CREATE))
	{
	   $zip->addFile($dumpfname,$dumpfname);
	   $zip->close();
	}
	// read zip file and send it to standard output
	if (file_exists($zipfname)) {
		header('Content-Description: File Transfer');
		header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream');
		header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='.basename($zipfname));
		flush();
		readfile($zipfname);
```

The critical issue here is the direct usage of `$dumpfname` in `file_exists()` and `$zip->addFile()` without any path validation or sanitization.

**Exploit Example:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates how to download `/etc/passwd` by sending the following curl request:

```bash
curl --data "dbname=wp&dumpfname=/etc/passwd&backup_folder=."  <http://www.example.com/wp-instance-rename/mysqldump_download.php> -o p.zip
```
This request sets `dumpfname` to `/etc/passwd` and `backup_folder` to `.`, forcing the server to attempt to zip and download `/etc/passwd`.
