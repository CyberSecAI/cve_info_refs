Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4515:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2015-4515 and explicitly describes a vulnerability in Firefox related to NTLM authentication, matching the CVE description. The bug report from Bugzilla ([Bug 1046421](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1046421)) is also directly linked and confirms the NTLM related information disclosure issue.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inclusion of the client's hostname in the "Workstation" field of an NTLM type 3 message, which is sent during NTLM-based HTTP authentication. This occurs because Firefox was populating this field with the actual hostname rather than a generic placeholder.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that the client's hostname is exposed during NTLM authentication, even when NTLMv1 is disabled. This is a violation of user privacy.
*   **NTLMv1 Weakness:** While NTLMv1 is disabled by default, the vulnerability exists when it is enabled or where it is being negotiated.
*   **Silent Exploitation**: The vulnerability can be silently triggered by an attacker using an iframe with a crafted URL.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can discover a user's hostname, which can be used for tracking purposes. The domain information, may also be leaked depending on the environment.
*   **Tracking:** The hostname disclosure allows for user tracking across the internet, even when behind a firewall, proxy or when using private modes. This also creates possibilities for unmasking VPN or TOR users.
*   **NTLM Replay**: Insecure NTLM responses may be subject to replay or brute-force attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted web page/iframe:** A malicious website, embedded in an iframe or similar mechanism, triggers an NTLM request by embedding credentials within the URL.
*   **Silent NTLM negotiation:**  The negotiation happens silently, without any user prompt, when a crafted website makes a request to a server that uses NTLM authentication (e.g., an attacker controlled server).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and/or control a web server to respond to NTLM negotiation requests.
*   **Ability to induce NTLM negotiation:** The attacker needs to create an HTML page, iframe, or similar technique to force the browser to initiate the NTLM handshake.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved adding a preference (`network.generic-ntlm-auth.workstation`) to control the content of the workstation field (defaults to `WORKSTATION`).
*   The vulnerability is specific to how Firefox populates the NTLM 'Workstation' field and could leak domain information in some cases.
*   Other browsers are also mentioned to be affected, but specific fixes and details are absent in this context.
*   The bug report suggests that the risk of exploitation is low, however the impact is high for specific user groups.
*   The vulnerability exists even if javascript is disabled.
