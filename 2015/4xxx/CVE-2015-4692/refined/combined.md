CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1333 CVE-2015-3212 CVE-2015-4692 CVE-2015-4700
                 CVE-2015-5364 CVE-2015-5366 CVE-2015-5697 CVE-2015-5706
                 CVE-2015-5707

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.

CVE-2015-1333

    Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the
    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

CVE-2015-3212

    Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-4692

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
    resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-4700

    Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
    crash the system.

CVE-2015-5364

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.

CVE-2015-5366

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.

CVE-2015-5697

    A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.

CVE-2015-5706

    An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-5707

    An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. CVE-2015-1333, CVE-2015-4692 and
CVE-2015-5706 do not affect the wheezy distribution.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except CVE-2015-5364 and CVE-2015-5366
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

An update that solves 21 vulnerabilities and has 8 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE 13.2 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
Following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2015-3290: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernels nested NMI
handler and espfix64 functionalities interacted during NMI processing. A
local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
- CVE-2015-3212: A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux
kernels SCTP implementation handled Address Configuration lists when
performing Address Configuration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could
use this flaw to crash the system via a race condition triggered by
setting certain ASCONF options on a socket.
- CVE-2015-5364: A remote denial of service (hang) via UDP flood with
incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-5366: A remote denial of service (unexpected error returns) via
UDP flood with incorrect package checksums was fixed. (bsc#936831).
- CVE-2015-4700: A local user could have created a bad instruction in the
JIT processed BPF code, leading to a kernel crash (bnc#935705).
- CVE-2015-1420: Race condition in the handle\_to\_path function in
fs/fhandle.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to bypass intended
size restrictions and trigger read operations on additional memory
locations by changing the handle\_bytes value of a file handle during the
execution of this function (bnc#915517).
- CVE-2015-4692: The kvm\_apic\_has\_events function in arch/x86/kvm/lapic.h
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified
other impact by leveraging /dev/kvm access for an ioctl call
(bnc#935542).
- CVE-2015-4167 CVE-2014-9728 CVE-2014-9730 CVE-2014-9729 CVE-2014-9731:
Various problems in the UDF filesystem were fixed that could lead to
crashes when mounting prepared udf filesystems.
- CVE-2015-4002: drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver
in the Linux kernel did not ensure that certain length values are
sufficiently large, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (system crash or large loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code
via a crafted packet, related to the (1) oz\_usb\_rx and (2)
oz\_usb\_handle\_ep\_data functions (bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4003: The oz\_usb\_handle\_ep\_data function in
drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver in the Linux
kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(divide-by-zero error and system crash) via a crafted packet
(bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4001: Integer signedness error in the oz\_hcd\_get\_desc\_cnf
function in drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozhcd.c in the OZWPAN driver in the
Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet
(bnc#933934).
- CVE-2015-4036: A potential memory corruption in vhost/scsi was fixed.
- CVE-2015-2922: The ndisc\_router\_discovery function in net/ipv6/ndisc.c
in the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack
in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to reconfigure a hop-limit
setting via a small hop\_limit value in a Router Advertisement (RA)
message (bnc#922583).
- CVE-2015-3636: It was found that the Linux kernels ping socket
implementation did not properly handle socket unhashing during spurious
disconnects, which could lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64
architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use
this flaw to crash the system. On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a
local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to escalate
their privileges on the system.
- CVE-2015-2041: net/llc/sysctl\_net\_llc.c in the Linux kernel used an
incorrect data type in a sysctl table, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory or possibly
have unspecified other impact by accessing a sysctl entry (bnc#919007).
- CVE-2015-3339: Race condition in the prepare\_binprm function in
fs/exec.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges by
executing a setuid program at a time instant when a chown to root is in
progress, and the ownership is changed but the setuid bit is not yet
stripped.
- CVE-2015-1465: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly consider the length of the Read-Copy Update (RCU) grace period
for redirecting lookups in the absence of caching, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or system
crash) via a flood of packets (bnc#916225).

# USN-2682-1: Linux kernel (Utopic HWE) vulnerabilities

23 July 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's

kvm\_apic\_has\_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](/security/CVE-2015-4692))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-vivid](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-vivid) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Vivid

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's

kvm\_apic\_has\_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](/security/CVE-2015-4692))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter

JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](/security/CVE-2015-4700))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# CVE-2015-4700

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-4696.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-4706.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-4700 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4700)

#### Description

The bpf\_int\_jit\_compile function in arch/x86/net/bpf\_jit\_comp.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by creating a packet filter and then loading crafted BPF instructions that trigger late convergence by the JIT compiler.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [moderate](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

[CVSS v2 Scores](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm)

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue affects BPF JIT optimisation which was added in Linux Kernel 3.0. Older kernels are not affected, so SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 and older products/service packs are not affected.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [935705](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=935705) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [939273](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=939273) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2684-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

23 July 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem's

kvm\_apic\_has\_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](/security/CVE-2015-4692))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel's BPF filter

JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](/security/CVE-2015-4700))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums.

([CVE-2015-5364](/security/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP

checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against

applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid

checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](/security/CVE-2015-5366))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)
* [linux-image-3.19.0-23-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.19.0-23.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.19.0-23.24)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
