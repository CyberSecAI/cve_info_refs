      "root_cause": "Variable coverage vulnerability in the installation script allows overwriting predefined variables with user-supplied input.",

      "impact": "Remote code execution. By exploiting the variable coverage vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite critical variables such as `$install_demo_name` and `$updateHost`. This allows them to clear the contents of `config_update.php` and then use a crafted request to write arbitrary PHP code to a file on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests to the `/install/index.php` or `/install/index.php.bak` files. The attacker manipulates parameters such as `step`, `insLockfile`, `s_lang`, `install_demo_name`, and `updateHost`.",
