- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `saveFile.jsp` page within the development installation of Visual Mining NetCharts Server does not properly validate user-supplied input when handling file paths. Specifically, it lacks sufficient checks to prevent directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary file overwrite, leading to remote code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker can send a crafted request to the vulnerable `saveFile.jsp` page to overwrite any file on the server file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
