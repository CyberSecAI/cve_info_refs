Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from two weaknesses in the password change functionality of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing application:
    *   Users are not required to enter their previous password when requesting a password change.
    *   The HTTP session functionality does not validate the session ID in the HTTP request for a password change.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Previous Password Check:** The application fails to verify the user's existing password before allowing a password reset. This allows an attacker to change a user's password without any prior knowledge.
*   **Session ID Validation Failure:** The application does not validate the session ID included in a password change request. This allows an attacker to potentially forge a request and bypass authentication.
*   **CWE-20:** The advisory also identifies CWE-20, which refers to improper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Password Change:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can change the passwords of arbitrary users.
*   **Full Control of the Application:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use the reset credentials to gain full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the application.
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability and can initiate the attack remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send HTTP requests with the required malicious data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 10.0 and a temporal score of 8.3.
*   **Affected Products:** All versions of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing prior to 8.6 are vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability in versions 8.5(5) MR3 and 8.6(2).
*   **No Workaround:** There is no workaround available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing, and there are no known public announcements or malicious use of it.
