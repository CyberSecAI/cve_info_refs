The provided content is a request for CVE IDs for multiple vulnerabilities in Drupal contributed modules. CVE-2015-4361 is not explicitly mentioned but it is one of the CVEs assigned to the issues listed in this email. Based on the content, here's the breakdown:

**Vulnerabilities Identified (related to CVE-2015-4361)**

The email lists multiple Drupal contributed modules with different types of vulnerabilities:

*   **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**:  Multiple modules are affected by XSS vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Open Redirect:** Some modules suffer from open redirect vulnerabilities, where an attacker can redirect users to a malicious website.
*   **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Several modules are vulnerable to CSRF attacks, enabling an attacker to perform unwanted actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge.
*  **Access Bypass**: Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to bypass access controls and access resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to.
* **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** One module, Avatar Uploader, has an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability, which is a high severity vulnerability.
* **Arbitrary file deletion**: One module, Spider Video Player, has an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability, which allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server.
* **SQL Injection:** One module, Spider Contacts, has a SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Information Disclosure**: The Services module and HybridAuth Social Login are vulnerable to information disclosure.

**Specific Modules Mentioned (Relevant to CVE-2015-4361 based on Drupal.org's security advisories)**

Based on Drupal.org's security advisories, the following module and vulnerability mentioned in the email relates to CVE-2015-4361:

*   **SA-CONTRIB-2015-048 - Avatar Uploader - Arbitrary PHP code execution** : This is the most relevant to this CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (SA-CONTRIB-2015-048)**

The vulnerability in the Avatar Uploader module stems from insecure handling of file uploads. The module does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing users to upload files with malicious PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities (SA-CONTRIB-2015-048)**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The module lacks proper checks on the type and content of uploaded files.
*   **Insecure File Handling:**  Uploaded files are not properly sanitized or stored in a way that prevents execution.

**Impact of Exploitation (SA-CONTRIB-2015-048)**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted PHP file, which would be executed by the server, allowing the attacker to take control of the web server, execute arbitrary system commands, steal sensitive data, deface the site, etc.

**Attack Vectors (SA-CONTRIB-2015-048)**

*   **File Upload:** An attacker needs to upload a malicious PHP file via the Avatar Uploader module's file upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position (SA-CONTRIB-2015-048)**

*   **User Account:** An attacker needs a user account with permission to upload an avatar.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerability**: The attacker needs to be aware that this module allows upload of PHP files.

**Summary of CVE-2015-4361**

CVE-2015-4361 is specifically related to the arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability in the Avatar Uploader module. The module's failure to properly sanitize file uploads allows an attacker to gain control of the server.
