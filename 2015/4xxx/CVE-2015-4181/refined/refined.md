Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2015-4180), which itself was an incomplete fix for an earlier vulnerability (CVE-2009-4050). The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when requesting files, specifically in how the application handles path traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on file access by using path traversal sequences like `../` in the filename, enabling access to files outside the intended directory.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The fix in version 2.5 attempted to block the exploit but it was incomplete because it only addressed filename suffixes instead of properly sanitizing the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download specific configuration files. This could expose sensitive information contained within those files, such as database credentials or other configuration details. Although the description specifies configuration files, it does note that other files with approved extensions can also be downloaded but this is intentional behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker constructs a crafted URL that includes path traversal sequences (`../../files/../files/`) followed by a target filename with a `.php` extension to download specific configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or further requirements are explicitly stated in the provided text.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
*   The presumed affected versions are at least 2.1 through 2.5.
