Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `collect_mounts` function within the Linux kernel's namespace handling. This function, used by the audit subsystem, doesn't properly handle cases where a mount point is unmounted while being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition exists when a user attempts to umount a mount point while the kernel's audit subsystem is trying to collect information about that same mount point.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  If the mount point is unmounted during processing in `collect_mounts`, it can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when `copy_tree` is called on the now invalid path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged user within a user namespace can trigger a kernel panic by calling `umount(MNT_DETACH)` on a specific mount point while an audit process is collecting information about it. This can crash the entire system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, this vulnerability could potentially be chained with other exploits to achieve privilege escalation due to the ability to trigger kernel panics from user space, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unprivileged User:** The attack can be launched by an unprivileged user within a user namespace.
*   **`umount(MNT_DETACH)` system call:** The attacker must call the `umount()` system call with the flag `MNT_DETACH` set to unmount a path.
*   **Audit Subsystem:** The attacker needs to trigger the audit subsystem on the target mount point to expose the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Namespace:** The attacker must be within a user namespace (CONFIG\_USER\_NS must be enabled in kernel).
*   **Basic System Call Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute system calls, specifically `umount()`.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to cause the race between the umount and the audit subsystem operation on the same mount point.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is a regression introduced in Linux kernel 4.0.2 and fixed in 4.0.5.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Drew Fisher of Fedora Security Team, Kenton Varda, Alexander Larsson, and Eric Biederman.
*   Red Hat has stated that this issue doesn't affect RHEL 5, 6, MRG-2, real-time, or arm kernels.
