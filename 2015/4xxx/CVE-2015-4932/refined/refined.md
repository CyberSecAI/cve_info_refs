Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-4932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. It occurs when processing opcode 1365 related to handling a list of Files Restore Agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A crafted packet sent on TCP port 11460 can cause a stack buffer overflow during the processing of opcode 1365. This overflow happens when the application handles a list of Files Restore Agents.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication. This means that any attacker on the network can attempt to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **SYSTEM Level Privileges:** The attacker can gain code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user, which is the highest privilege level in Windows.
*   **Server Crash**: The vulnerability may cause the server to crash

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **TCP Port 11460:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted packet to the vulnerable server on TCP port 11460.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Send Crafted Packets:** The attacker must be able to generate and send a crafted TCP packet on port 11460 that triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any prior authentication to the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack versions 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.12.0.
*   A fix is available in version 6.1.12.1 and later.
