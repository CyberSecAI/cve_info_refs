{
  "CVE-2015-4651": {
    "Description": "The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.6 does not properly determine whether enough memory is available for storing IP address strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper memory allocation check within the dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function when handling WCCP packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of available memory for IP address strings, leading to a potential buffer overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition by sending a crafted WCCP packet that causes an application crash due to memory corruption or resource exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack; attackers can send crafted WCCP packets over a network or convince someone to open a malicious pcap file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Wireshark instance or have the victim open a malicious pcap file."
  },
   "CVE-2015-4652": {
    "Description": "epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_a_dtap.c in the GSM DTAP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.6 does not properly validate digit characters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet, related to the de_emerg_num_list and de_bcd_num functions.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation of digit characters within the GSM DTAP dissector, specifically in the de_emerg_num_list and de_bcd_num functions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper checks on the validity of digit characters, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially memory corruption when processing GSM DTAP packets.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a crafted GSM DTAP packet to a vulnerable Wireshark instance, resulting in an application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack; attackers send malformed GSM DTAP packets over a network or convince a user to open a malicious pcap file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be capable of sending network traffic or providing a malicious pcap file that contains the malformed GSM DTAP packet."
