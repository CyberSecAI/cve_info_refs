### Relevant Information:
The provided content discusses a vulnerability in eFront CMS v3.6.15.4 related to bypassing blocked extension file uploads, which aligns with CVE-2015-4463.

**Vulnerability:** Bypass for Blocked Extension File Uploads

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses a blacklist to prevent the upload of certain file types (e.g., php, jsp, exe). This blacklist validation can be bypassed by adding an additional parameter to the end of the URL.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application validates the file extension of the given URL, but this validation can be bypassed.
*   **Attack Vector:** By adding an additional parameter (e.g., `login=test`) to the end of the URL when uploading a remote file, the extension-based validation is bypassed.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload files with restricted extensions (like PHP) to the server. Although the initial attempt to upload a PHP file results in the HTML code of the executed file on the attacker's domain being saved on the target server, the attacker can craft a PHP file that outputs PHP code. This allows the attacker to store and execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user with "Professor" role privileges. The attacker needs to host a malicious file (e.g., phpinfo.php) on a separate, attacker-controlled server.

**Affected versions:** eFront CMS versions prior to 3.6.15.5 build 18024.
