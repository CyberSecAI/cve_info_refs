Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-4063:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The exploit-db content explicitly mentions CVE-2015-4063 and describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the NewStatPress plugin. This aligns with the CVE ID.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**
   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input within the `includes/nsp_search.php` file, specifically when processing the `where` parameter in the search functionality.
   - **Weakness:**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `$_GET["where$i"]` parameter before using it in the HTML output, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
   - **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected script is stored and then executed when the affected page is loaded.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's search page. When a user visits this page, the injected script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
        - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies
        - Defacement: Changing the appearance of the page
        - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites
        - Keylogging: capturing keystrokes from users
   - **Attack Vectors:**
        - The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `where` parameter.
        - An authenticated WordPress user with access to the NewStatPress plugin's search functionality (typically an administrator or editor) must be tricked into visiting the malicious URL.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious script in the `where` parameter.
        - The attacker needs to have some knowledge of WordPress.
        - They need to trick an authenticated user into visiting the crafted URL

**3. Technical Details:**

   - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
     ```php
     for($i=1;$i<=3;$i++) {
        if($_GET["where$i"] != '') { print "<th scope='col'>".ucfirst($_GET["where$i"])."</th>"; }
      }
      ```
   - This code directly outputs the unsanitized `$_GET["where$i"]` parameter within HTML tags.

**4. Additional Notes:**

* The provided content also mentions a SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2015-4062) in the same plugin, also related to the search functionality of the plugin. This information is relevant but does not pertain to CVE-2015-4063 specifically.
* The content mentions that version 0.9.8 is vulnerable, and the issue is fixed in version 0.9.9.
* The XSS vulnerability requires an authenticated user to trigger.
* The changelog of the plugin indicates that version 1.2.5 addresses a stored XSS vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2015-4063 is a Stored XSS vulnerability in the NewStatPress WordPress plugin, caused by improper sanitization of the `where` parameter in the search functionality. Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user's browser.
