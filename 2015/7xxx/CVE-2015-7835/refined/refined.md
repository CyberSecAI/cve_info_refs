```
(CVE) ID: CVE-2015-7835
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `mod_l2_entry` function in `arch/x86/mm.c` in Xen. This function is responsible for handling requests from PV (Paravirtualized) guests to update their page table mappings. The issue is caused by insufficient validation of Level 2 page table entries, specifically when superpage mappings are involved. Due to how `L2_DISALLOW_MASK` is initialized,  attackers can request the setting of (PSE | RW) bits in the L2 PDE. This makes the whole L1 table accessible to the guest with R/W rights. Subsequently, the guest can modify one or more of the PTEs to point to an arbitrary MFN, allowing them to access any system memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Insufficient Validation:** The `mod_l2_entry` function does not adequately validate the page table entries, allowing the setting of the `_PAGE_PSE` bit with `_PAGE_RW` which is a privilege escalation.
-   **Superpage Mapping Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered through the use of superpage mappings in PV guests, which can be manipulated due to the lack of restrictions in the `L2_DISALLOW_MASK`.
-   **Lack of Preemption:** The Xen code was not preemptible, allowing the linear scan of the guest address space, consuming CPU and causing a potential denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Privilege Escalation:** A local PV guest administrator can gain complete control of the system by exploiting the vulnerability.
-   **Arbitrary Memory Access:** A malicious guest can access any physical memory on the host system by manipulating page table entries.
-   **Reliable Attack:** The attack is reliable and effective, bypassing intended security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by a local PV guest administrator.
-   **Crafted Superpage Mapping:** The attacker creates a crafted superpage mapping that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **PV Guest Administrator:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within a paravirtualized Xen guest.
-   **Ability to Manipulate Page Tables:** The attacker needs the capability to request modifications to their own page table mappings within the guest OS.
-  **Basic understanding** of memory mapping with page tables, L2 entries, and PTEs

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was present in Xen 3.4 through 4.6.x.
*   The vulnerability affects only x86 systems, and only PV guests can exploit it.
* The attack works irrespective of the `opt_allow_superpage` setting.

This vulnerability is considered an important security risk due to the potential for privilege escalation and complete system compromise. The provided content also details fixes made to various SUSE and openSUSE products.
