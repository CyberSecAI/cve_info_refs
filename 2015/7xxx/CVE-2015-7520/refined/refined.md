- **Root cause of vulnerability:** JavaScript statements can break out of a RadioGroup's and CheckBoxMultipleChoice's "value" attribute of `<input>` elements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  If the JavaScript contains user-provided data, it might pose a security threat. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the "value" attribute of `<input>` elements within RadioGroup and CheckBoxMultipleChoice form controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject user-provided data into the application that would end up in the `value` attribute of the affected HTML elements.
