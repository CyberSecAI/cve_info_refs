{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-7539",
    "description": "While the Jenkins update site data is digitally signed, and the signature verified by Jenkins, Jenkins did not verify the provided SHA-1 checksums for the plugin files referenced in the update site data. This enabled MITM attacks on the plugin manager, resulting in installation of attacker-provided plugins.",
    "affected_versions": "All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 1.640, All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.625.2",
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Jenkins 1.641",
      "Jenkins 1.625.3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Jenkins plugin manager did not verify SHA-1 checksums of plugin files referenced in the update site data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing integrity check"
    ],
    "impact": "Installation of attacker-provided plugins, arbitrary code execution",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network path between Jenkins and the update site"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to manipulate network traffic"
    ]
