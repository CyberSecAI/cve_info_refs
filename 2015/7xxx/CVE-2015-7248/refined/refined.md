Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information due to inadequate protection mechanisms. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from two primary issues:
1. Usernames and password hashes are embedded within the HTML source code of a web page.
2. The device's configuration file stores usernames, passwords, keys, and other sensitive values in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** Sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes are exposed within the HTML page source, and the device's configuration file stores sensitive information in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain usernames and password hashes, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the device's web interface and other services.
*   The exposure of configuration data could allow lower-privileged users to escalate their access and gain full admin control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Web Interface:** An attacker on the same LAN can access the web interface of the router and view the page source.
*   **Access to Configuration File:** An attacker with some level of access to the router's file system can read the plain-text configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **LAN Access:** The primary attack vector requires an attacker to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** An attacker needs basic web knowledge to view the source code of the page.
*   **Low Privileges (For Config File):** For configuration file access, an attacker would need a low privileged access to the router file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A and ZXV10 W300 routers.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-200: Information Exposure.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) details for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   The vendor released a fix for the H108N model but not for the W300 model, recommending users to replace the device.

This analysis provides more details than the basic CVE description by detailing the exact location of the exposed credentials (HTML source, config file), the impact, and the attacker's position and capabilities required for successful exploitation.
