The provided content relates to CVE-2015-7291.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The web management interface of ARRIS cable modems is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Specifically, the `adv_pwd_cgi` parameter is susceptible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in the `adv_pwd_cgi` parameter of the web management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that is triggered by the victim user while they have an active session with the web management interface.
- The victim needs to be tricked into loading the crafted malicious request, usually through a link or a visited web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`adv_pwd_cgi`).
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user with an active session on the modem web interface to trigger the malicious request, usually via social engineering (tricking them into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page).
