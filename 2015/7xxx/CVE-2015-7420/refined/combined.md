# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit 8 affect Tivoli Directory Server and IBM Security Directory Server for AIX/VIOS (CVE-2015-7421, CVE-2015-7420)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Vulnerabilities were discovered in GSKit 8. Tivoli Directory Server and IBM Security Directory Server use GSKit 8 and have addressed the applicable CVE's. GSKit 7 is not affected.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID**: CVE-2015-7421: A vulnerability in GSKit could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The internal ICC PRNG pool state is duplicated during a fork() system call operation which results in a period of time where child processes may generate identical PRNG output to the parent. This may allow possible attacks related to predicable state which an attacker could exploit.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107695> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
