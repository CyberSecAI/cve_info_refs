Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The GSKit PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) state is duplicated during a `fork()` system call operation. This results in child processes generating identical PRNG output as the parent process for a period of time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Predictable PRNG output: Due to the state duplication during `fork()`, the PRNG becomes predictable because child processes may generate the same random numbers as their parent process, at least for a while.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information by exploiting the predictable nature of the PRNG. This could include cryptographic keys, session IDs, or other security-sensitive values generated using the PRNG.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker, with no requirement for the attacker to have prior access to the system.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the affected code path that generates random numbers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to remotely interact with the system, or have the capability of getting a child process to be spawned.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.

**Affected Products:**
- AIX 5.3, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2
- VIOS 2.2.x
- IBM MQ Appliance M2000

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to GSKit 8. GSKit 7 is not affected.
- The provided CVSS vector is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) which indicates a network attack vector, with a high attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction needed, no scope change, low confidentiality impact, and no impact to integrity or availability.
- Fixes are available from IBM, and should be applied.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available.
