Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7927:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding when creating or editing user information and tags. Specifically, the "User First Name", "User Last Name", "User Information", and "Tag Description" fields do not filter out HTML tags or Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows embedding of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code within the mentioned fields. This input is then stored and displayed back to users, leading to the execution of the injected script.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into user or tag fields.
*   When a user views these fields, the malicious script executes within their browser session.
*   This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, redirecting the user to malicious sites, engaging in network reconnaissance, and planting backdoor programs.
*   The injected script executes in the context of the userâ€™s browser session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to authenticate and have the ability to create or edit user or tag information via the web interface of the eWON device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid user account on the eWON device.
*   The attacker needs access to the eWON device's web interface.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability but marked it as "won't fix," stating that they allow HTML tags or JavaScript in form fields to meet specific user needs, and because other methods such as FTP upload can achieve similar results by modifying config files. They also argue a user needs to be authenticated to do so.

*   The vendor considers this a feature.

*   The ICS-CERT advisory describes Stored XSS and provides the relevant CWE.

* The vulnerability details from both sources align.
