{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded default account ('IntegrationUser') with administrator privileges and a known password ('plugin'). This account is hidden from the user interface and cannot be easily reset.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded credentials",
      "SQL query protection bypass",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM on the target system. This is achieved by writing a malicious WAR file to disk through SQL injection, which is then automatically deployed, granting the attacker shell access with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface login using default credentials",
      "SQL injection through the web form (/api/json/admin/SubmitQuery)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the ManageEngine OpManager web interface to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to know the default username ('IntegrationUser') and password ('plugin')."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "versions_affected": "ManageEngine OpManager versions v11.5 and previous versions up to v11.6 (tested on Windows)",
     "exploit_availability": "A Metasploit module is available for this vulnerability, facilitating exploitation.",
      "bypass_technique": "The SQL query protection bypass is achieved by injecting comments ('/**/') into SQL queries, circumventing the filter that blocks INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements."
