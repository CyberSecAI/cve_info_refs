### ManageEngine OpManager Remote Code Execution

Disclosed
09/14/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a
default hidden account "IntegrationUser" with administrator privileges exists. The account
has a default password of "plugin" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By
log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to
write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This
module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/http/manage_engine_opmanager_rce
msf exploit(manage_engine_opmanager_rce) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(manage_engine_opmanager_rce) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(manage_engine_opmanager_rce) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(manage_engine_opmanager_rce) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

# ManageEngine OpManager multiple vulnerabilities

Exploit Title: ManageEngine OpManager multiple vulnerabilities
Product: ManageEngine OpManager
Vulnerable Versions: v11.5 and previous versions
Tested Version: v11.5 (Windows)
Advisory Publication: 14/09/2015
Vulnerability Type: hardcoded credentials, SQL query protection bypass
Credit: xistence <xistence[at]0x90.nl>

Product Description
-------------------

ManageEngine OpManager is a network, server, and virtualization monitoring
software that helps SMEs, large enterprises and service providers manage
their data centers and IT infrastructure efficiently and cost effectively.
Automated workflows, intelligent alerting engines, configurable discovery
rules, and extendable templates enable IT teams to setup a 24x7 monitoring
system within hours of installation.
Do-it-yourself plug-ins extend the scope of management to include network
change and configuration management and IP address management as well as
monitoring of networks, applications, databases, virtualization and
NetFlow-based bandwidth.

Vulnerability Details
---------------------

ManageEngine OpManager ships with a default account "IntegrationUser" with
the password "plugin". This account is hidden from the user interface and
will never show up in the user management. Also changing the password for
this account is not possible by default. The account however is assigned
Administrator privileges and logging in with this account is possible via
the web interface.

Below you can see the account in the PostgreSQL database after a fresh
installation:

C:\ManageEngine\OpManager\pgsql\bin>psql.exe -h 127.0.0.1 -p 13306 -U
postgres -d OpManagerDB
psql (9.2.4)

OpManagerDB=# select * from userpasswordtable where userid = 2;
userid | username | password | ownername | domainname | sipenabled
--------+-----------------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------
2 | IntegrationUser | d7962CgyJ | NULL | NULL | false
(1 row)

The above password decrypted is "plugin".

Any account that has access to the web interface with Administrator rights
can use a web form (/api/json/admin/SubmitQuery) to execute SQL queries on
the backend PostgreSQL instance.
By default restrictions apply and queries that start with
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are not allowed to be executed, this is however very
easy to bypass by using something like "INSERT/**/INTO...". The "/**/"
comment will create a space and the function is not detected by OpManager's
protection and will be executed.

The PostgreSQL environment runs as SYSTEM under Windows. By writing a WAR
payload to the "tomcat/webroot" directory, the WAR payload will be deployed
automatically and will give a shell with SYSTEM privileges.

A metasploit module will be release shortly.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
