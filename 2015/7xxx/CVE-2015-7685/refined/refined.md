The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in GLPI, a web-based IT and asset management software.  While the content is submitted as a CVE request it does not contain the assigned CVE ID. The first vulnerability is an arbitrary file upload and the second is a privilege escalation.

**1/ Arbitrary file upload**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a combination of predictable uploaded file names (not randomized), allowing unauthorized file extensions to be uploaded, and temporary uploaded files not being deleted if an unauthorized file extension is used.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Predictable file names: Uploaded files are stored using their original names in a temporary directory, making it easy to guess the file path.
    *   Unrestricted file upload: The application does not properly validate the file extension before uploading.
    *   Failure to clean up temporary files: Temporary files are not deleted after processing or if they are unauthorized.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a PHP file, gaining full control of the webserver.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with an account that has the right to create tickets can upload a malicious file via the attachment feature in the ticket creation form.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs a valid user account with the permission to create a ticket.

**2/ Privilege escalation**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when creating new user accounts. Specifically the `_profiles_id` parameter which corresponds to the group attached to the user.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Insufficient input validation on the `_profiles_id` parameter during user creation.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the ability to create user accounts can create a new user with super-admin privileges.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the right to create new users can intercept the POST request during user creation and modify the `_profiles_id` to '4', which assigns super-admin privileges.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs a valid user account with the permission to create other user accounts.
