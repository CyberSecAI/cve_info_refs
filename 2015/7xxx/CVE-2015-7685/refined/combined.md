# [CVE-REQUEST] Multiple vulnerabilities on GLPI

---

*From*: Stiehl <pstiehl () lexsi com>

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in GLPI
(<http://www.glpi-project.org>).
```

1/ Arbitrary file upload
Severity: Important

Versions Affected
===========
All versions between 0.85 and 0.85.2

Description
=======

```
When an user wants to create a new ticket, he has the possibility to add
an attachment. If for example he wants to add a file named "test.php"
with or without adding the ticket, the file will be temporary uploaded
to GLPI\_ROOT/files/\_tmp/test.php. We can then directly access this file
through <http://host/GLPI_ROOT/files/_tmp/test.php> and by default the php
code will be interpreted.
```

```
To trigger this vulnerability we need an account that disposes of the
rights to create a ticket.
```

This vulnerability is a combination of three issues:
- predictable uploaded file names (not randomized)
- upload of unauthorized file extensions

```
- temporary uploaded files not deleted if using an unauthorized file
extension.
```

Impact
=====

```
By uploading a php file that will be interpreted a malicious user would
be able to execute arbitrary code on the server.
```

Mitigation
======
Upgrade to GLPI 0.85.3 (<https://forge.indepnet.net/issues/5217>)

==========

2/ Privilege escalation
Severity: Important

Versions Affected
===========
All versions <= 0.85.2

Description
=======

```
Taking the default account tech, he is only allowed to add users in the
following groups: Self-Service, Technician. He has not the right over,
for example, the super-admin group. So he cannot add the super-admin
privileges to an existing user.
```

```
The problem is when creating a new user. When intercepting the POST
request (GLPI\_ROOT/front/user.form.php) of a user creation and modifying
the \_profiles\_id parameter (corresponding to the group attached to the
user) to 4, the new user will have the super-admin privileges.
```

Impact
=====

```
Any user who has the rights to create a new user can create a
super-admin user.
```

Mitigation
======
Upgrade to GLPI 0.85.3 (<https://forge.indepnet.net/issues/5218>)
