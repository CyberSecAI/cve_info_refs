Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2015-7713 vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
The content explicitly mentions CVE-2015-7713 and describes a security vulnerability related to OpenStack Nova, which matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Nova's `object_compat` decorator handles database queries when refreshing instance security group rules. Specifically:
   - When a security group rule is added or removed, Nova attempts to refresh the rules on running instances.
   - The `refresh_instance_security_rules()` function, uses the `@object_compat` decorator.
   - This decorator attempts to load instance data from the database using `_load_instance()`.
   - The database query used to fetch the instance does not include the `metadata` and `system_metadata` attributes.
   - The `_load_instance` function tries to access the missing `metadata` and `system_metadata` attributes, resulting in a `KeyError`, which prevents security rule updates from being applied to the instances.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Inconsistent Data Retrieval:** The `trigger_rules_refresh()` method in the API layer retrieves the instance data with a query that doesn't include the metadata fields, while the `object_compat` decorator in the manager layer expects these attributes to be present in the data, which causes an error in the manager and prevents the application of security group rules.
   - **Incorrect Assumption:** The `object_compat` decorator makes the incorrect assumption that all instances will always have the 'metadata' and 'system_metadata' attributes, causing a `KeyError` when this assumption is not met.
    - **Lack of Error Reporting:** The security group API uses a cast, so the failure to refresh security group rules isn't reported to the user. This could provide a false sense of security.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Security Group Rules Not Applied:** Modifications to security group rules (adding or removing) are not immediately reflected in running instances.
   - **Potential for Unauthorized Access:**  Instances might not be protected by the updated security group rules, potentially leading to unauthorized access or exposure to malicious traffic.
   - **False Sense of Security:** Administrators might assume that changes to security groups are effective immediately, creating a false sense of security and a potential vulnerability window.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Security Group Modification:** An attacker with the ability to modify security groups can make changes and expect the rules to be applied. However, due to this vulnerability, the changes won't apply to already running instances. This may allow an attacker to bypass implemented protections.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **OpenStack User Access:** The attacker needs to have sufficient user privileges within OpenStack to modify security group rules.
   - **Awareness of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that security group rules might not apply immediately to running instances, and that re-association of a security group is needed to remediate it.

**Additional Details:**

   - This issue affects OpenStack Nova when using `nova-network` and not `neutron`, as `neutron` does not utilize the same mechanism to refresh the security rules.
   - The vulnerability was present in OpenStack versions up to 2014.2.3 and from 2015.1.0 up to 2015.1.1.
   - The fix involves updating the `object_compat` decorator to avoid errors when the metadata attributes are missing. The fix ensures that the refresh operation completes successfully and applies the new security rules.
   - The issue was also described as being a duplicate of [bug 1484738](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1484738).

In summary, CVE-2015-7713 describes a vulnerability in OpenStack Nova (nova-network) where changes to security group rules fail to be applied to running instances due to a `KeyError` in the `object_compat` decorator, leading to a potential security risk.
