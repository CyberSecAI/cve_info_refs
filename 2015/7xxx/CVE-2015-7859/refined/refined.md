- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate ACL (Access Control List) checks in the `com_contenthistory` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** ACL violation, potential read access to data that should be restricted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to data that should be access-restricted.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation through the `com_contenthistory` component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to interact with the vulnerable component, however, specific user level is not specified.
