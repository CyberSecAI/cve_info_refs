Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) are assigned to subdirectories and executable modules of several SafeNet Authentication Service Agents during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The ACLs allow authenticated users, including low-privileged users and guests, to have full control over the agent's file structure. This means they can modify, write, and even substitute executable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged attacker can modify or replace executable modules that are normally executed by higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators). When an administrator executes these tampered modules, the attacker gains full access to the compromised host with administrator privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation leads to an attacker gaining complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable agent is installed.
*   **File System Manipulation:**  The attacker must be able to modify files within the agent's installation directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, even a low-privileged or guest user is sufficient.
*   The attacker does not need specific administrative privileges to initially exploit the vulnerability, but needs to be able to modify files within the agent's installation directory.

**CVE IDs:**

*   CVE-2015-7596, CVE-2015-7597, CVE-2015-7598, CVE-2015-7961, CVE-2015-7962, CVE-2015-7963, CVE-2015-7964, CVE-2015-7965, CVE-2015-7966, CVE-2015-7967

**Affected Products:**
*   SafeNet Authentication Service Windows Logon Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service IIS Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service TokenValidator Proxy Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for Outlook Web App Agent
*    SafeNet Authentication Service for AD FS Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for NPS Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service Remote Web Workplace Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for Citrix Web Interface Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service End User Software Tools for Windows

**Mitigation:**

*   **Maintenance Releases:** Most of the affected agents have maintenance releases that fix the vulnerability.
*   **Manual Mitigation:** For agents without a patch, the following manual steps can be performed:
    1.  Go to the agent's local installation folder.
    2.  Right-click on the installation folder -> Properties -> Security.
    3.  Click the Edit button and set the following:
        *   For Authenticated Users: remove Full control/Modify/Write permissions. Allow Read & Execute only.
        *   Add the Administrators group and allow full permissions.
    4.  Click the Advanced button and verify that all child objects inherit the new permissions.
