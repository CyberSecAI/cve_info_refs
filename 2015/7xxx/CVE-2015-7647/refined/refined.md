  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player's handling of IExternalizable.readExternal. If readExternal is overridden with a non-function value, Flash Player incorrectly assumes it's a function, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Incorrect function pointer handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution by a remote attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted SWF file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to deliver the malicious SWF file to a user's browser"
