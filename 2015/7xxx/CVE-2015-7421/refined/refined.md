Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the duplication of the internal ICC PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) pool state during a `fork()` system call operation in GSKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The PRNG state is duplicated during the `fork()` system call. This results in child processes potentially generating identical PRNG output as the parent process for a period of time.
- This predictable PRNG output can be exploited by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information by exploiting the predictable PRNG output. The specific sensitive information is not detailed in this document, but it would relate to security mechanisms utilizing the vulnerable PRNG.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is high (AC:H), indicating that exploiting this is not straightforward.
- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The scope is unchanged (S:U) which implies the vulnerability is contained to the vulnerable component.
- The impact is limited to confidentiality (C:L), meaning there is potential for data disclosure.
- There is no impact to integrity or availability (I:N, A:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be remote, requiring network access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs the technical capability to exploit the predictability of the PRNG output. This likely involves understanding how the PRNG is used within the application and how to leverage the duplication vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- IBM MQ Appliance M2000
- AIX 5.3, 6.1, 7.1, 7.2
- VIOS 2.2.x
- Tivoli Directory Server and IBM Security Directory Server for AIX/VIOS

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in GSKit 8. GSKit 7 is not affected.
- The provided CVSS vector is `(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)`.
- The vulnerability is related to the use of `fork()` system calls, which is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems.
- Fixes are available and should be installed.
