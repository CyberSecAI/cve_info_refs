{
  "CVE-2015-7849": {
    "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the password management functionality of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption",
	  "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted key file can cause a buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption. This can potentially lead to a crash or code injection.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can provide a malicious password file to trigger the vulnerability. This could be done remotely if ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration and the attacker either knows the password, or if authentication has been disabled.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to either have access to the password, or authentication needs to be disabled. They also need to have a spoofed IP address that is permitted to send configuration requests to ntpd."
