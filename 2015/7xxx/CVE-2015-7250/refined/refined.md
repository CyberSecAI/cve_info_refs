Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `webproc` CGI module of the ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router improperly handles the `getpage` parameter. It accepts an unrestricted file path as input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths through the `getpage` parameter of the `webproc` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the device's file system. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or other system data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint. The malicious file path is passed within the `getpage` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. This means an unauthenticated attacker on the same network (LAN) can exploit the vulnerability. In some configurations, it may be reachable by external attackers.
