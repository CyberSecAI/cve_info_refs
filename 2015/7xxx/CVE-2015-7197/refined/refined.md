Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7197:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a mechanism that allows a web worker to bypass secure requirements when establishing WebSockets. Specifically, the `GetEntryGlobal()` function in `WebSocket.cpp` could return null in certain conditions when used by a worker, which leads to a bypass of mixed content WebSocket policy.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mixed Content WebSocket Policy Bypass:** A web worker can create a WebSocket object bypassing the secure connection requirement, and allow for an insecure connection.
* The issue stems from improper handling of the origin when creating WebSockets from within a worker. 

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass mixed content WebSocket policy.
*   The impact is described as "moderate" by Red Hat and "critical" by SUSE.
*   Theoretically, this could allow an attacker to intercept sensitive information transmitted over WebSockets.
*   In the context of Thunderbird, the primary risk is in browser-like contexts as scripting is disabled by default for email messages. In browser contexts, the vulnerability may lead to cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web pages with malicious content:** An attacker can host a webpage containing specially crafted JavaScript to exploit this vulnerability through web workers.
*   **Browser/browser-like context:** This vulnerability is primarily exploitable in a browser environment, either directly in the Firefox browser or in a similar context such as Thunderbird's rendering of RSS feed content.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious webpage.
*   The attacker needs to be able to embed the malicious JavaScript code in the web page.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability arises due to an issue in how the origin of the WebSocket connection is determined when initiated from within a web worker.
*   Specifically, the `GetEntryGlobal()` function in `WebSocket.cpp` was returning null under certain conditions related to workers.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves utilizing the worker's private data to determine the correct origin for WebSocket connections.
*   Red Hat and SUSE addressed this issue with updated packages for their respective Linux distributions.

**Affected products (as per provided content):**
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5, 6, and 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 5, 6, and 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop 5, 6, and 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM z Systems 6 and 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power, big endian 5, 6 and 7
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 LTSS
*   openSUSE Leap 42.1
*   Firefox and Thunderbird (multiple versions)
*   Several versions of Firefox ESR.

The provided content indicates that this vulnerability can allow for an attacker to bypass the secure websocket requirements via workers, and potentially lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of user's system.
