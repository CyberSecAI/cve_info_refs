- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server interface allows the authentication process to be bypassed due to improper path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Path Traversal (CWE-22): Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory allows bypassing the authentication process.
    - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): User passwords are not encrypted during transmission.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Path Traversal: Remote attacker can gain unauthenticated access, potentially allowing unauthorized configuration changes, initiation of calibration or test processes.
    - Cleartext Transmission: User credentials can be intercepted during transmission.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with low skill can exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker requires network access to the device.
