  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2015-7672",
      "details": "The provided document indicates that Centreon Web version 2.8.27 includes a fix for an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability when using the command's testing feature. It also includes fixes for multiple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities in areas such as hosts and services comments, poller resources, ACL group search field, media, and hostname resolver and multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting Administration Logs page, virtual metrics, and host list page.",
       "Root cause": "The root cause of the RCE vulnerability is not specified, but it involves the command testing feature. The other vulnerabilities are due to improper input sanitization or lack of it, leading to XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities",
        "SQL injection vulnerabilities"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE), inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users (XSS) or gain unauthorized access to or modify sensitive data in the database (SQL injection).",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The RCE attack vector is related to the command testing feature.",
         "XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious code into input fields like host/service comments, ACL group search, media fields and hostname resolver.",
        "SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious input through web interfaces that are then used to build SQL queries."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to access the Centreon web interface and interact with the vulnerable components (command testing feature, comment input, ACL fields, media and hostname resolver). Specific privileges may be needed depending on the exploit location and type."
