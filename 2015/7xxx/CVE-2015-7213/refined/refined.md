  "CVE-2015-7213": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the MPEG4Extractor::readMetaData function in MPEG4Extractor.cpp in libstagefright in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.5 on 64-bit platforms allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted MP4 video file that triggers a buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `psshsize` calculation within `MPEG4Extractor::readMetaData` function of libstagefright, leading to an undersized buffer allocation and subsequent buffer overflow when copying data into this undersized buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Buffer overflow",
         "Use of attacker-controlled data in calculations"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service due to a memory-safety bug caused by a buffer overflow.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted MP4 video file served by web content.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to a vulnerable application."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox (versions before 43.0)",
      "Mozilla Firefox ESR (versions before 38.5)",
       "Thunderbird (versions before 38.5)"
    ],
        "additional_notes": [
      "The issue only affects 64-bit versions of Firefox due to the size of the allocated memory. Although the bug was found via code inspection, a Proof of Concept (POC) was crafted that showed the exploit was possible.",
      "The vulnerability was found in libstagefright, a Google library used by Firefox for media playback.",
          "The vulnerability is exploitable because data causing the overrun comes directly from the MP4 file and is under an attacker's control"
    ]
