# JVN#34780384 Kirby vulnerable to arbitrary file creation

## Overview

Kirby contains a vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary files.

## Products Affected

* Kirby 2.1.1 and earlier

## Description

Kirby is a content management system (CMS). Kirby contains a vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to create arbitrary files.

## Impact

An arbitrary file created by a logged in attacker may result in arbitrary PHP code being executed on the server.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

## Vendor Status

| Vendor | Link |
| --- | --- |
| Bastian Allgeier GmbH | [Security Update - Kirby 2.1.2](http://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-1-2) |

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface). |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:6.5
