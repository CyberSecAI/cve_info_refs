Avoid passsing possible user input directly into the shell. Instead
quote the `image_path` value before calling the `convert` command.

# CVE-2015-7541 (colorscore): colorscore Gem for Ruby lib/colorscore/histogram.rb Arbitrary Command Injection

January 4th, 2016

### ADVISORIES

* [CVE-2015-7541](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7541)
  ([NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-7541))
* [GHSA-73qw-ww62-m54x](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73qw-ww62-m54x)
* OSVDB-132516
* [Vendor Advisory](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/17)

### GEM

[colorscore](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorscore)

### SEVERITY

[CVSS v3.x](https://www.first.org/cvss/): 10.0 (**Critical**)

### PATCHED VERSIONS

* `>= 0.0.5`

### DESCRIPTION

The contents of the `image_path`, `colors`, and `depth` variables generated
from possibly user-supplied input are passed directly to the shell via
`convert ...`.

If a user supplies a value that includes shell metacharacters such as ';', an
attacker may be able to execute shell commands on the remote system as the
user id of the Ruby process.

To resolve this issue, the aforementioned variables (especially `image_path`)
must be sanitized for shell metacharacters.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Subject: Remote Command Injection in Ruby Gem colorscore <=0.0.4

Title: Remote Command Injection in Ruby Gem colorscore <=0.0.4

Description: Finds the dominant colors in an image and scores them against
a user-defined palette, using the CIE2000 Delta E formula.

Homepage: <https://github.com/quadule/colorscore>

Download: <https://rubygems.org/gems/colorscore>

Affected versions: All (<=0.0.4 currently)

Vulnerability:
The contents of the `image_path`, `colors`, and `depth` variables generated
from possibly user-supplied input are passed directly to the shell on line
4. If a user supplies a value that includes shell metacharacters such as
';', an attacker may be able to execute shell commands on the remote system
as the user id of the Ruby process.

To resolve this issue, the aforementioned variables (especially
`image_path`) must be sanitized for shell metacharacters.

1  module Colorscore
2    class Histogram
3      def initialize(image_path, colors=16, depth=8)
4        output = `convert #{image_path} -resize 400x400 -format %c -dither
None -quantize YIQ -colors #{colors} -depth #{depth} histogram:info:-`
5        @lines = output.lines.sort.reverse.map(&:strip).reject(&:empty?)
6      end
