**Content Relevance:**

The provided content is a commit log from a git repository, specifically for the "admin_views" project. The commit message "Always use display configured path in access handler" and the associated code changes are likely related to a bug fix or security enhancement. However, without a full code diff or a description of the vulnerability being addressed, it's difficult to correlate it definitively to **CVE-2015-7226**. Therefore, a thorough analysis is not possible and may be unrelated to the CVE, because the CVE description is a PLACEHOLDER.

**Summary:**

Given the lack of concrete information connecting the commit to the CVE, this commit log alone isn't enough to give a meaningful analysis of the mentioned CVE.
