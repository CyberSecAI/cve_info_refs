Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7967

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) on installation subdirectories and executable modules of SafeNet Authentication Service Agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Inadequate file system permissions, granting excessive control to authenticated users.
*   Authenticated users have full control over the agent's file structure, including write/modify/full control permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can modify or substitute executable modules.
*   When a high-privileged user executes a modified module, the attacker gains the same privileges.
*   This can lead to complete system compromise and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access. An attacker needs to be able to log into the system.
*   Exploitation involves modifying or replacing executable files within the vulnerable application's directories.
*   The attacker does not need any special privilges at the start of the attack, only a valid user account on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
*   The attacker must be able to access the file system where the vulnerable application is installed.
*   The attacker needs to modify an executable that will be later run by a user with higher privileges (ex: an Administrator).

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in multiple SafeNet Authentication Service Agents, including  "SafeNet Authentication Service for Citrix Web Interface Agent" (CVE-2015-7967).
*   A PDF detailing the vulnerability has been released by the vendor.
*   The vendor has also published its own advisory, available on the Gemalto support site.
*   The vendor has provided maintenance releases for some agents and instructions for manual mitigation for the others.
*   Manual mitigation involves modifying the permissions of the installation folder by removing write/modify/full control permissions from authenticated users, leaving only read and execute, and adding full permissions to administrators.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system via privilege escalation by leveraging weak file permissions.
