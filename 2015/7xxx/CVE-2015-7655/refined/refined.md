    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.261 and 19.x before 19.0.0.245 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.548 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.241, Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.241, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 19.0.0.241 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted actionExtends arguments, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-7651, CVE-2015-7652, CVE-2015-7653, CVE-2015-7654, CVE-2015-7656, CVE-2015-7657, CVE-2015-7658, CVE-2015-7660, CVE-2015-7661, CVE-2015-7663, CVE-2015-8042, CVE-2015-8043, CVE-2015-8044, and CVE-2015-8046.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `actionExtends` method of Adobe Flash Player.",
      "weaknesses": "The vulnerability occurs because a dangling pointer can be reused after being freed. This results in a use-after-free condition.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, leading to potential system compromise.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered when a victim loads a page containing malicious SWF content, or opens a malicious SWF file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers can craft a malicious SWF file with specific `actionExtends` arguments that cause the use-after-free condition."
