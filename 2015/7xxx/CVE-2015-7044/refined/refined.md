- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A privilege issue existed in handling union mounts within the System Integrity Protection (SIP) mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Insufficient privilege separation in the handling of union mounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application with root privileges may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This means an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local malicious application with root privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious application that has already obtained root privileges on the system.
