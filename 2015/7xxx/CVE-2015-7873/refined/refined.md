Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7873:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in phpMyAdmin's redirection mechanism to external sites. Specifically, the application was not properly sanitizing the URL parameter used in redirection, allowing an attacker to control the content displayed during the redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Content Spoofing:** The primary weakness is the ability to display attacker-controlled content via the redirection mechanism.
* **Improper Sanitization:** The application did not sufficiently sanitize or escape the URL parameter before displaying it to the user in a redirect message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Deceptive Redirects:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when used in phpMyAdmin's redirection, displays a deceptive message to the user before being redirected to the target site.
* **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Although no HTML injection is possible because the content is escaped, this vulnerability could still be used to trick users into believing they are interacting with a legitimate service. It could be used in conjunction with other attacks, including phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `url` parameter in the request to phpMyAdmin's redirection script (`url.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that is then used by a phpMyAdmin user. This could be done by embedding the URL in an email, forum post, etc..
* No direct access to the phpMyAdmin server is required.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is considered non-critical because the displayed content is escaped preventing HTML injection.
* Affected versions include phpMyAdmin 4.4.x (prior to 4.4.15.1) and 4.5.x (prior to 4.5.1).
* The fix involves changing `printf(__('Taking you to %s.'), htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['url']));` to `echo __('Taking you to the target site.');` in `url.php` to avoid printing user controlled input.
