| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:42:32 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the ntpd process.  Upstream patch (which also addresses [CVE-2015-7978](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7978)):  <https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/8a0c765f3c47633fa262356b0818788d1cf249b1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:51:01 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit> <http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0074/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 12:01:57 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1300277](show_bug.cgi?id=1300277 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-7974 CVE-2015-8138 CVE-2015-7973 CVE-2015-7975 CVE-2015-7976 CVE-2015-7977 CVE-2015-7978 CVE-2015-7979 CVE-2015-8158 CVE-2015-8139 CVE-2015-8140 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-21 14:09:20 UTC  ``` To exploit this issue, the attacker has to rely on two factors:  * ntpd to be configured to receive mode 7 packets. By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ntpd is configured to receive this packets only on localhost.  * the restriction list must contain a large number of entries (more than 500).  When the number of entries is large enough, the NULL pointer dereference is triggered and causes ntpd to crash.  Since the attacker has no way of influencing the size of the restriction list by adding more entries, it is quite unlikely to exploit this issue.  Having such a large number of restriction entries would also be an uncommon configuration since it would be more practical to restrict connecting clients via other means (e.g. iptables) should the system require it.  Statement:  This issue affects the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-21 14:10:41 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Keep the number of restriction list entries in ntp.conf lower than 500.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1300269#c6)  Fedora Update System    2016-01-30 18:21:16 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-36.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

CVE Name: CVE-2015-7973, CVE-2015-7974, CVE-2015-7975, CVE-2015-7976,
CVE-2015-7977, CVE-2015-7978, CVE-2015-7979, CVE-2015-8138,
CVE-2015-8139, CVE-2015-8140, CVE-2015-8158
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ntp 4.2.8p5:
Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq. [CVE-2015-8158]
A logic error would allow packets with an origin timestamp of zero
to bypass this check whenever there is not an outstanding request
to the server. [CVE-2015-8138]
Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast mode.
[CVE-2015-7979]
Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction list. [CVE-2015-7978]
reslist NULL pointer dereference. [CVE-2015-7977]
ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in filenames.
[CVE-2015-7976]
nextvar() missing length check. [CVE-2015-7975]
Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation between authenticated
peers. [CVE-2015-7974]
Deja Vu: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode. [CVE-2015-7973]
ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks. [CVE-2015-8140]
Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin. [CVE-2015-8139]
III. Impact
A malicious NTP server, or an attacker who can conduct MITM attack by
intercepting NTP query traffic, may be able to cause a ntpq client to
infinitely loop. [CVE-2015-8158]
A malicious NTP server, or an attacker who can conduct MITM attack by
intercepting NTP query traffic, may be able to prevent a ntpd(8) daemon
to distinguish between legitimate peer responses from forgeries. This
can partially be mitigated by configuring multiple time sources.
[CVE-2015-8138]
An off-path attacker who can send broadcast packets with bad
authentication (wrong key, mismatched key, incorrect MAC, etc) to
broadcast clients can cause these clients to tear down associations.
[CVE-2015-7979]
An attacker who can send unauthenticated 'reslist' command to a NTP
server may cause it to crash, resulting in a denial of service
condition due to stack exhaustion [CVE-2015-7978] or a NULL pointer
dereference [CVE-2015-7977].
An attacker who can send 'modify' requests to a NTP server may be
able to create file that contain dangerous characters in their name,
which could cause dangerous behavior in a later shell invocation.
[CVE-2015-7976]
A remote attacker may be able to crash a ntpq client. [CVE-2015-7975]
A malicious server which holds a trusted key may be able to
impersonate other trusted servers in an authenticated configuration.
[CVE-2015-7974]
A man-in-the-middle attacker or a malicious participant that has the
same trusted keys as the victim can replay time packets if the NTP
network is configured for broadcast operations. [CVE-2015-7973]
The ntpq protocol is vulnerable to replay attacks which may be used
to e.g. re-establish an association to malicious server. [CVE-2015-8140]
An attacker who can intercept NTP traffic can easily forge live server
responses. [CVE-2015-8139]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:09/ntp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:09/ntp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time. (CVE-2015-7979)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-5196, CVE-2015-7703)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A). (CVE-2015-7974)
* A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client processed certain incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. (CVE-2015-8158)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).

* TIM 4R-IE DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [INCORRECT TYPE CONVERSION OR CAST CWE-704](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/704.html)

The ULOGTOD function in ntp.d in SNTP before 4.2.7p366 does not properly perform type conversions from a precision value to a double, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted NTP packet.

[CVE-2015-5219](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5219) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

The decodenetnum function in ntpd in NTP 4.2.x before 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.x before 4.3.77 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure) via a 6 or mode 7 packet containing a long data value.

[CVE-2015-7855](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7855) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)

Crypto-NAK packets in ntpd in NTP 4.2.x before 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.x before 4.3.77 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication.

[CVE-2015-7871](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7871) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [SECURITY FEATURES CWE-254](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/254.html)

NTP before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90, when configured in broadcast mode, allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct replay attacks by sniffing the network.

[CVE-2015-7973](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7973) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.13    [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)

ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ephemeralassociation demobilization) by sending a spoofed crypto-NAK packet with incorrect authentication data at a certain time.

[CVE-2016-4953](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4953) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.14    [CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION')CWE-362](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)

The process\_packet function in ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peer-variable modification) by sending spoofed packets from many source IP addresses in a certain scenario, as demonstrated by triggering an incorrect leap indication.

[CVE-2016-4954](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4954) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to the Port UDP/123 of an affected device.
* Migrate to a successor product.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-497656](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-497656.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

SSA-497656: Multiple NTP Vulnerabilities in TIM 4R-IE Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2021-04-13
2021-04-13
V1.0

SUMMARY

There are multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying NTP component of the affected TIM 4R-IE.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

TIM 4R-IE (incl. SIPLUS NET variants):
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

TIM 4R-IE DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants):
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time syncronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default.

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to the port udp/123 of an affected device.

• Migrate to a successor product.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The TIM 4R-IE is a SINAUT ST7 communications module for the SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface
for SINAUT communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for SINAUT communication via an
IP-based network (WAN or LAN).

The TIM 4R-IE DNP3 communication module for SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface for DNP3
communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for DNP3 communication via a IP-based network
(WAN or LAN).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-5219

The ULOGTOD function in ntp.d in SNTP before 4.2.7p366 does not properly perform type conversions
from a precision value to a double, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (inﬁnite
loop) via a crafted NTP packet.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1547

An off-path attacker can cause a preemptible client association to be demobilized in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 by sending a crypto NAK packet
to a victim client with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer. This is true even if
authentication is enabled.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1548

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the
peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate
server responses.
It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been
changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1550

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the message authentication functionality of libntp in ntp 4.2.8p4
and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92. An attacker can send a series of crafted
messages to attempt to recover the message digest key.

Actor

Vulnerability CVE-2016-4953

ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ephemeral-
association demobilization) by sending a spoofed crypto-NAK packet with incorrect authentication
data at a certain time.

The process_packet function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (peer-variable modiﬁcation) by sending spoofed packets from many source
IP addresses in a certain scenario, as demonstrated by triggering an incorrect leap indication.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0071

## Network Time Protocol Skeleton Key: Symmetric Authentication Impersonation Vulnerability

##### January 19, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2015-7974, CVE-2016-1567

CERT VU#357792

### Summary

Symmetric key encryption requires a single trusted key to be specified for
each server configuration. A key specified only for one server should only work
to authenticate that server, other trusted keys should be refused.

Instead we observe that when symmetric key authentication is verified, there is
no check that the key used is the key specified for the address, any trusted key
can be used as long as the keyid references another key the systems share and
that key is used to compute the MAC.

This has three implications for the client server model. A client that has multiple
servers configured each with different keys could be attacked by one of its servers
spoofing every other server using its own key. Even worse a server can be attacked
by any of its authenticated clients in a similar manner.

Finally, being able to use any key to authenticate a packet for a client or server
means that if any key in the trustedkeys list uses a weak digest algorithim (MD5),
then an attacker can abuse that method instead of being restricted by the stronger
keys configured.

NOTE: Code locations referenced below refer to the NTP reference
implementation from http://www.ntp.org.

There is no clear location in the code where this defect occurs, since it exists
due to an omission. Verifying the key used matches the proper server’s key could be
done in ntp\_proto.c around line 803 (in 4.8.2p3) where authdecrypt is called, or
it might make sense to build it into the libntp code such as the authdecrypt
function itself.

Be aware that this issue could affect other ntpd modes of operation such as
broadcast or active/passive peering.

### Details

ntpd does not ensure that the key used to verify the authenticity of a
packet actually belongs to the alleged sender of the packet.

The intended binding between keys (via keyids) and peers is indicated
to ntpd through the configuration file. For example:

```
server ntp-server key 1

```

indicates that keyid 1 is a symmetric key shared with ntp-server.
Packets bound for ntp-server should be authenticated under keyid 1
and, to prevent impersonation, packets from ntp-server should be
authenticated using keyid 1.

Unfortunately, when receiving a packet, allegedly from ntp-sever, ntpd
does not require the packet to authenticate under keyid 1. ntpd only
ensures that the packet authenticates under *some* trustedkey known to
ntpd. This allows any authenticated peer to impersonate any other
authenticated peer.

We confirmed this vulnerability with the following setup. (The tests
below were performed with NTP 4.2.8p3. 4.2.8p4 appears to introduce
regressions which break LOCAL refclocks and symmetric associations.)

* ntp-server - simulated stratum 1 server to provide time to clients

  ```
    # /etc/ntp.conf
    keys /etc/ntp.keys
    trustedkey 1
    server 127.127.1.1 prefer
    fudge 127.127.1.1 stratum 0

    # /etc/ntp.keys:
    1 MD5 youllneverguess
    2 MD5 you_really_wont

  ```
* ntp-client - authenticates ntp-server with keyid 1 and ntp-client2
  with keyid 2

  ```
    # /etc/ntp.conf
    keys /etc/ntp.keys
    trustedkey 1 2
    server ntp-server key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2 iburst
    peer ntp-client2 key 2 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2 noselect

    # /etc/ntp.keys
    1 MD5 youllneverguess
    2 MD5 you_really_wont

  ```
* ntp-client2 - authenticates ntp-server with keyid 1, uses keyid 1 to
  talk to ntp-client

  ```
    # /etc/ntp.conf
    keys /etc/ntp.keys
    trustedkey 1 2
    server ntp-server key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2 iburst
    peer ntp-client key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2

    # /etc/ntp.keys
    1 MD5 youllneverguess
    2 MD5 you_really_wont

  ```
* attacker1 (192.168.33.9) - conducts a man-in-the-middle attack using
  ntp-client2’s peer key (keyid 2) to impersonate ntp-server to
  ntp-client and shift time

  attacker1 uses an ARP-spoofing attack to intercept and replay all
  packets between ntp-client and ntp-server. When it receives a
  server mode packet, it modifies the sent and recv time to be 100
  years in the future. It then authenticates the packet with
  ntp-client2’s key (keyid 2). In this specific attack, the
  timestamps overflow so 100 years in the future from 2015 is 1979.

  ntp-client accepts the forged replies as though they were coming
  from ntp-server and, eventually, steps its clock.

### Do The Sender and Recipient Have to Agree on the Keyid?

According to the ntpd documentation `html/authentic.html`:

> The servers and clients involved must agree on the key ID, key type
> and key to authenticate NTP packets.

Though it doesn’t indicate precisely what “agreement” means or why,
this conflicts with RFC 5905 which states:

> keyid: Symmetric key ID for the 128-bit MD5 key used to generate and
> verify the MAC. The client and server or peer can use different
> values, but they must map to the same key.

This statement is problematic and only partially true. It is
problematic because it does not address the binding of symmetric keys
(specified by keyid) to the peers that they authenticate, allowing for
impersonation between peers. It is only partially true because, in
client-server modes, the server will use the keyid from the client
mode packet to authenticate the incoming client mode packet as well as
the outgoing server mode packet. Thus, in a benign scenario, clients
and server must agree both on keyid and the key value. In symmetric
modes, the statement is partially true because each peer uses the
keyid specified in its peer association when generating an outgoing
packet. However, in all cases, the keyid specified in an incoming
packet will be used to authenticate that packet. Therefore, even in
symmetric modes, if the two peers use different keyids A and B for a
given symmetric association, each peer must map *both* keyids to the
same key — the sender will use A (respectively B) to generate the
authenticator for the outgoing packet and, therefore, the recipient
will use A (respectively B) to authenticate the incoming packet. This
is illustrated by the non-normative example code from RFC 5905:

* According to receive() (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-78)
  the keyid in the received packet is used to look up the key to
  authenticate the packet.
* The keyid in the received packet is used to set the peer keyid for
  manycast peers (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-78),
  symmetric peers (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-79), and
  broadcast peers.
* The keyid in the received packet is also used to choose the
  keyid and key to authenticate the transmitted packet in
  fast\_xmit() (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-88)
* In peer\_xmit() (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905#page-108)
  the keyid of the peer is used to authenticate the transmitted
  packet. It appears to omit setting the keyid on the transmitted
  packet. But, for preemptable associations, the peer keyid came
  from a received packet. For configured associations, it’s the
  value from the configuration file.

This is also borne out by the ntpd source code. When ntpd receives an
incoming packet with an authenticator, it verifies the authentication
under the key specified by the keyid from the incoming packet:

* receive() reads the keyid from the packet:

  ```
    skeyid = ntohl(((u_int32 *)pkt)[authlen / 4]);

  ```
* receive() then calls authdecrypt() with that keyid:

  ```
    if (!authdecrypt(skeyid, (u_int32 *)pkt, authlen,
        has_mac))
        is_authentic = AUTH_ERROR;
    else
        is_authentic = AUTH_OK;

  ```
* authdecrypt() calls authhavekey() which looks up the key by
  keyid:

  ```
    if (id == sk->keyid) {
        if (0 == sk->type) {

  ```
* And finally, MD5authdecrypt() is called to compute and verify the
  digest using the key value found via the packet’s key id
* But, there is never a check which verifies that the keyid from the
  incoming packet (skeyid) matches the keyid configured for the peer
  association in question (peer->keyid)

### Test Case: Equal keyids Refer to Differing Key Material

To verify that the sender and recipient can’t merely use different
keyids to refer to the same key material unless *both* have been
configured to map *both* keyids to the same key, we configured
ntp-client2 with the same keys as ntp-server and ntp-client, but we
swapped the keyids on ntp-client2. This confirmed that, though
ntp-client2 was using the same key material as the other two nodes, all
packets from ntp-client2 would fail authentication because the other
nodes did not also have the same key material mapped to the keyids
sent by ntp-client2.

* ntp-client can sync with ntp-server just fine

  ```
    # /etc/ntp.keys
    1 MD5 youllneverguess
    2 MD5 you_really_wont

    # /etc/ntp.conf
    keys /etc/ntp.keys
    trustedkey 1 2

    server ntp-server key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2 iburst
    peer ntp-client2  key 2 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2

    ntp-client$ ntpq -c as

    ind assid status  conf reach auth condition  last_event cnt
    ===========================================================
      1 43544  f65a   yes   yes   ok   sys.peer    sys_peer  5  # ntp-server
      2 43545  e01a   yes    no   ok     reject    sys_peer  1  # ntp-client2

  ```

  ntp-client detects that ntp-client2’s packets fail authentication.
  However, because ntp-client2 is also rejecting ntp-client’s
  packets due to bad auth, the origin timestamp doesn’t match and
  that check fails first before an auth check is performed. Note
  the `auth 2` (AUTH\_ERROR) on line 2 of the log snippet below.

  ```
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): calling authdecrypt
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: receive: at 698 192.168.33.11<-192.168.33.13 mode 1 keyid 00000001 len 68 auth 2
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): big switch
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): AM_PROCPKT, regular packet
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): done with big switch
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): flip is 0, not interleaved
    Nov  3 19:23:37 ntp-client ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): met bogus condition (p_org is not qual to peer->aorg), test2

  ```
* ntp-client2 uses the same keys but different ids.

  ```
    # /etc/ntp.keys
    2 MD5 youllneverguess
    1 MD5 you_really_wont

    # /etc/ntp.conf
    keys /etc/ntp.keys
    trustedkey 1 2

    server ntp-server key 2 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2 iburst
    peer ntp-client   key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2

  ```

  We can see that ntp-client2 is rejecting both the server and the peer
  due to bad auth.

  ```
    ntp-client2$ ntpq -c as

    ind assid status  conf reach auth condition  last_event cnt
    ===========================================================
      1 64340  c01c   yes    no   bad    reject              1  # ntp-server
      2 64341  c01c   yes    no   bad    reject              1  # ntp-client

  ```

  We can see this when ntp-client2 receives a packet from ntp-client:

  ```
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: receive: at 1438 192.168.33.13<-192.168.33.11 mode 1 keyid 00000002 len 68 auth 2
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): big switch
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): AM_PROCPKT, regular packet
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): done with big switch
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): flip is 0, not interleaved
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: (ntp_proto.c): digest failed
    Nov  3 19:40:29 ntp-client2 ntpd: event at 1438 192.168.33.11 c01c 8c bad_auth digest

  ```

### Test Case: Using Different keyids That Map To The Same Key Material

This tests confirms that, as long as the sender and the recipient have
the same key material configured for a given keyid, the recipient
won’t enforce the binding between the keyid configured for an
association and the keyid used to authenticate an incoming packet
under that association.

We configure the same keys on both hosts

```
# /etc/ntp.keys on both hosts
1 MD5 youllneverguess
2 MD5 you_really_wont

```

But ntp-client uses keyid 2 to communicate with ntp-client2.

```
# ntp-client /etc/ntp.conf
keys /etc/ntp.keys
trustedkey 1 2

server ntp-server iburst key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2
peer ntp-client2 key 2

```

And ntp-client2 uses keyid 1 when sending packets to ntp-client.

```
# ntp-client2 /etc/ntp.conf
keys /etc/ntp.keys
trustedkey 1 2

server ntp-server iburst key 1 minpoll 2 maxpoll 2
peer ntp-client key 1

```

As can be seen here, both ntp-client and ntp-client2 accept the
packets from their peer despite being configured to use different
keyids.

```
ntp-client$ ntpq -c as
ind assid status  conf reach auth condition  last_event cnt
===========================================================
  1 55125  f65a   yes   yes   ok   sys.peer    sys_peer  5  # ntp-server
  2 55126  f03a   yes   yes   ok     reject    sys_peer  3  # ntp-client2

ntp-client2$ ntpq -c as
ind assid status  conf reach auth condition  last_event cnt
===========================================================
  1 53439  f63a   yes   yes   ok   sys.peer    sys_peer  3  # ntp-server
  2 53440  f024   yes   yes   ok     reject   reachable  2  # ntp-client

```
### Possible Fix

The following (untested) patch ensures that the keyid used to
authenticate the packet is the same as the keyid configured for the
corresponding peer association. If not, it sets `is_authentic` to
`AUTH_ERROR` and skips the call to `authdecrypt()`.

```

#### Description

Symmetric key encryption uses a shared trusted key. The reported title for this issue was “Missing key check allows impersonation between authenticated peers” and the report claimed “A key specified only for one server should only work to authenticate that server, other trusted keys should be refused.” Except there has never been any correlation between this trusted key and server v. clients machines and there has never been any way to specify a key only for one server. We have treated this as an enhancement request, and ntp-4.2.8p6 includes other checks and tests to strengthen clients against attacks coming from broadcast servers.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* If this scenario represents a real or a potential issue for you, upgrade to [4.2.8p6 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/), and use the new field in the `ntp.keys` file that specifies the list of IPs that are allowed to serve time. Note that this alone will not protect against time packets with forged source IP addresses, however other changes in ntp-4.2.8p6 provide significant mitigation against broadcast attacks. MITM attacks are a different story.
* If you are unable to upgrade:
  + Don’t use broadcast mode if you cannot monitor your client servers.
  + If you choose to use symmetric keys to authenticate time packets in a hostile environment where ephemeral time servers can be created, or if it is expected that malicious time servers will participate in an NTP broadcast domain, limit the number of participating systems that participate in the shared-key group.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-7974

    Matt Street discovered that insufficient key validation allows
    impersonation attacks between authenticated peers.

CVE-2015-7977 / CVE-2015-7978

    Stephen Gray discovered that a NULL pointer dereference and a
    buffer overflow in the handling of "ntpdc reslist" commands may
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2015-7979

    Aanchal Malhotra discovered that if NTP is configured for broadcast
    mode, an attacker can send malformed authentication packets which
    break associations with the server for other broadcast clients.

CVE-2015-8138

    Matthew van Gundy and Jonathan Gardner discovered that missing
    validation of origin timestamps in ntpd clients may result in denial
    of service.

CVE-2015-8158

    Jonathan Gardner discovered that missing input sanitising in ntpq
    may result in denial of service.

CVE-2016-1547

    Stephen Gray and Matthew van Gundy discovered that incorrect handling
    of crypto NAK packets my result in denial of service.

CVE-2016-1548

    Jonathan Gardner and Miroslav Lichvar discovered that ntpd clients
    could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved
    symmetric mode, preventing time synchronisation.

CVE-2016-1550

    Matthew van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered
    that timing leaks in the the packet authentication code could result
    in recovery of a message digest.

CVE-2016-2516

    Yihan Lian discovered that duplicate IPs on "unconfig" directives will
    trigger an assert.

CVE-2016-2518

    Yihan Lian discovered that an OOB memory access could potentially
    crash ntpd.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1297471#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-11 15:33:45 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in NTP:  Symmetric key encryption requires a single trusted key to be specified for each server configuration. A key specified only for one server should only work to authenticate that server, other trusted keys should be refused.  However, when symmetric key authentication is verified, there is no check that the key used is the key specified for the address, any trusted key can be used as long as the keyid references another key the systems share and that key is used to compute the MAC.  An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1297471#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 09:00:59 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/71a962710bfe066f76da9679cf4cfdeffe34e95e>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1297471#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:49:36 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2936> <http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0071/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1297471#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 12:01:30 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1300277](show_bug.cgi?id=1300277 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-7974 CVE-2015-8138 CVE-2015-7973 CVE-2015-7975 CVE-2015-7976 CVE-2015-7977 CVE-2015-7978 CVE-2015-7979 CVE-2015-8158 CVE-2015-8139 CVE-2015-8140 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1297471#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 14:32:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-11 01:24:06 UTC  ``` Symmetric key encryption requires a single trusted key to be specified for each server configuration. A key specified only for one server should only work to authenticate that server, other trusted keys should be refused.  Instead we observe that when symmetric key authentication is verified, there is no check that the key used is the key specified for the address, any trusted key can be used as long as the keyid references another key the systems share and that key is used to compute the MAC.  This has three implications for the client server model. A client that has multiple servers configured each with different keys could be attacked by one of its servers spoofing every other server using its own key. Even worse a server can be attacked by any of its authenticated clients in a similar manner.  Finally, being able to use any key to authenticate a packet for a client or server means that if any key in the trustedkeys list uses a  weak digest algorithim (MD5), then an attacker can abuse that method instead of being restricted by the stronger keys configured.  There is no clear location in the code where this defect occurs, since it exists due to an omission. Verifying the key used matches the proper server's key could be done in ntp_proto.c around line 803 (in 4.8.2p3) where authdecrypt is called, or it might make sense to build it into the libntp code such as the authdecrypt function itself.  Be aware that this issue could affect other ntpd modes of operation such as broadcast or active/passive peering.  This defect was discovered by Matt Street <mastreet@cisco.com> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-11 01:30:34 UTC  ``` The first and biggest problem I see with this report is that it assumes there is supposed to be a connection between a private key and a server.  No such connection exists with symmetric keys for NTP. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c2)  Danny Mayer    2015-10-13 01:35:07 UTC  ``` I think that there may be a problem here. Once an association has been authenticated then that packets between the two systems need to continue to use the key used for creating that association trust. What needs to happen is that when the trust is established a reference to the key used should be kept until the association is cleared. Otherwise, according to the report, any other valid key in the list can be used, probably by a rogue server that has a trusted key which can spoof the packets. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c3)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-10-28 05:52:14 UTC  ``` Danny and Harlan, you have both a point there.  'Hijacking' a key that is used for another peer is only possible if a key is already compromised.  Hijacking after authentication can be prevented by keeping the (auto-)key in the peer structure once a peer authenticated itself with it. Packets that need cryptographic authentication are validated against this key and ignored otherwise. (This must be of course 'forgotten' when the peer association drops.)  Alas, this does not prevent *establishing* a peer connection from a rogue peer under false identity. To prevent *this*, we need an association between IP addresses and the allowed keys for an address, and such does not exist yet.  The first issue should not be too hard to tackle, but it doesn't get us very far without solving the second one.  The options we have here is either another key format that includes addresses associated with the key (which is IMHO a massive compatibility problem) or an additional config file that provides that associations. The additional config data takes a bit more effort to maintain, but it might be more secure and provide a better migration path.  An additional step could 'quarantine' key material that has been found to be used in fraudulent ways, e.g. by moving it into another directory (so it cannot be used again) and dropping the autokey from the key store.  Am I missing something vital here, or would implementing these 3 steps solve the issue? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-06 11:34:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c2)) > I think that there may be a problem here. Once an association has been > authenticated then that packets between the two systems need to continue to use > the key used for creating that association trust.

Otherwise, according to the report, any other valid > key in the list can be used, probably by a rogue server that has a trusted key > which can spoof the packets.  Danny, please say more.  There's nothing wrong with there being multiple trusted keys, and since we're talking about UDP here, we have no way of knowing if a client starts talking to a server with "trusted key #1" and then the client gets reconfigured/restarting using "trusted key #2".  There's no reason this should not work.  What exactly do you mean by an "association" here?  I can still see it being a reasonable conclusion that this report is not a valid bug. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-15 10:26:57 UTC  ``` Thinking about implementing:   trustedkey <keyid> ... [ from <ip> ...]  for a first pass at a solution. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c6)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-20 12:14:26 UTC  ``` Resolved in 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.90. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c7)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-21 23:08:46 UTC  ``` The solution is to have the ntp.keys file contain an optional 4th column, a comma-separated list of IPs that are allowed to serve time.  This is documented in the ntp.keys documentation.  We still need to update html/authentic.html - see [bug 2997](show_bug.cgi?id=2997 "CONFIRMED - html/authentic.html needs an update for the optional IP list in ntp.keys"). ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c8)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 10:25:12 UTC  ``` ACTIVE was fixed - PASSIVE was not. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c9)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 10:34:58 UTC  ``` STAGED for p7. ``` |  |

There's nothing wrong with there being multiple trusted keys, and since we're talking about UDP here, we have no way of knowing if a client starts talking to a server with "trusted key #1" and then the client gets reconfigured/restarting using "trusted key #2".  There's no reason this should not work.  What exactly do you mean by an "association" here?  I can still see it being a reasonable conclusion that this report is not a valid bug. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-15 10:26:57 UTC  ``` Thinking about implementing:   trustedkey <keyid> ... [ from <ip> ...]  for a first pass at a solution. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c6)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-20 12:14:26 UTC  ``` Resolved in 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.90. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c7)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-21 23:08:46 UTC  ``` The solution is to have the ntp.keys file contain an optional 4th column, a comma-separated list of IPs that are allowed to serve time.  This is documented in the ntp.keys documentation.  We still need to update html/authentic.html - see [bug 2997](show_bug.cgi?id=2997 "CONFIRMED - html/authentic.html needs an update for the optional IP list in ntp.keys"). ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c8)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 10:25:12 UTC  ``` ACTIVE was fixed - PASSIVE was not. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2936#c9)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 10:34:58 UTC  ``` STAGED for p7. ``` |  |
