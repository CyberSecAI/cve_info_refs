{
  "CVE-2015-7974": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NTP daemon (ntpd) does not properly verify the association between a key ID and the peer, allowing an attacker to use any trusted key to authenticate packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication, missing key check.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a valid key can impersonate any other peer with a different key, potentially manipulating the time synchronization process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A man-in-the-middle attack where a malicious actor intercepts and modifies NTP packets, using a valid but incorrect key.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a valid symmetric key trusted by the target system and must be positioned on the network to intercept and forge NTP packets."
