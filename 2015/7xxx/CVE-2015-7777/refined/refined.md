Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7777:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the Void CMS.
- The specific location of the vulnerability is in the `index.php` file, where the `$siteroot` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the `<base href>` tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). Specifically, a reflected XSS.
- The `siteroot` variable is used directly in the `<base href>` without encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's web browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable `<base href>` tag. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
  - Cookie theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Data theft
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network.
- An attacker can inject malicious script in the `siteroot` parameter.
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the value of `$siteroot`.
- No authentication is needed.
- The attacker would need to construct a malicious URL containing the injected javascript in the `$siteroot` variable and lure victims to click on it.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves using `htmlspecialchars()` with `ENT_QUOTES` when outputting `$siteroot` into the `<base href>` tag.
- The vulnerability was reported by Gen Sato of TRADE WORKS Co.,Ltd. Security Dept.
- The affected versions of Void are those released prior to October 2, 2015.
