Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Apache ActiveMQ client exposing a remote shutdown command within the `ActiveMQConnection` class. This allowed a compromised broker to send a shutdown command directly to a connected client, causing a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposed Remote Shutdown Command:** The client unnecessarily handles `ControlCommand` messages, specifically the shutdown command, making it vulnerable to remote exploitation.
*   **Lack of Proper Command Validation/Authorization:** The client does not validate the source or legitimacy of the shutdown command, allowing an attacker to trigger it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can force a connected ActiveMQ client to shut down, disrupting its operations and potentially causing service outages or data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Broker:** An attacker gains access to a compromised ActiveMQ broker.
*   **Malicious Command Injection:** The attacker injects a specially crafted `ControlCommand` message with the shutdown command through the compromised broker.
*   **Targeted Client:** The compromised broker sends the shutdown command to any connected client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised ActiveMQ Broker:** The attacker must have control over or access to an ActiveMQ broker.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send messages through the broker to the targeted client.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in ActiveMQ versions 5.14.5 and 5.15.0.
*   The fix involved removing the unnecessary handling of `ControlCommand` messages in the client.
*   The upstream commit addressing this issue is at <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=b8fc78e> and is related to [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6470)
*   The issue is classified as having "Major" priority by Apache.
