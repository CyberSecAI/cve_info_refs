Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types, specifically arbitrary Java code, through the "Ice Faces" servlet in the AggreGate SCADA/HMI Server Service. This allows for the importation of application properties via uploaded XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload malicious Java code.
*   **XML Injection:** The application parses uploaded XML files to import application properties, which can be abused to introduce malicious code.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and commands on the vulnerable system.
*   **System-Level Access:** The attacker can achieve code execution with the privileges of the SYSTEM user, which grants complete control over the system.
*  **Full compromise:** An attacker can achieve full confidentiality, integrity, and availability loss due to the system level access

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers interact with the vulnerable service through HTTP requests, specifically by uploading malicious XML files via the "Ice Faces" servlet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.
*   **Low Skill:** According to ICS-CERT, an attacker with low skill could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Needed**: No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Tibbo AggreGate SCADA/HMI versions 5.21.02 and prior.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2015-7912.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned to the vulnerability (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod).
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '20813'.
