- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM SPSS Statistics uses Python scripts that have write permissions to "Everyone".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure file permissions on Python scripts within the IBM SPSS Statistics application. The vulnerability allows any local user to modify the Python code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can insert malicious OS commands into the Python code. These commands will be executed when another user (e.g., an administrator) opens SPSS and uses the affected module. This can lead to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user who executes the malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system where IBM SPSS Statistics is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to write to the Python scripts used by IBM SPSS Statistics.
