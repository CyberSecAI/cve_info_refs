Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs when parsing a specific file type (.vlp). The Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE fails to properly validate the length of the filename within the file, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The primary issue is that the application doesn't check the size of the filename when parsing a .vlp file. This allows an attacker to provide an overly long filename which overwrites data in the heap.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core problem lies in the insufficient input validation, specifically, the lack of length check on filenames during file parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system where the vulnerable Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE is installed.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can achieve code execution under the context of the local administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted .vlp file that contains a filename that exceeds the buffer's capacity, triggering the overflow during parsing.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, requiring the user to open a malicious file, or visit a malicious page which loads the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Medium Skill Level:** The advisory states that a medium-skilled attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Unitronics has released an updated version of VisiLogic (V9.8.09) to address this vulnerability.
*   The advisory also highlights other vulnerabilities in the same software, but those are separate CVEs (CVE-2015-6478 and CVE-2015-7905).
