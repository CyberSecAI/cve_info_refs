[News](https://adamcaudill.com/categories/news)

*Since this was published, more detailed information has become available: analysis of the [SSH backdoor](https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2015/12/20/cve-2015-7755-juniper-screenos-authentication-backdoor), the [VPN backdoor](https://rpw.sh/blog/2015/12/21/the-backdoored-backdoor/), and the [cryptography of the VPN backdoor](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/12/on-juniper-backdoor.html). If you want a more detailed understanding of what was done, please take a moment to read these pages.*

The news is tearing through the information security community – Juniper seems to be on the lips of everyone now, let’s take a quick look at the information available:

> Woah! Juniper discovers a backdoor to decrypt VPN traffic (and remote admin) has been inserted into their OS source <https://t.co/vAywOclxLt>
>
> — the grugq (@thegrugq) [December 17, 2015](https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/677611480041127936)

This morning, Juniper Networks [announced](https://forums.juniper.net/t5/Security-Incident-Response/Important-Announcement-about-ScreenOS/ba-p/285554) an out-of-cycle update for their ScreenOS firewall operating system ([not the newer Junos](https://twitter.com/llorenzin/status/677663294132457472)) to patch two unrelated issues (both identified as [CVE-2015-7755](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7755)):

* Unauthorized remote administrative access
* VPN traffic decryption

The meat of the announcement is this one paragraph:

> During a recent internal code review, Juniper *discovered unauthorized code* in ScreenOS that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to NetScreen® devices and to decrypt VPN connections. Once we identified these vulnerabilities, we launched an investigation into the matter, and worked to develop and issue patched releases for the latest versions of ScreenOS.

I added emphasis to the most important part: code that wasn’t authorized was first released in September 2012, and only now discovered.

They provided very limited [technical information](https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713&cat=SIRT_1&actp=LIST); there is some detail on the unauthorized remote administrative access – the log, *if not altered*, will reveal that the backdoor has been used, as it will log that `system` connected over SSH instead of an actual user name.

This is the kind of log entry that you would expect in the case of a backdoor that was intentionally hidden – it could easily be looked over, it doesn’t immediately stand out. When designing a backdoor, keeping it subtle is key.

The second issue, decryption of VPN traffic, has no useful information – other than an attacker needs the ability to monitor the encrypted VPN traffic. What this means is that it would only be useful to an attacker that was able to monitor networks – so it would be of most value to nation-state level attackers.

For both vulnerabilities, they state that a *knowledgeable attacker* could do this – to me, that smacks of NOBUS, or nobody but us, a key strategy for NSA and similar attackers. Attacks that require the knowledge of some secret that couldn’t be easily learned, allowing them to take advantage of it, while keeping risks of others exploiting it as low as possible.

Some are speculating that this could be [FEEDTHROUGH](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html):

> In the case of Juniper, the name of this particular digital lock pick is “FEEDTROUGH.” This malware burrows into Juniper firewalls and makes it possible to smuggle other NSA programs into mainframe computers. Thanks to FEEDTROUGH, these implants can, by design, even survive “across reboots and software upgrades.” In this way, US government spies can secure themselves a permanent presence in computer networks. The catalog states that FEEDTROUGH “has been deployed on many target platforms.”

![nsa-ant-feedthrough](https://adamcaudill.com/files/nsa-ant-feedthrough.jpg)

Is this FEEDTHROUGH? Is this a backdoor to make it easier to install FEEDTHROUGH ([interdiction](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/) can’t be cheap)? It’s hard to say – as is the case with many of the [ANT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog) documents, there simply isn’t enough details to tell if they are connected.

My hope when the story broke was that it was debugging code that was inserted into a production release, or something of that nature – at this point I’m losing hope. It’s exactly what an intentional backdoor would look like. We shouldn’t speculate too much, but this doesn’t look good.

*While writing this, [Dan Goodin](https://twitter.com/dangoodin001) published [his article](https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/12/unauthorized-code-in-juniper-firewalls-decrypts-encrypted-vpn-traffic/) on this – go read it.*

***Update:*** [HD Moore](https://twitter.com/hdmoore) posted a list of the [modified strings](https://gist.github.com/hdm/0fbaf7408a6c7e0566c5); a change caught my eye, and was [pointed out](https://twitter.com/chort0/status/677708218206957568) soon after HD posted it. In the version where the backdoors were introduced, a constant was changed:

```
-2c55e5e45edf713dc43475effe8813a60326a64d9ba3d2e39cb639b0f3b0ad10
+9585320EEAF81044F20D55030A035B11BECE81C785E6C933E4A8A131F6578107

```

This changed was [reverted](https://gist.github.com/hdm/107614ea292e856faa81) in the fixed version, making it clear that this plays some role in the backdoor – as researched progressed, it was suggested that it was a custom `y` coordinate, or perhaps a public key.

At this point, it appears to be [Dual EC DRBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG), which has a documented history of being vulnerable to backdooring – at this point, it seems that may be what happened here. The patch by Juniper didn’t remove Dual EC DRBG, but revert the change to it. This makes a lot of sense, as this is a NOBUS backdoor – it requires knowledge of a secret to be able to exploit, which fits with the description that Juniper provided.

Research is still ongoing.

  Researchers are still working to understand the impact of the Juniper incident – the details of how the VPN traffic decryption backdoor are still not fully understood. That such devastating backdoors could make it in to such a security-critical product, and remain for years undetected has shocked many (and pushed many others deeper into their cynicism).
  There are though, some questions that are far more important in the long run:
* ### [Crypto Front Door: Everyone Welcome!](https://adamcaudill.com/2015/04/13/crypto-front-door-everyone-welcome/ "Crypto Front Door: Everyone Welcome!")

  For decades, the US Government has fought — sometimes with itself — to prevent the use of secure cryptography. During the first crypto war, they allowed strong cryptography within the US, but other countries were limited to small keys — making brute force attacks practical. But what about those pesky US citizens? They didn’t really want them to have strong crypto either — enter key escrow.
  What is key escrow? According to Wikipedia:
* ### [Verizon Hum Leaking Credentials](https://adamcaudill.com/2015/12/25/verizon-hum-leaking-credentials/ "Verizon Hum Leaking Credentials")

  or, Christmas Infosec Insanity…
  A friend mentioned Hum by Verizon, a product that I hadn’t heard of but quickly caught my attention – both from a “here’s a privacy nightmare” perspective, and “I might actually use that” perspective. While looking at the site, I decided to take a look at the source code for the shopping page – what I saw was rather unexpected.
  Near the top is a large block of JSON assigned to an otherwise unused variable named phpvars – included was some validation code, a number of URLs, some HTML, and the like.
* ### [The Door to Nowhere](https://adamcaudill.com/2015/12/12/the-door-to-nowhere/ "The Door to Nowhere")

  Today I was walking around, exploring the local downtown area, and I noticed a door. Or more accurately, what used to be a door, and the symbolism was too perfect to ignore. It’s a door to nowhere.
  A door once stood here, carefully built, thoughtfully placed, well crafted. Long ago someone decided that they didn’t want the door to exist anymore — so they filled it in. They made an attempt at reversing the decisions of the past to suit their desire at the moment — but they couldn’t.
* ### [Win by Building for Failure](https://adamcaudill.com/2021/08/22/win-by-building-for-failure/ "Win by Building for Failure")

  Systems fail; it doesn’t matter what the system is. Something will fail sooner or later. When you design a system, are you focused on the happy path, or are you building with the possibility of failure in mind?
  If you suffered a data breach tomorrow, what would the impact be? Does the system prevent loss by design, or does it just fall apart? Can you easily minimize loss and damage, or would an attacker have free rein once they get in?

# Juniper Says It Didn't Work With Government To Add 'Unauthorized Code' To Network Gear

Networking giant
[Juniper Networks](/companies/juniper-networks/)
 yesterday revealed some nasty vulnerabilities in its ScreenOS, the operating system controlling its firewalls. One was particularly shocking - "unauthorized code" that could have allowed a "knowledgeable" hacker to gain administrative access to the firewall and could even monitor encrypted traffic going through supposedly more secure Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

The [security](http://www.forbes.com/security/) world immediately pondered how "unauthorized code" made its way into ScreenOS, some using
[Twitter](/companies/twitter/)
 to suggest a government could well have been responsible. The National Security Agency (NSA), for instance, was known to have tampered with American technology companies' kit to carry out pervasive surveillance. In 2013, German publication [Der Spiegel revealed](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html), via a leaked catalogue, that the NSA had malware named "FEEDTROUGH" that targeted Juniper firewalls. The malware was persistent, capable of surviving "across reboots and software upgrades", and "has been deployed on many target platforms."

But Juniper denied it had ever worked with any government to install backdoors in its systems. "As we’ve stated previously, Juniper Networks takes allegations of this nature very seriously," a spokesperson told FORBES over email. "To be clear, we do not work with governments or anyone else to purposely introduce weaknesses or vulnerabilities into our products.

"As a company that consistently operates with the highest of ethical standards, we are committed to maintaining the integrity, security, and assurance of our products. Once this code was discovered we worked to produce a fix and notify customers of the issues." Indeed, this vulnerability and another backdoor in ScreenOS, which could have allowed "complete compromise of the affected system", were fixed by Juniper this week.

Juniper said it wouldn't comment further on any investigation into the code in question. The firm could well be unaware a government, or another party, was doing something surreptitious. Juniper admitted an attacker exploiting the unauthorized code would not have left any evidence. "There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited," it wrote in an [advisory](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713&actp=search).

Its believed the problem stems back to 2012, leaving a good amount of time for malicious hackers to have spied on any traffic going through Junper's boxes.

| According to Juniper Security Advisory #10713:   *During an internal code review, two security issues were identified.**Administrative Access (CVE-2015-7755) allows unauthorized remote administrative access to the device. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the affected device.* *This issue only affects ScreenOS 6.3.0r17 through 6.3.0r20.  No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.**This issue has been assigned* [*CVE-2015-7755*](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7755)*VPN Decryption (CVE-2015-7756) may allow a knowledgeable attacker who can monitor VPN traffic to decrypt that traffic. It is independent of the first issue.**This issue affects ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20. No other Juniper products or versions of ScreenOS are affected by this issue.**There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited.**This issue has been assigned* [*CVE-2015-7756*](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7756)*.**Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of these vulnerabilities, however the password needed for the administrative access has been revealed publicly.**No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by these issues.* For more information, please see Juniper Security Advisory [#10713.](https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713&cat=SIRT_1&actp=LIST) |

### Impact

| An unauthorized remote attacker could gain privileged access to the device and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of its data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Juniper has issued [guidance](https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713&cat=SIRT_1&actp=LIST) to install the patched versions of ScreenOS.**Restrict Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. |

An operating system used to manage firewalls sold by Juniper Networks contains unauthorized code that surreptitiously decrypts traffic sent through virtual private networks, officials from the company warned Thursday.

It's not clear how the code got there or how long it has been there. An [advisory published by the company](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Security-Incident-Response/Important-Announcement-about-ScreenOS/ba-p/285554) said that NetScreen firewalls using ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20 are affected and require immediate patching. [Release notes](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/screenos/screenos6.2.0/) published by Juniper suggest the earliest vulnerable versions date back to at least 2012 and possibly earlier. There's no evidence right now that the backdoor was put in other Juniper OSes or devices.

"During a recent internal code review, Juniper discovered unauthorized code in ScreenOS that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to NetScreen devices and to decrypt VPN connections," Juniper Chief Information officer Bob Worrall wrote. "Once we identified these vulnerabilities, we launched an investigation into the matter, and worked to develop and issue patched releases for the latest versions of ScreenOS."

A [separate advisory](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713) from Juniper says there are two separate vulnerabilities, but stops short of describing either as "unauthorized code." The first flaw allows unauthorized remote administrative access to an affected device over SSH or telnet. Exploits can lead to complete compromise. "The second issue may allow a knowledgeable attacker who can monitor VPN traffic to decrypt that traffic," the advisory said. "It is independent of the first issue. There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited."

## Whodunit?

Word that the VPN-breaking code was the result of unauthorized code, as opposed to an inadvertent programming flaw, touched off immediate concern that ScreenOS had been deliberately tampered with. The most likely culprit for such tampering would be the NSA or one of its many counterparts around the world. Classified documents leaked by former NSA subcontractor Edward Snowden showed NSA agents [intercepting network gear from Cisco Systems as it was being shipped to a customer](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/). They installed covert implant firmware onto the device before sending it to its final destination.

As involved as that process was, getting unauthorized code covertly installed into an official operating system and keeping it there for years would appear to be an even more complicated—and brazen—undertaking. This [2013 article](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html) published by *Der Spiegel* reported that an NSA operation known as FEEDTROUGH worked against Juniper firewalls and gave the agency persistent backdoor access.

"This malware burrows into Juniper firewalls and makes it possible to smuggle other NSA programs into mainframe computers," the article reported. "Thanks to FEEDTROUGH, these implants can, by design, even survive 'across reboots and software upgrades.' In this way, US government spies can secure themselves a permanent presence in computer networks. The catalog states that FEEDTROUGH 'has been deployed on many target platforms.'"

Of course, it's also possible the backdoor was installed some other way. Juniper's advisory makes no mention who it suspects is behind the move or what steps it's taking to find out. Ars has asked Juniper for more details and will update this post as warranted.

# Secret Code Found in Juniper's Firewalls Shows Risk of Government Backdoors

Suspicious code found in Juniper's firewall software underscores why governments shouldn't be allowed to install their own backdoors in software.![backdoorsecurity594373387](https://media.wired.com/photos/5955a786ad90646d424bb223/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/backdoor-security-594373387.jpg)Man lifting empty spotlit circle and entering hole belowGetty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySave

Encryption backdoors have been a hot topic in the last few years—and the controversial issue got even hotter after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, when it [dominated media headlines](https://www.wired.com/2015/11/paris-attacks-cia-director-john-brennan-what-he-gets-wrong-about-encryption-backdoors/). It even came up during this week's [Republican presidential candidate debate](https://www.wired.com/2015/12/gop-debate-internet/). But despite all the attention focused on backdoors lately, no one noticed that someone had quietly installed backdoors three years ago in a core piece of networking equipment used to protect corporate and government systems around the world.

On Thursday, tech giant Juniper Networks revealed in a [startling announcement](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Security-Incident-Response/Important-Announcement-about-ScreenOS/ba-p/285554) that it had found "unauthorized" code embedded in an operating system running on some of its firewalls.

The code, which appears to have been in multiple versions of the company's ScreenOS software going back to at least August 2012, would have allowed attackers to take complete control of [Juniper NetScreen firewalls](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/security/netscreen/) running the affected software. It also would allow attackers, if they had ample resources and skills, to separately decrypt encrypted traffic running through the [Virtual Private Network, or VPN, on the firewalls](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB8402&actp=search).

"During a recent internal code review, Juniper discovered unauthorized code in ScreenOS that could allow a knowledgeable attacker to gain administrative access to NetScreen devices and to decrypt VPN connections," Bob Worrall, the companies' CIO wrote in a post. "Once we identified these vulnerabilities, we launched an investigation into the matter, and worked to develop and issue patched releases for the latest versions of ScreenOS."

> 'This is a very good showcase for why backdoors are really something governments should not have in these types of devices because at some point it will backfire.'

Juniper released patches for the software yesterday and advised customers to install them immediately, noting that firewalls using ScreenOS 6.2.0r15 through 6.2.0r18 and 6.3.0r12 through 6.3.0r20 are vulnerable. [Release notes for 6.2.0r15](http://gold.nvc.co.jp/supports/Juniper/OS/Release_Notes/OS6.2/rn-620-r15.pdf) show that version being released in September 2012, while [release notes for 6.3.0r12](http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/screenos/screenos6.3.0/rn-630-r12.pdf) show that the latter version was issued in August 2012.

The security community is particularly alarmed because at least one of the backdoors appears to be the work of a sophisticated nation-state attacker.

"The weakness in the VPN itself that enables passive decryption is only of benefit to a national surveillance agency like the British, the US, the Chinese, or the Israelis," says Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute and UC Berkeley. "You need to have wiretaps on the internet for that to be a valuable change to make [in the software]."

But the backdoors are also a concern because one of them—a hardcoded master password left behind in Juniper's software by the attackers—will now allow anyone else to take command of Juniper firewalls that administrators have not yet patched, once the attackers have figured out the password by examining Juniper's code.

Ronald Prins, founder and CTO of [Fox-IT](https://www.fox-it.com/en/), a Dutch security firm, said the patch released by Juniper provides hints about where the master password backdoor is located in the software. By reverse-engineering the firmware on a Juniper firewall, analysts at his company found the password in just six hours.

"Once you know there is a backdoor there, ... the patch [Juniper released] gives away where to look for [the backdoor] … which you can use to log into every [Juniper] device using the Screen OS software," he told WIRED. "We are now capable of logging into all vulnerable firewalls in the same way as the actors [who installed the backdoor]."

But there is another concern raised by Juniper's announcement and patches—any *other* nation-state attackers, in addition to the culprits who installed the backdoors, who have intercepted and stored encrypted VPN traffic running through Juniper's firewalls in the past, may now be able to decrypt it, Prins says, by analyzing Juniper's patches and figuring out how the initial attackers were using the backdoor to decrypt it.

"If other state actors are intercepting VPN traffic from those VPN devices, … they will be able to go back in history and be able to decrypt this kind of traffic," he says.

Weaver says this depends on the exact nature of the VPN backdoor. "If it was something like the Dual EC, the backdoor doesn't actually get you in, ... you also need to know the secret. But if it's something like creating a weak key, then anybody who has captured all traffic can decrypt." Dual EC is a reference to an [encryption algorithm](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/nsa-backdoor/) that the NSA is believed to have backdoored in the past to make it weaker. This factor, along with knowledge of a secret key, would allow the agency to undermine the algorithm.

Matt Blaze, a cryptographic researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agrees that the ability to decrypt already-collected Juniper VPN traffic depends on certain factors, but cites a different reason.

"If the VPN backdoor doesn't require you to use the other remote-access [password] backdoor first," then it would be possible to decrypt historical traffic that had been captured, he says. "But I can imagine designing a backdoor in which I have to log into the box using the remote-access backdoor in order to enable the backdoor that lets me decrypt intercepted traffic."

A page on Juniper's web site does appear to show that [it's using the weak Dual EC algorithm in some products](https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB28205&pmv=print&actp=LIST), though Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, says it's still unclear if this is the source of the VPN issue in Juniper's firewalls.

Juniper released two announcements about the problem on Thursday. In a [second more technical advisory](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10713&actp=search), the company described two sets of unauthorized code in the software, which created two backdoors that worked independently of one another, suggesting the password backdoor and the VPN backdoor aren't connected. A Juniper spokeswoman refused to answer questions beyond what was already said in the released statements.

Regardless of the precise nature of the VPN backdoor, the issues raised by this latest incident highlight precisely why security experts and companies like Apple and Google have been arguing against installing encryption backdoors in devices and software to give the US government access to protected communication.

"This is a very good showcase for why backdoors are really something governments should not have in these types of devices because at some point it will backfire," Prins says.

Green says the hypothetical threat around NSA backdoors has always been: What if someone repurposed them against us? If Juniper did use Dual EC, an algorithm long-known to be vulnerable, and this is part of the backdoor in question, it underscores that threat of repurposing by other actors even more.

"The use of Dual EC in ScreenOS ... should make us at least consider the possibility that this may have happened," he told WIRED.

Two Backdoors

The first backdoor Juniper found would give an attacker administrative-level or root privileges over the firewalls—essentially the highest-level of access on a system—when accessing the firewalls remotely via SSH or telnet channels. "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the affected system," Juniper noted.

Although the firewall's log files would show a suspicious entry for someone gaining access over SSH or Telnet, the log would only provide a cryptic message that it was the "system" that had logged on successfully with a password. And Juniper noted that a skilled attacker would likely remove even this cryptic entry from log files to further eliminate any indication that the device had been compromised.

The second backdoor would effectively allow an attacker who has already intercepted VPN traffic passing through the Juniper firewalls to decrypt the traffic without knowing the decryption keys. Juniper said that it had no evidence that this vulnerability had been exploited, but also noted that, "There is no way to detect that this vulnerability was exploited."

Juniper is the second largest maker of networking equipment after Cisco. The Juniper firewalls in question have two functions. The first is to ensure that the right connections have access to a company or government agency's network; the other is to provide secured VPN access to remote workers or others with authorized access to the network. The ScreenOS software running on Juniper firewalls was initially designed by NetScreen, a company that Juniper acquired in 2004. But the versions affected by the backdoors were released under Juniper's watch, eight years after that acquisition.

The company said it discovered the backdoors during an internal code review, but it didn't say if this was a routine review or if it had examined the code specifically after receiving a tip that something suspicious was in it.

Speculation in the security community about who might have installed the unauthorized code centers on the NSA, though it could have been another nation-state actor with similar capabilities, such as the UK, China, Russia, or even Israel.

Prins thinks both backdoors were installed by the same actor, but also notes that the hardcoded master password giving the attackers remote access to the firewalls was too easy to find once they knew it was there. He expects the NSA would not have been so sloppy.
Weaver says it's possible there were two culprits. "It could very well be that the crypto backdoor was [done by] the NSA but the remote-access backdoor was the Chinese or the French or the Israelis or anybody," he told WIRED.

NSA documents released to media in the past show that the agency has put a lot of effort into compromising Juniper firewalls and those made by other companies.

An [NSA spy tool catalogue leaked to *Der Spiegel* in 2013](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html) described a sophisticated NSA implant known as FEEDTROUGH that was designed to maintain a persistent backdoor in Juniper firewalls. FEEDTROUGH, *Der Spiegel* wrote, "burrows into Juniper firewalls and makes it possible to smuggle other NSA programs into mainframe computers….." It's also designed to remain on systems even after they're rebooted or the operating system on them is upgraded. According to the NSA documents, FEEDTROUGH had "been deployed on many target platforms."

FEEDTROUGH, however, appears to be something different than the unauthorized code Juniper describes in its advisories. FEEDTROUGH is a firmware implant—a kind of "aftermarket" spy tool installed on specific targeted devices in the field or before they're delivered to customers. The unauthorized code Juniper found in its software was embedded in the operating system itself and would have infected every customer who purchased products containing the compromised versions of the software.

Naturally, some in the community have questioned whether these were backdoors that Juniper had voluntarily installed for a specific government and decided to disclose only after it became apparent that the backdoor had been discovered by others. But Juniper was quick to dispel those allegations. "Juniper Networks takes allegations of this nature very seriously," the company said in a statement. "To be clear, we do not work with governments or anyone else to purposely introduce weaknesses or vulnerabilities into our products… Once this code was discovered we worked to produce a fix and notify customers of the issues."

Prins says the larger concern now is whether other firewall manufacturers have been compromised in a similar manner. "I hope that other vendors like Cisco and Checkpoint are also now starting a process to review their code to see if they have backdoors inserted," he said.
