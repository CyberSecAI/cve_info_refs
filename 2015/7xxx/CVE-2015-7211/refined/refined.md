  "CVE-2015-7211": {
    "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 mishandles the # (number sign) character in a data: URI, which allows remote attackers to spoof web sites via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The browser incorrectly parses the hash symbol within a data URI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of special characters in data URI",
      "Bypassing of intended restrictions on data URIs"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can spoof web sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activity by misleading users to believe they are on a trusted website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted data URIs with mishandled hash characters"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice the victim to interact with a maliciously crafted URI.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the mishandling of the '#' character within 'data:' URIs. The parser fails to treat the '#' correctly before the ',' separator resulting in the browser interpreting the URI incorrectly. This allows a user to create an arbitrary 'data:' URI with a crafted fragment, tricking the user in the address bar into thinking they're on a trusted website. The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious link to the crafted 'data:' URI and tricking the victim to click on it. This can cause a partial URL spoofing. The fix involved returning `NS_ERROR_MALFORMED_URI` if '#' character is encountered in such contexts."
