{
  "CVE-2015-7969": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leaks in Xen due to improper cleanup of vcpu pointer arrays allocated via XEN_DOMCTL_max_vcpus, XENOPROF_get_buffer, or XENOPROF_set_passive hypercalls.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple memory leaks in Xen's handling of vcpu pointer arrays, which can be allocated by a domain or a toolstack via specific hypercalls.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local guest administrator or a domain with certain privileges can cause a denial of service by exhausting the host's memory through repeated 'teardowns' of domains using the vulnerable hypercalls.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access from a guest administrator or a domain with sufficient privileges using the XEN_DOMCTL_max_vcpus, XENOPROF_get_buffer, or XENOPROF_set_passive hypercalls.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local guest administrator or a domain with the privilege to use the vulnerable hypercalls (e.g., for profiling another domain). Ability to create/restart domains may be needed for full exploitation."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The primary array of vcpu pointers allocated by toolstack is leaked upon domain teardown.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak vulnerability in Xen's domain teardown process.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service attack affecting the entire system, achieved by exhausting the host's memory over time.",
      "Attack vectors": "A domain that has partial management control via XEN_DOMCTL_max_vcpus can exploit this.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires the ability to create/restart domains to fully exploit the issue; without it, the leak is limited."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A domain's xenoprofile state contains an array of per-vcpu information, allocated in response to XENOPROF_get_buffer or XENOPROF_set_passive hypercalls, which is leaked on domain teardown.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak in Xen when tearing down domains using profiling-related hypercalls.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service by exhausting host memory through repeated domain teardowns.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local guest administrator via XENOPROF_get_buffer or privileged domain via XENOPROF_set_passive.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires local guest administrator access or a domain with the ability to profile another domain, also needs to be able to create or reboot domains for a more effective attack."
