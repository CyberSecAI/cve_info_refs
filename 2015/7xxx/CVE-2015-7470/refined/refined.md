Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is not explicitly stated, but the vulnerability stems from the lack of secure communication protocols, leading to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** The Jazz Reporting Service (JRS) does not adequately secure communication channels, which enables an attacker to intercept and potentially modify data transmitted between the user and the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information, including login credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed over a network and involves intercepting communications between the user and the JRS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** An attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the user and the JRS server to intercept the communication. This could involve being on the same network, compromising a network device, or using other MITM techniques.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have pre-existing credentials on the Jazz Reporting Service to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Jazz Reporting Service versions 5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2, and 6.0.
- The document also includes information about other vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7464, CVE-2015-7467, CVE-2015-7468, CVE-2015-7469) affecting the same product.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, which usually just includes a brief description of the vulnerability and its impact.
