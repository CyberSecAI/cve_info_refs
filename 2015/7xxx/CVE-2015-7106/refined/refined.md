Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `IntelAccelerator::gstqConfigure` function within the Intel Graphics Driver. The `GSTContextKernel` pointer is initialized to NULL in the `start` method. The vulnerable `gstqConfigure` method is called by `IGAccelDevice`'s external method `gst_configure` (0x206), without checking if the `GSTContextKernel` pointer is NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null Pointer Dereference: The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.
- Lack of Input Validation: The `gstqConfigure` method does not validate if the GSTContextKernel pointer has been properly initialized, resulting in the dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation leads to a kernel panic due to the null pointer dereference, causing the system to crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: The vulnerability is in the Intel Graphics Driver, which operates at a high privilege level. If the null pointer dereference could be controlled, arbitrary code execution could potentially be achieved. As the proof of concept shows, by controlling a pointer within `GSTContextKernel` a kernel virtual method call can be hijacked by writing a fake vtable containing a controlled kernel address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker: The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `gst_configure` method (0x206) on the `IntelAccelerator` I/O Kit driver after obtaining a user client connection (type 1). The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- I/O Kit Interaction: The attacker must have the capability to interact with I/O Kit drivers and open user client connections to the `IntelAccelerator` driver.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code explicitly maps the null page as read/write to facilitate the null pointer dereference exploit.
- The vulnerability was tested on OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 (15b42).
- The vulnerability was found by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero, Juwei Lin of TrendMicro, beist and ABH of BoB, and JeongHoon Shin@A.D.D.
- The vulnerability is fixed in OS X El Capitan 10.11.2.
