CVE-2015-7677
VENDOR Reference:
=================
http://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/DMZ82/ReleaseNotes/MOVEitReleaseNotes82.pdf
Reference Number: MIDMZ-6126
Vulnerability Details:
======================
It is possible to enumerate valid FileIDs by using the MOVEitISAPI service.
According to whether a FileID exists or not, a different error message is returned from the server.
It is possible to write a program which automatically tries different FileIDs and
identifies existing FileIDs. Those FileIDs may later be used for unauthorized access the corresponding file using vulnerability
CVE-2015-7675 (https://profundis-labs.com/advisories/CVE-2015-7675.txt).
To exploit this vulnerability, the following information is needed:
- A valid user account (user session)
PoC code(s):
============
POST /MOVEitISAPI/MOVEitISAPI.dll?action=download HTTP/1.1
Host:
...
X-siLock-FileID:
The response from server can be evaluated as followed:
- FileID exists but user is not permitted, error message:
"Sie sind nicht zum Lesen dieser Datei berechtigt" (Error message is in German, it may differ in setups with other languages)
- FileID does not exist, error message: No such file ID "" (this error message is always in English)
Remark: Values in Brakets are placeholders.
