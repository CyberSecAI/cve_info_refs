Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `xmlGROW` function of the libxml2 library. The `xmlGROW` function is used to dynamically allocate memory and increase the size of existing memory buffers. A flaw in how this function handles certain inputs during XML or HTML parsing can cause it to write past the intended boundaries of the allocated memory region.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   Heap-based buffer overflow: The primary weakness is the ability to write beyond the allocated buffer, corrupting adjacent memory on the heap. This arises from insufficient size checks or calculations when expanding memory using `xmlGROW` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Denial of service (DoS): By overflowing the heap buffer, an attacker can cause the application using libxml2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
-   Potential Information Disclosure: The overflow allows the attacker to read data from memory out of bounds. Although not explicitly stated in all sources, reading beyond buffer limits can lead to leakage of sensitive data present in that memory region.

**Attack vectors:**

-   Specially crafted XML or HTML files: The primary attack vector involves providing malformed XML or HTML files as input to applications using the vulnerable libxml2 library. This input triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   Remote attacker: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted XML or HTML file to the application using libxml2. This can be achieved remotely in scenarios where the application accepts external user-controlled input.

-   No authentication required: The vulnerability does not require the attacker to be authenticated or have any specific user privileges. It can be triggered by simply feeding the application a malicious document.

**Additional details from content:**

-   The vulnerability occurs within the `xmlGROW` function and that it can lead to out-of-bounds reads allowing attackers to potentially read sensitive information from the process's memory space
-   Multiple vendor bug reports and patch details were referenced.
-   Specific upstream commit IDs, which fixed this issue in the libxml2 library, was included in some reports: `28cd9cb747a94483f4aea7f0968d202c20bb4cfc` and `35bcb1d758ed70aa7b257c9c3b3ff55e54e3d0da`.
-   Some of the bug reports mentioned the denial of service aspect of the vulnerability, and that the crafted documents could lead to application crashes.
