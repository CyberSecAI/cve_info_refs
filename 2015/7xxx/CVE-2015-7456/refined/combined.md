# IBM Spectrum Scale is affected by a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7456)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in the current levels of IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1 thru 4.1.1.3 and V4.2.0.0 that could allow a local unprivileged user, or a user with network access to the IBM Spectrum Scale cluster, to access admin passwords for object storage infrastructure. This vulnerability only affects clusters which have installed and deployed the Object protocol.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7456](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7456)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.0 thru 4.1.1.3 and V4.2.0.0

## Remediation/Fixes

The following fixes will need to be applied to all nodes in the cluster regardless of whether they are configured as protocol nodes or not.

For all IBM Spectrum Scale nodes V4.1.1.0 thru 4.1.1.3, apply 4.1.1.4 available at <http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=4.1.1&platform=All&function=all>

For all IBM Spectrum Scale nodes V4.2.0.0 , contact IBM Service and request an efix for APARIV79381 and follow the instructions in the associated README.

After all nodes have either been upgraded to 4.1.1.4 or had the efix applied, run the following commands:

* + mmchconfig release=LATEST

    mmlsconfig minReleaseLevel

Verify the reported value of **minReleaseLevel** is 4.1.1.4 or higher. Note that applying the V4.2 efix will not result in **minReleaseLevel** being changed.

## Workarounds and Mitigations
