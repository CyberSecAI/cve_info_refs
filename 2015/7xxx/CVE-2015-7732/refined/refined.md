- Root cause of vulnerability: The Avira Mobile Security iOS application sends login information via an HTTP POST, with the password insufficiently protected by the insecure MD5 algorithm.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cleartext transmission of login credentials over HTTP, use of the insecure MD5 algorithm for password protection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker who can sniff network traffic could capture usernames, passwords, and sensitive information without the user's knowledge.
- Attack vectors: Network traffic sniffing (man-in-the-middle attack).
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the application and the server.
