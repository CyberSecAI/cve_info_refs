    "root_cause": "The ZyXEL NBG-418N router contains a global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. In combination with default credentials (CVE-2015-7283), an attacker can establish an active session as part of an attack and therefore would not require a victim to be logged in.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can induce a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request.",
       "Remote, unauthenticated attacker, leveraging default credentials (CVE-2015-7283), can establish an active session and then perform actions with administrative privileges."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim user with an active session to trigger the malicious request. If combined with the default credentials vulnerability, the attacker can establish the session."
