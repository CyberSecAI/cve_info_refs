Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of two flaws within the IBM System Networking Switch Center (SNSC) Web Service:
1.  **Race Condition:** A race condition allows temporary use of a privileged account that is normally forbidden from interactive login.
2.  **Directory Traversal:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the `FileReader.jsp` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Race Condition:** This allows unauthorized access to a privileged account.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The `FileReader.jsp` vulnerability allows an attacker to read files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By exploiting these two vulnerabilities in combination, an attacker can read arbitrary text files on the system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or other data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is network-based, targeting the IBM SNSC Web Service. The web service listens on ports 40080 (HTTP) or 40443 (HTTPS) by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service on ports 40080 or 40443.
*   Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that IBM has released an update to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-06-25, with a public release on 2015-11-10.

The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description, particularly regarding the race condition aspect of the vulnerability.
