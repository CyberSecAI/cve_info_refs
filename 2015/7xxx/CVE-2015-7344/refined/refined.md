Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the HikaShop Joomla component's update controller, specifically when handling the `field_id`, `field_type`, and `field_namekey` parameters. Although Joomla's `getString` function attempts to filter HTML, it doesn't prevent attribute injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The `getString` function in Joomla, used to retrieve the input, does not fully strip HTML attributes, allowing for injection via crafted payloads.
- The vulnerability exists in the backoffice/control panel of HikaShop, limiting its direct impact on public-facing pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the administrator's control panel through the vulnerable parameters.
- Successful exploitation could lead to an administrator session takeover, allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions, potentially compromising the entire site.
-  The attacker could also potentially steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the HikaShop's update controller within the Joomla administrator panel.
- The attacker must craft a specific URL containing the vulnerable parameters with malicious payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable component and its parameters.
- The attacker must be able to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a crafted URL (Social Engineering).
- The vulnerability exists in the administrative section, so the attacker does not need to be an admin, just able to convince an admin to click the link.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious payloads such as `"onmouseover%3d"alert('XSS')"` into any of the `field_id`, `field_type`, or `field_namekey` parameters in the request.
The Joomla `getString` function is intended to sanitize input by removing tags, however, it can be bypassed by injecting malicious attributes that can trigger JavaScript execution.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- HikaShop version 2.5.0

**Solution:**
- Update to HikaShop version 2.6.0 or later, which contains the necessary fix.
