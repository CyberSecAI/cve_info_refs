Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the Komento Joomla! component when processing user comments, specifically when using the WYSIWYG editor with image and URL tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within comment image or URL tags and stored in the database. This code is then executed whenever the comment is displayed to other users, either in the frontend or the backend administrator interface.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The Komento component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `[img]` and `[url]` tags, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Vulnerable WYSIWYG Editor:**  The use of a WYSIWYG editor in comments allowed attackers to easily inject malicious code through the image and URL functionalities without needing to manually write the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Frontend User Impact:** When a user visits a page containing a comment with embedded XSS, the malicious JavaScript will execute in their browser. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site.
    - Steal cookies/session information, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Deface the page.
    - Execute arbitrary code in the user's browser

- **Backend Administrator Impact:** If an administrator views a comment containing the malicious XSS in the backend, the malicious script will execute, potentially leading to:
    - Account hijacking of the administrator.
    - Data manipulation or theft.
    - Full control of the website by the attacker.
    - Complete compromise of the website if the admin has enough permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the comment submission form within the Komento component.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript within the `[img]` tag's `onload` attribute or within the `[url]` tag's `onmouseover` attribute.
- The malicious payload is stored in the database as part of a comment.
- The XSS payload is triggered when the comment is rendered in either the frontend or backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to post comments on a website that uses the vulnerable Komento Joomla! extension. This might not require a high level of access or privilege, depending on the specific website settings.
- No other special position or capability is needed.
- The attacker does not need to interact with the victim directly; the victim will be affected by simply visiting the page.

**Technical Details**

The attacker can inject the following payload via the `[img]` tag:

```
[img]http://www.robolaranja.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Primeira-imagem-do-filme-de-Angry-Birds-%C3%A9-revelada-2.jpg" onload="prompt(1)[/img]
```

or the following payload via the `[url]` tag:

```
[url="https://www.davidsopas.com" onmouseover="prompt(1)"]Your text to link[/url]
```

The component outputs the following HTML (in the frontend) for the `[img]` tag:

```html
<img src="http://www.robolaranja.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Primeira-imagem-do-filme-de-Angry-Birds-%C3%A9-revelada-2.jpg" data-pagespeed-onload="prompt(1)" alt="http://www.robolaranja.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Primeira-imagem-do-filme-de-Angry-Birds-%C3%A9-revelada-2.jpg" onload="prompt(1)" style="max-width:300px;max-height:300px;" onload="var elem=this;if (this==window) elem=document.body;elem.setAttribute(‘data-pagespeed-loaded’, 1)"/>
```

or:

```html
<img src="http://www.robolaranja.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Primeira-imagem-do-filme-de-Angry-Birds-%C3%A9-revelada-2.jpg" data-pagespeed-onload="prompt(1)" alt="http://www.robolaranja.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Primeira-imagem-do-filme-de-Angry-Birds-%C3%A9-revelada-2.jpg" onload="prompt(1)" style="max-width:300px;max-height:300px;">
```

The `onload="prompt(1)"` attribute is inserted directly into the HTML, and executes when the page loads and the image rendering is completed.

**Affected Versions:**
All Komento versions prior to 2.0.5 are vulnerable.

**Patch:**
The vulnerability was patched in Komento version 2.0.5.
