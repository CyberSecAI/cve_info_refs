Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) password is inadvertently displayed in plain text within the application trace output when the `changetsmpassword` command is executed while application tracing is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Password Exposure:** The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive password information in a human-readable format within trace files. This is a violation of secure coding practices.
*   **Insecure Logging Practices:** The application's logging mechanism does not adequately sanitize or mask sensitive data before including it in trace output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the trace logs containing the plaintext password could use it to gain unauthorized access to the TSM environment, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or disruption of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the TSM account's permissions, the attacker could gain control over the storage infrastructure and related resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Trace Logs:** An attacker needs to obtain access to the application trace output files generated by the affected products. This could be achieved by compromising the server where these files are stored, or via exfiltration if accessible remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to System:** The attacker must have access to the filesystem where trace logs are written by the affected IBM products. This could be through local access to the system where the IBM application is installed, through compromised credentials, or exploiting another vulnerability which allows them to gain access to the server.
*   **Trace Files Enabled:** The attacker must have access to trace files generated when tracing is enabled during the `changetsmpassword` command execution.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would likely need to have knowledge of this specific vulnerability to look for the password in the trace output.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected products include:
    *   Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager on Windows
    *   Tivoli Storage Manager for Databases: Data Protection for Microsoft SQL Server
    *   Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange Server
*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the applications to prevent TSM password disclosure in trace files during TSM password update operations.
*   Workarounds include:
    *   Avoiding changing TSM passwords with tracing enabled.
    *   Deleting existing application trace files that may contain the password.
*   The vulnerability is associated with APAR number IT11349.
*   Fixes are available in the form of patch files to update the software, preventing the plaintext exposure in logs.
