{
  "CVE-2015-7577": {
    "Description": "activerecord/lib/active_record/nested_attributes.rb in Active Record in Ruby on Rails 3.1.x and 3.2.x before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not properly implement a certain destroy option, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended change restrictions by leveraging use of the nested attributes feature.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper implementation of the `destroy` option in Active Record's nested attributes feature.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `_destroy` flag in nested attributes prevents the `:reject_if` proc from being called, even if `allow_destroy` is set to false. This allows bypassing intended restrictions on attribute changes.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could set attributes to invalid values, clear attributes, and potentially cause other unintended changes to records.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this by manipulating nested attributes with the `_destroy` flag, bypassing the intended behavior of `:reject_if` procs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers need the ability to manipulate nested attributes. No specific position required, as the vulnerability is exploitable remotely."
