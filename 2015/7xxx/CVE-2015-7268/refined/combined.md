Abstract

Most  enterprises  employ  full-disk-encryption  (FDE)  in  order  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  the  data
stored  on  laptop  drives.  In  the  recent  past,  hardware-based  FDE  solutions  have  gained  increased
popularity. Drives equipped with hardware-based encryption capabilities are called Self-Encrypting Drives
(SED)  and  have  the  advantage  of  offloading  the  encryption  from  the  Operating  System  to  dedicated
hardware in the drive.

In this paper we analyze 4 attack techniques that can be used to gain access to the data of a SED managed
using the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal Storage Specification standards, if the laptop is powered
on or in Sleep Mode. One of these techniques had been previously analyzed for SEDs in the ATA Security
Mode whereas the other 3 are to our knowledge novel techniques introduced by this paper.

Although not all configurations were vulnerable to all of attack techniques, we were able to gain access
to the data on the SED using at least 2 techniques for each configuration tested.

Responsible Disclosure

The issues identified in this paper surround the usage of SED drives with the Opal standard in enterprise
environments. However, these issues are not  due to erroneous or incomplete implementations of the
Opal standard by the various vendors. Instead, they are due to a limitation of the standard that is not well
known within the industry.

We  contacted  TCG  and  disclosed  our  findings  with  them  on  July  15th,  2015.  A  decision  was  taken  by
common agreement that TCG would disseminate the information with all members of the Storage Work
Group. We also involved CERT in the disclosure process and informed them of the exchanges we had with
TCG and the vendors.

Finally, our goal with disclosing these findings is not to facilitate hacking by exploiting the vulnerabilities
we identified. Instead, we are disclosing these issues with the purpose of raising awareness that these
vulnerabilities  exist,  to  allow  for  organizations  to  put  in  place  mitigating  controls  and  for  the  whole
industry to evolve to a more secure state.

1. Introduction

Full Disk Encryption (FDE) is a technique that consists in encrypting the entire contents of a drive in order
to provide data-at-rest protection. Until recently, the most common method of implementing FDE has
been software-based which works by having a software component tied in the Operating System (OS) that
decrypts or encrypts the data prior to it being read or writing to the drive.

An  alternative  to  software-based  FDE  is  to  delegate  the  encryption  logic  to  a  dedicated  hardware
component in the drive. Drives that implement this feature are called Self-Encrypting Drives (SED). One of
the advantages of SEDs is that the encryption is offloaded from the computer Central Processing Unit
(CPU). Although this might not have a significant impact with typical hard-drives where the CPU encryption
speeds  largely  surpass  hard-drives  read/write  speeds,  with  the  advent  of  SSDs  that  have  superior
read/write speeds, having the encryption offloaded to dedicated hardware increases the overall speed of
the drive when encrypted.

One way to control SEDs is through standard Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) Security commands.
Before the existence of SEDs, the ATA Security commands were used to lock and unlock drives by using a
password. Although ATA Security can in theory be used to manage SEDs, it is not wide-spread in enterprise
environments. This is due mostly to the fact that it lacks management features required by enterprise
deployments such as the use of recovery keys and Single Sign-On (SSO) OS based on user accounts.

Another  method  for  controlling  SEDs  is  by  using  the  Trusted  Computing  Group  (TCG)  Opal  Storage
Specification  [1].  The  Opal  standard  provides  a  richer  set  of  features  than  ATA  Security  and  is  most
commonly used in combination with pre-boot authentication software that implements encryption key
management and SSO. The TGC Commonly Asked Questions webpage [2] provides a listing of vendors
that provide Opal compliant drives as well as software management solutions for Opal drives. Although
this  information  appears  to  date  from  2011,  it  demonstrates  the  level  of  industry  acceptance  of  the
standard.

Finally, Microsoft also implements a method for controlling SEDs, called Encrypted Hard Drive or eDrive
[3]. This method is similar to Opal and adds specific requirements for drive manufacturers on top of the
Opal  standard.  In  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we  will  refer  to  this  method  as  belonging  to  the  Opal
security model category, managed by the Microsoft BitLocker in eDrive mode.

This  paper  focuses  on  the  analysis  of  SEDs  when  used  in  the  Opal  mode  with  a  compatible  software
management  solution.  Any  reference  to  SEDs  used  in  the  ATA  Security  mode  will  be  explicitly
distinguished.

2. Related Work

Müller et al. [4] provide a security evaluation of the hardware-based FDE and compare it to software-
based FDE. In particular, they introduce a novel attack technique called “Hot Plug Attack” which involves
switching  the  SATA  data  cable  from  the  original  machine  and  connecting  it  to  an  attacker-controlled
machine. Because the SATA power is maintained while the data cable is switched, the drive remains in an
unlocked state and the data can be read directly from the attacker-controlled machine.

1

Müller et al. also adapt and test known attacks for software-based FDE and provide a decision tree for the
suitable  attack  technique  depending  on  the  computer’s  state.  Although  they  describe  both  the  ATA
Security as well as Opal security models, they only perform tests on SEDs managed with the ATA Security
model.

2.1  Contributions

In this paper we provide the following contributions:

■  Hot Plug Attack: We take the technique introduced by Müller et al. for ATA Security drives and test

it on Opal drives;

■  Forced Restart Attack: We introduce a new technique involving triggering a system crash followed
by booting the machine from an alternative source. We call this technique the Forced Restart
Attack;

■  Hot Unplug Attack: We introduce and test an extension to the Hot Plug Attack technique that

bypasses the eventual protection mechanisms that can be implemented in the laptops, such as the
one implemented in Lenovo laptops for ATA Security drives;

■  Key Capture Attack: We theorize about a technique that would allow for the actual encryption key

to be captured and used for subsequent unlocking of the drive;

■  Recommendations: We provide recommendations both for IT administrators on how to harden Opal

SED deployments as well as for the SED vendors.

3. Attacks
3.1  Setup

The  issues  described  in  this  paper  do  not  affect  specific  drives,  specific  management  software  or  the
laptops and workstations from specific vendors. Instead, to our knowledge, these issues are common to
all Opal SED deployments.

Because  there  are  a  large  number  of  vendors  providing  both  the  drives,  management  software  and
computers  compatible  with  Opal  SED  deployments  it  is  practically  impossible  to  test  every  single
combination  of  these  components.  For  the  purposes  of  our  research,  we  limited  our  testing  to  the
following components:

■  Drives (with originally supplied firmware):

–  Samsung 850 Pro, SSD, 1 TB, P/N MZ7KE1T0
–  Samsung PM851, SSD, 256GB, P/N MZ7TE256HMHP – 000L7
–  Seagate ST500LT015, HDD, 500 GB, P/N 1DJ142-500
–  Seagate ST500LT025, HDD, 500 GB, P/N 1DH142-500

■  Target Computers:

–  Lenovo ThinkPad T440s, BIOS version 2.32
–  Lenovo ThinkPad W541, BIOS version 2.21
–  Dell Latitude E6410, BIOS version A16
–  Dell Latitude E6430, BIOS version A16

■  Management Software:

–  Microsoft BitLocker eDrive, Windows version 8.1 Enterprise, Build 9600
–  Wave EMBASSY Security Center (ESC), version 2.11.1
–  WinMagic SecureDoc, version 6.4.0.117-HF1

In addition, out of the 48 possible combinations of the previously mentioned components, we tested the
following 12:

■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Wave ESC - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6410
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430

For  the  purpose  of  simulating  the  attacker  controlled  computer,  we  used  typical  desktop  and  laptop
computers equipped with a Tableau SATA Forensic Bridge.

3.2  Hot Plug Attack

As described by Müller et al., Hot Plug Attacks rely on the fact that SEDs do not detect when the SATA
data cable is unplugged which allows them to be disconnected from the target machine and connected to
the attacker-controlled machine. Because the power is maintained while the data connection is switched
from  one  machine  to  another,  the  drive  remains  unlocked  and  the  data  is  directly  accessible  on  the
attacker-controlled machine.

On laptops it is not possible to disconnect only the SATA data cable and usually, the entire drive must be
removed  from  the  laptop  thus  disconnecting  both  the  data  and  the  power  connection.  In  order  to
overcome this limitation, the attacker puts the laptop in Sleep Mode and connects SATA extension cables
between  the  drive  and  the  laptop.  Then,  when  the  laptop  is  resumed  from  Sleep  Mode,  the  laptop
automatically  unlocks  the drive  and  at  this  point,  the  SATA  data  cable  can  be  disconnected  while  still
maintaining power to the drive.

Müller et al. found that modern Lenovo laptops detect when drives are unplugged in Sleep Mode and do
not unlock them automatically when waking up from sleep. As mentioned before, these tests and results
are limited to SEDs in the ATA Security mode. Although the scope of this paper is to analyze the security
of SEDs in enterprise environments which use Opal, we validated the scenario described by Müller et al.
on our test Lenovo ThinkPad W541 laptop and confirmed their results - i.e. the laptop detected that the

3

drive was disconnected in Sleep Mode and did not unlock the drive automatically when the laptop was
resumed from Sleep Mode.

When performing the same tests on SEDs in Opal mode, we confirmed that this attack technique remains
valid. Furthermore, we found this attack to be successful even on modern Lenovo laptops when the drive
SEDs are in the Opal mode.

The following configurations tested were found to be vulnerable to this attack:

■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Wave ESC - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6410
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430

None of the configurations tested that had the option of Sleep Mode were found to protect against this
attack.

Note that Sleep Mode might not be the default installation option or even available at all for some SED
management solutions. For example, the standalone Wave EMBASSY Security Center (ESC) 2.11.1 does
not support Sleep Mode at all when used in conjunction with SEDs [5]. On the other hand, Sleep Mode is
supported  in  enterprise  deployments  with  Wave  EMBASSY  Remote  Administration  Server  (ERAS),
however, the ERAS Administration Manual [6] encourage the use of Hibernation instead of Sleep Mode
due  to  the  fact  that  when  using  Sleep  Mode,  the  SED  is  automatically  unlocked  when  the  machine  is
resumed. McCracken [7] also mentions the issues with Sleep Mode and SED on the WinMagic Security
blog and suggests the use of geofencing to move the laptop from Sleep Mode to Hibernation when the
laptop is no longer connected to the corporate network.  Finally, Microsoft [8] mentions that the use of
Hibernation  is  more  secure  than  Sleep  Mode  because  returning  from  Hibernation  requires  BitLocker
authentication,  although  this  recommendation  is  generic  to  BitLocker  and  not  specific  to  BitLocker
eDrives.

3.3  Forced Restart Attack

As described above, after an SED is unlocked, it will remain in that state until it is powered off or explicitly
locked.

4

If an attacker is able to trigger  a soft-reset, the drive  will remain unlocked. The  attacker then has the
option of booting from an alternative source such as CD/DVD, USB or PXE in order to run an OS that the
attacker controls and that reads the data off of the unlocked drive.

Default configurations of Windows automatically restart after a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crash. An
attacker that has physical access to a running Windows machine with an SED and is able to generate a
BSOD will be able to employ this technique.

The following configurations tested were found to be vulnerable to this attack:

■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Wave ESC - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6410
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Samsung PM851 - WinMagic SecureDoc - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Dell Latitude E6430

The following configurations tested were found to be not vulnerable to this attack:

■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Samsung 850 Pro - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad T440s
■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541
■  Seagate ST500LT025 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541

We observed that the two modern Lenovo laptops we tested, ThinkPad W541 and ThinkPad T440s, when
used in conjunction with BitLocker eDrives, would lock the drive whenever the machine restarted. This
occurred both when performing a standard Windows restart as well as when triggering a BSOD crash. This
behavior was  not  observed  on  the  same  Lenovo  laptops  when  used  in  conjunction  with  Wave  ESC  or
WinMagic SecureDoc. In addition, this behavior was not observed on the Dell Latitude E6410 and E6430
laptops  when  used  in  conjunction  with  either  BitLocker  eDrives  or  with  Wave  ESC  and  WinMagic
SecureDoc.

The following sections describe different modes that can be used to trigger a BSOD in Windows.

3.3.1

Facedancer Triggered BSOD

The Facedancer [9] is a device that can be used to fuzz USB drivers. As shown by Schumilo et al. [10], there
are several bugs in the USB driver stack of operating systems that can cause them to crash.

In particular, we confirmed that the following test cases from USB host security assessment tool umap [11]
trigger a BSOD on a Windows 8.1 Enterprise OS fully patched as of July 13th, 2015:

■  03:00:00:C:16
■  03:00:00:C:17

5

■  01:01:00:C:4
■  01:01:00:C:5
■  09:00:00:C:9

3.3.2

USB Hub Chaining Triggered BSOD

In addition to being able to trigger a BSOD sending malformed USB packets, we were able to consistently
crash a fully patched Windows 7 32-bit Enterprise machine using a specific combination of off-the-shelf
hardware: a SteelSeries Kinzu v2 Pro Edition mouse (P/N: 62025) connected to the USB port of a DAS
keyboard (P/N: DASK3ULTMS1SICO) connected to the USB port of a LinksKey 2-port USB KVM Switch (P/N:
LDV-302ARC) connected to the laptop.

Note that we discovered this combination of devices that trigger the Windows BSOD by accident which
shows  that  generating  a  Windows  BSOD  by  having  physical  access  to  a  machine  is  relatively  easy  to
achieve.

3.3.3  Memory Pins Short Triggered BSOD

This method of triggering a BSOD involves tampering with the hardware of the machine. Specifically, we
found that shorting memory pins of a running laptop for a brief period of time can cause a BSOD. In our
testing, we were able to generate a BSOD and have the OS subsequently restart roughly once in every two
attempts,  with  the  other  attempts  resulting  in  an  OS  hang.  We  triggered  this  by  sliding  the  tip  of  a
screwdriver over the pins of a memory module, as illustrated in Figure 1. Note that although in our tests
we did not experience any permanent hardware issues, this technique could have a potentially destructive
effect on the memory module or the motherboard.

Figure 1 - Shorting the pins of a memory module

6

3.3.4

Keyboard Triggered BSOD

Windows has a documented way for triggering BSODs using the keyboard after adding a specific key to
the  Windows  Registry  [12].  This  technique  is  not  a  vulnerability  and  requires  local  administrative
privileged  on  the  machine  to  perform  the  registry  changes.  We  found  this  feature  useful  because  it
allowed us to trigger controlled BSOD and more easily verify the behavior of the SEDs when faced with an
OS crash.

3.4  Hot Unplug Attack

As described in section 3.2, when performing the Hot Plug Attack technique on laptops, the attacker must
first put the laptop in Sleep Mode so that SATA extension cables can be installed. Laptop manufacturers
could put in place mechanisms to detect if a drive is disconnected while the laptop is in Sleep Mode and
prevent  the  drive  from  being  unlocked  automatically  on  resume.  Although  modern  Lenovo  laptops
implement this feature on SEDs in the ATA Security mode, we are not aware of such an implementation
for SEDs in the Opal mode.

At a high-level, this technique involves following operations:

1.  Expose the drive SATA connector pins while the drive is still in the laptop and is powered on;
2.  Supply power to the drive SATA pins from an alternate source;
3.  Break the SATA power and data connections between the drive and the laptop;
4.  Maintain the alternate power source and connect the SATA data to the attacker-controlled

machine.

We attempted two implementations of this technique, one where we taped wires to a plastic card and
placed the card on the SATA power pins and another one that where we exposed the power and data pins
from an actual SATA connector. The first implementation did not produce the expected results and after
several attempts, we ended up accidentally connecting the taped wires to the wrong pins on the drive
which rendered the drive permanently inoperable. The second technique produced the expected results
and consisted of the following:

1.  Expose the drive SATA connector pins while the drive is still in the laptop and is powered on – we
opened the drive cover and removed the drive screw; then, we slightly pulled the drive in the
direction  opposite  to  the  SATA  connector  in  order  to  expose  the  SATA  connector  pins,  as
illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3;

7

Figure 2 – SED in laptop compartment with cover open

Figure 3 – SED in laptop compartment with cover open and SATA pins exposed (shown by arrow)

2.  Supply power to the drive SATA pins from an alternate source – we modified a SATA extension
cable in order to expose the pins, as illustrated in Figure 4; this cable contained both data and
power connectors but at this stage only power was provided at the other end of the extension
cable; we then connected the SATA extension pins to the exposed pins on the drive, as illustrated
in Figure 5;

8

Figure 4 – SATA power and data cable and connector with pins1 exposed

Figure 5 – SATA pins connected to drive while operating

3.  Break the SATA power and data connections between the drive and the laptop – we pulled the
drive from the enclosure until it was completely disconnected from the laptop SATA power and
data connector, while still maintaining the connection with the modified SATA extension cable;
4.  Maintain  the  alternate  power  source  and  connect  the  SATA  data  to  the  attacker-controlled
machine  –  we  connected  the  other  end  of  the  SATA  data  extension  cable  to  the
attacker-controlled machine and we obtained access to the unencrypted data.

1 The top-most SATA data pin was accidentally broken when exposing the pins. Because this pin (1) is connected to GND, role also performed by
pins (4) and (7), this did not have an impact on our experiment.

9

The following configuration was found to be vulnerable to this attack:

■  Seagate ST500LT015 - Microsoft BitLocker eDrive - Lenovo ThinkPad W541

Note that this technique is similar to the Hot Plug Attack with the difference that it does not require the
laptop to be put in Sleep Mode. Consequently, we expect this technique to work on at least all of the
configurations that are vulnerable to the Hot Plug Attack as well as to bypass any protection mechanisms
that could be implemented in the laptops that would detect and lock drives being disconnected while in
Sleep Mode.

3.5  Key Capture Attack

This technique consists in capturing the actual cryptographic keys being sent to the drives to unlock them.

One implementation of this attack technique consists of updating the firmware of an attacker-controlled
drive in order to masquerade as a legitimate Opal drive and to capture and store encryption keys. Then,
the target machine is put in Sleep Mode and the original drive is replaced with the tampered drive. When
the  machine  is  resumed  from  Sleep  Mode,  the  unlock  command  and  decryption  key  is  sent  to  the
tampered hard drive which records it. Then this key is used to unlock the original drive without other
restrictions on an attacker controlled machine.

An alternative implementation of this technique consists of connecting a SATA sniffer to the SATA data
cable  to  capture  and  decode  the  authentication  commands  containing  the  decryption  key  while  the
original drive is being unlocked, for example, when the machine is resumed from Sleep Mode.

Note that we only theorize about the Key Capture Attack and that we did not actually implement or test
it. However, this technique could be used to bypass eventual protection measures in the drives that would
detect when the SATA data connection of a drive is interrupted and moved to another machine.

4. Recommendations

This section describes the various corrective or compensatory measures that can be put in place to limit
the risk that the SED attacks described in this paper pose.

4.1  Recommendations for Enterprises

Enterprises that have currently deployed SEDs may attempt to harden their deployments. In particular
the following compensatory measures should be taken into consideration:

■  Disabling Sleep Mode: If the availability of Sleep Mode is not required, we recommend disabling this
feature in order to prevent against Hot Plug attacks on laptops. Alternatively, some management
solutions allow for setting temporal or geographical limitation on the use of Sleep Mode;

■  Disabling the restart on BSOD: If the Windows Automatically restart feature is not activated, an

attacker that has the ability to crash a machine with a BSOD will not be able to boot the machine
from an alternative media. This workaround addresses the Forced Restart Attack technique;

■  Prevent booting from alternative sources: If the BIOS is locked down to prevent a user from booting
for any other device than the main drive, an attacker that is able to trigger a restart would not be

10

able to boot from an attacker-controlled OS and read the data.  This workaround addresses the
Forced Restart Attack technique.

4.2  Recommendations for SED Manufacturers

SED manufacturers should consider implementing a feature in the drives that detects when the SATA data
connection is lost and locks the drive at that point. This recommendation mitigates the Hot Plug and Hot
Unplug Attacks.

4.3  Recommendations for SED Management Software Providers

SED Management Software Providers should discourage or disable the use of the Sleep mode as well as
the Automatically restart Windows feature, similarly to our recommendations in section 4.1. Note that
some SED management solutions already implement this recommendation to a certain extent.

4.4  Recommendations for Laptop Manufacturers

Laptop  manufacturers  should  consider  detecting  when  Opal  managed  SEDs  are  disconnected  in  Sleep
Mode and disabling the automatic unlocking of these drives when they are plugged back. Because the
unlocking is performed by the SED management software and not directly by the laptop BIOS or UEFI, this
recommendation is not straightforward to implement. One way in which this could be achieved would be
for the laptop to require a full power off and power back on when such an event is detected.

In addition, laptop manufacturers should consider providing configuration options in the BIOS or the UEFI
that would lock the SED when the system is being reset, for example, after a Windows BSOD. According
to the testing that we performed, eDrive managed SED have this behavior which mitigates the Forced
Restart Attack.

Finally, laptop manufactures should consider providing laptop with tamper detection mechanisms that,
for example, would power off the laptop if the drive cover is tampered with, if configured to do so.

4.5  Recommendations for OS Developers

Operating  System  developers  should  reconsider  the  implications  of  bugs  or  vulnerabilities  in  their
software that allow an attacker with physical access to the machine to trigger a system crash generating
a soft-reset. As shown in this paper, in the context of SEDs, such a system crash may give an attacker
access to clear text data on a SED.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we introduce 3 novel attack techniques for gaining access to the data on SEDs in the Opal
security  mode,  namely  the  Forced  Restart  Attack,  Hot  Unplug  Attack,  and  Key  Capture  Attack.
These techniques, as well as the Hot Plug Attack previously used to gain access to SEDs in the ATA Security
mode, all require an attacker to have physical access to a laptop that is powered or in Sleep Mode.

11

We tested the Hot Plug Attack, Forced Restart Attack and Hot Unplug Attack on various configurations
with Seagate and Samsung drivers of different models, on Lenovo and Dell laptops of different models
and in conjunction with WinMagic, Wave and Microsoft SED management software.

We found all tested configurations to be vulnerable to the 3 attack techniques, with the exception of the
Lenovo laptops when used in conjunction with the Microsoft BitLocker eDrive SED management software.
In  this  specific  case,  the  Force  Restart  Attack  was  unsuccessful  regardless  of  the  drive  being  used,
however, the other two techniques, the Hot Plug Attack and Hot Unplug Attack were successful and did
allow us to bypass the SED data encryption.

We recommend that enterprise deployments of SEDs consider disabling Sleep Mode, preventing Windows
to  automatically  restart  following  a  crash  and  locking  down  the  BIOS  or  UEFI.  We  also  provide
recommendations for the other industry actors involved in SED solutions, such as, SED manufacturers,
SED management software providers and OS developers.
