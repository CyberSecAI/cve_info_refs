The provided document details multiple attack techniques against Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) managed using the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal Storage Specification, focusing on scenarios where the laptop is powered on or in sleep mode. This information is relevant to CVE-2015-7268 as it exposes vulnerabilities in the implementation and usage of SEDs, although the CVE description is a placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue stems from a limitation in the TCG Opal standard regarding the drive's unlocked state persistence after power is maintained and the lack of proper detection of drive disconnections. Once an SED is unlocked, it remains unlocked until powered off or explicitly locked, regardless of whether it is still connected to the original system or a new one. Additionally, vulnerabilities in software/OS that can lead to system crashes further exacerbate the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of disconnection detection:** SEDs do not detect when the SATA data cable is unplugged while powered on, which is key for the hot plug and hot unplug attacks.
*   **Unlocked state persistence:** SEDs remain unlocked after the initial unlock until explicitly locked or powered off.
*   **Vulnerability to soft resets/crashes:** An attacker can cause a system crash that leads to a reboot, leaving the drive in an unlocked state.
*   **Sleep mode vulnerability:** When resuming from sleep mode, the drives unlock automatically.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the data on the SED by exploiting these vulnerabilities. This can lead to data breaches, loss of confidentiality, and other security incidents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hot Plug Attack:**
    1.  The laptop is put into sleep mode.
    2.  SATA extension cables are used to connect the drive.
    3.  The laptop resumes from sleep mode, unlocking the drive.
    4.  The SATA data cable is switched to an attacker-controlled machine.
*   **Forced Restart Attack:**
    1.  The attacker triggers a system crash (BSOD).
    2.  The system automatically restarts, leaving the drive unlocked.
    3.  The attacker boots from an alternative source (USB, CD/DVD) to access data.
    4.  The attacker gains access to the unlocked drive and its data.
*  **Hot Unplug Attack:**
    1.  Expose SATA connector pins of the powered-on drive.
    2.  Provide power to the drive's SATA pins from an external source.
    3.  Break the SATA connections between the drive and the laptop.
    4.  Connect the SATA data cable to an attacker-controlled machine.
*   **Key Capture Attack (Theoretical):**
    1.  Use a tampered drive or a SATA sniffer to capture the encryption keys being sent to the drive.
    2.  Use the captured key to unlock the drive on an attacker-controlled machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access** to the target laptop.
*   Ability to put the machine in sleep mode and connect SATA extension cables (Hot Plug Attack).
*   Ability to trigger a system crash (Forced Restart Attack) which can be done by:
    *   Fuzzing USB drivers (using Facedancer device)
    *   Using specific USB device combinations
    *   Tampering with hardware (shorting memory pins)
*   Ability to physically manipulate the drive and SATA connections (Hot Unplug Attack).
* Ability to perform advanced hardware/firmware manipulation or data capturing (Key Capture Attack).

**Additional Information:**

*   The document provides details on specific hardware and software configurations tested.
*   It offers recommendations for enterprises, SED manufacturers, SED management software providers, laptop manufacturers, and OS developers.
