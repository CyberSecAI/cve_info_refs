Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7474:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of user-supplied input within IBM Jazz Foundation and IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability due to the lack of proper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page.
- When a victim views the page, the injected script executes within their web browser, under the security context of the hosting website.
- The attacker could potentially steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials, gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input through a field on the affected web application.
- An attacker injects malicious code into this field.
- When another user views the page containing this injected code, the script will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to a vulnerable field within the application.
-  The attacker needs to be able to persuade a victim to view a page containing the injected script.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple IBM Rational products built on IBM Jazz technology including Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM).
- The provided CVSS vector `(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)` indicates the vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), has a low attack complexity (AC:L), requires low privileges (PR:L), requires user interaction (UI:R), has a changed scope (S:C), with low confidentiality impact (C:L), low integrity impact (I:L), and no availability impact (A:N).
