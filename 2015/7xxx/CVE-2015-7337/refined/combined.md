# IPython: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201512-02**

A vulnerability in IPython could result in execution of arbitrary
JavaScript.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-python/ipython** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.1-r1** |

### Background

IPython is an advanced interactive shell for Python.

### Description

IPython does not properly check the MIME type of a file.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted text
file using IPython, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary
JavaScript with the privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IPython users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/ipython-3.2.1-r1"

```

```
Email address of requester: security () ipython org, benjaminrk () gmail com,
rgbkrk () gmail com, jkamens () quantopian com, ssanderson () quantopian com

Software name: IPython notebook / Jupyter notebook
Type of vulnerability: Maliciously forged file
Attack outcome: Possible remote execution

Vulnerability: A maliciously forged file opened for editing can execute
javascript, specifically by being redirected to /files/ due to a failure to
treat the file as plain text.

Affected versions:

- notebook 4.0 ≤ 4.0.4

URI with issues:

- GET /edit/**

Patches:

- IPython 3.x: 0a8096adf165e2465550bd5893d7e352544e5967 (
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/0a8096adf165e2465550bd5893d7e352544e5967>
)
- Jupyter 4.0.x: 9e63dd89b603dfbe3a7e774d8a962ee0fa30c0b5 (
<https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/commit/9e63dd89b603dfbe3a7e774d8a962ee0fa30c0b5>
)

Mitigations:

Upgrade to IPython/Jupyter notebook 4.0.5, 4.1 or 3.2.2 once available.
If using pip,

    pip install --upgrade "ipython[notebook]<4.0"  # for 3.2.2
    pip install --upgrade notebook # for 4.1 or 4.0.5

For conda:

    conda update conda
