- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the MongoDB Enterprise versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 when using LDAP authentication. The specific mechanism within LDAP authentication that is vulnerable is not detailed in this document, however it is associated with the PLAIN authentication mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authentication bypass vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to the MongoDB instance or cluster.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the MongoDB instance or cluster.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the LDAP authentication mechanism, specifically when the PLAIN authentication mechanism is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to target a MongoDB Enterprise instance running vulnerable versions (3.0.0-3.0.6) with LDAP authentication enabled. They also must be able to interact with the authentication mechanism to exploit the vulnerability.
