### Description

**Issue Status as of Dec 02, 2015**

**ISSUE SUMMARY**

A vulnerability in MongoDB Enterprise 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 may allow a user to gain unauthorized access to a MongoDB instance or cluster. **Only deployments using LDAP authentication are affected by this vulnerability**.

This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2015-7882](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-7882).

To determine if your deployment is affected, run the following command on any node in your cluster:

```
db.adminCommand({getParameter: 1, authenticationMechanisms: 1})

```

If the output contains the word “PLAIN” then your installation is vulnerable. The following example shows the output of the above command in a vulnerable installation:

```
> db.adminCommand({getParameter: 1, authenticationMechanisms: 1})
{ "authenticationMechanisms" : [ "PLAIN" ], "ok" : 1 }

```

**USER IMPACT**

It is possible to gain unauthorized access to an instance or cluster running an affected version of MongoDB Enterprise with LDAP authentication enabled. **The Community edition of MongoDB is not affected by this vulnerability.**

**WORKAROUNDS**

There are no workarounds for this issue. Impacted users must upgrade to MongoDB 3.0.7 as soon as possible.

**AFFECTED VERSIONS**

MongoDB Enterprise 3.0.0 through 3.0.6 (inclusive).

**FIX VERSION**

The fix is included in the 3.0.7 production release.
