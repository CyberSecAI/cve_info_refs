Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The driver for Digi Neo and ClassicBoard devices (dgnc) in the Linux kernel does not properly initialize data structures, specifically the `digi_dinfo` structure in `dgnc_mgmt_ioctl()`. The 16 reserved bytes of this structure after the `dinfo_nboards` member are not initialized, which leads to an information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: The driver fails to initialize reserved bytes within a data structure which can result in the exposure of sensitive kernel memory contents to user-space.
- Lack of Proper Initialization: The `dgnc_mgmt_ioctl` function does not zero out the entire `digi_dinfo` structure before populating its members.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information from the kernel can be obtained by a local attacker. This could include kernel addresses, data structures, or other potentially sensitive data.
- The vulnerability by itself doesn't lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, but the information leaked could aid in such attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: An attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- `ioctl()` call: The attacker would need to invoke the `ioctl()` system call on a `/dev/` node associated with the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user: An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- Privileges: The attacker needs the ability to interact with the `/dev/` node associated with the affected driver to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix is to add `memset(&ddi, 0, sizeof(ddi));` before filling the structure to avoid the info leak, as shown in the provided git commit.
- This vulnerability is present in the staging driver `dgnc`, which may or may not be enabled in various distributions.
- Red Hat considers this issue to not affect their RHEL products as the affected code isn't present in the kernels they ship.
- Multiple Ubuntu Security Notices address this vulnerability in various kernel versions/flavors.
