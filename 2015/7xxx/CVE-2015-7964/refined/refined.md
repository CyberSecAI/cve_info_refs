Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to certain subdirectories and executable modules during the installation of SafeNet Authentication Service agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The core issue is that the installation process sets overly permissive ACLs on agent directories and executables.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Authenticated users, even those with limited privileges (including guests), are granted excessive control (full control/modify/write permissions) over agent files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with a low-privilege account can modify or replace legitimate agent executable files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** When a high-privilege user (e.g., an administrator) executes a compromised module, the attacker gains the same privileges as that user. This allows an attacker to gain full access to the compromised host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where the vulnerable SafeNet Authentication Service agent is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the system, even a low-privilege or guest account.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the file system of the affected server or workstation where the SafeNet agent is installed.

**Specific Information Regarding CVE-2015-7964:**

*   The content explicitly lists "SafeNet Authentication Service for NPS Agent" as a product affected by CVE-2015-7964.
*   It also provides a mitigation for this specific vulnerability through a maintenance release (DOW4117) and also a manual mitigation process that includes changes to the file permissions of the installation directory.
