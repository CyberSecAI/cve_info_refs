Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in Cybozu Office. Specifically, the vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input within various functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided input before it's displayed within the application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's pages. The affected areas include:
    - Search functionality
    - Email functionality in Internet Explorer
    - Specific screens that handle data from address books
    - File management features
    - Some start menu functionalities
    - Several other specific screens or parameters which are not fully specified
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    -  Hijacking user sessions
    -  Data theft or manipulation
    -  Defacement of the application
    -  Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- The attacker can trigger actions on behalf of the user, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data or triggering unintended actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is network-based, and is delivered by injecting malicious code into vulnerable input fields or parameters that are part of HTTP requests.
-  The attack requires user interaction, where a user must be tricked into visiting a crafted URL or interacting with a manipulated web page.
- The specific methods of injection may vary depending on the vulnerable function, but typically involve crafting malicious input that's not properly sanitized by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or manipulate web pages to include the malicious script.
- The attacker must also be able to lure the victim into accessing the malicious code or crafted links or pages.
- No authentication is required to inject malicious scripts, however a successful exploit does require an authenticated user to be logged in and interacting with the vulnerable content.
- The attacker does not need access to the internal network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities were found within Cybozu Office which are being tracked by different CVEs (CVE-2015-7795, CVE-2015-7796, CVE-2015-7797, CVE-2015-7798, CVE-2016-1149 and CVE-2016-1150). This indicates a widespread issue with input validation across the software.
