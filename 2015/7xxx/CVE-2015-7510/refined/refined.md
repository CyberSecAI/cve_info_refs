{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2015-7510",
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the getpwnam and getgrnam functions of the NSS module nss-mymachines in systemd.",
    "root_cause": "The `getpwnam` and `getgrnam` implementations in `nss_mymachines` have stack overflows due to an unconstrained `alloca` call (hidden behind `strndupa`).",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Unconstrained alloca call"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted machine name can cause a stack overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted, overlong machine name. The vulnerability is triggered by calls to `getpwnam` or `getgrnam` with this crafted name."
