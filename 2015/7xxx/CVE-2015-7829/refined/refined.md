Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7829:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of junction points within Adobe Reader. A junction point is a symbolic link to a directory on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can manipulate junction points within the sandboxed Adobe Reader environment to cause the deletion of files accessible to the user running the sandboxed process. This is achieved through the Adobe Collaboration Sync function which deletes the contents of the linked directory.
- **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the restrictions of the Adobe Reader sandbox to delete arbitrary files as a normal user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to delete files on the affected system. This could lead to:
  - Data loss or corruption if important user data or system files are deleted.
  - Denial of service by deleting essential application or system components making them unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the context of an Adobe Reader sandboxed process.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The victim must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file designed to trigger the vulnerability, likely a specially crafted PDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker must have some local code execution capability within the user's session, specifically within the sandboxed Adobe Reader process.
- **Knowledge of Junction Points:** The attacker needs a good understanding of how junction points work within Windows and how to manipulate them to achieve arbitrary file deletion using the Adobe Collaboration Sync.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri and Jasiel Spelman of HP Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe addressed this vulnerability in a security update.
- The provided Adobe security bulletin (APSB15-24) also mentions CVE-2015-7829, noting it was resolved via a security fix in Windows.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 1.9, indicating a low severity due to the Local attack vector and Medium attack complexity.
