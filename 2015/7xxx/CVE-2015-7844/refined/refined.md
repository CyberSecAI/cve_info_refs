- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input verification in the handling of the HDP protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system does not properly validate the HDP protocol packets, allowing the injection of malformed data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the virtual cloud desktop to display errors and become unusable.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have network access to the FusionAccess system to inject malformed HDP protocol packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the FusionAccess network and the ability to craft and send malformed HDP protocol packets.
