{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2015-7701",
    "description": "A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "net-misc/ntp versions < 4.2.8_p8",
       "ntp versions before 4.2.8p4"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The ntpd process allocates memory for incoming extensions with an ASSOC Autokey message but fails to free the memory before a subsequent assignment. Specifically, when processing a symmetric active NTPv4 packet with multiple CRYPTO_ASSOC extensions, the `peer->cmmd` memory is overwritten with new allocated memory for each successive extension, resulting in a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak",
	  "Improper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exhaust the server's memory leading to a Denial of Service.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends crafted NTP packets with multiple CRYPTO_ASSOC extensions to a vulnerable ntpd instance that is configured to use autokey authentication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target server. They also need knowledge that the target ntpd is configured to use autokey authentication.",
	"additional_details": "The memory leak occurs when processing symmetric active NTPv4 packets with multiple Autokey extensions. The ntpd process allocates memory for each CRYPTO_ASSOC extension but does not free the memory before processing the next one, causing a leak. This can take days to exhaust server memory due to the maximum extension size limit imposed by ntpd.",
     "mitigation": "Disable NTP autokey authentication by removing or commenting out all configuration directives beginning with the `crypto` keyword in the `ntp.conf` file. Upgrade to ntp version 4.2.8p4 or later. Monitor ntpd instances."
