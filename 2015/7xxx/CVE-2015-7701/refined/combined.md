#### Description

If `ntpd` is configured to use autokey, then an attacker can send packets to `ntpd` that will, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory.

---

#### Mitigation

* Don’t use autokey.
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

---

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Tenable Network Security.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2583)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time. (CVE-2015-7979)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-5196, CVE-2015-7703)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A). (CVE-2015-7974)
* A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client processed certain incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. (CVE-2015-8158)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1274255#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 11:29:12 UTC  ``` A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory.  Mitigation:  Disable NTP autokey authentication by removing, or commenting out, all configuration directives beginning with the 'crypto' keyword in your ntp.conf file.

## Synopsis

Moderate: ntp security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0780)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-7703)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).

The only generally-exploitable bug in the above list is the crypto-NAK bug, which has a CVSS2 score of 6.4.

Additionally, three bugs that have already been fixed in ntp-4.2.8 but were not fixed in ntp-4.2.6 as it was EOL’d have a security component, but are all below 1.8 CVSS score, so we’re reporting them here:

* [2382: Peer precision < -31 gives division by zero](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug2382/)
* [1774: Segfaults if cryptostats enabled when built without OpenSSL](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1774/)
* [1593: ntpd abort in free() with logconfig syntax error](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1593/)

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2015-09-28 09:34:41 UTC  ``` The bug: ------------------------------------------------------------ ntpd processes symmetric active NTPv4 packets with multiple extensions. This can cause memory leak as shown below:  int crypto_recv(...) { ...   // loop to process (multiple) extensions         while ((has_mac = rbufp->recv_length - authlen) > (int)MAX_MAC_LEN) { ...                 case CRYPTO_ASSOC:                          /*                          * If our state machine is running when this                          * message arrives, the other fellow might have                          * restarted. However, this could be an                          * intruder, so just clamp the poll interval and                          * find out for ourselves. Otherwise, pass the                          * extension field to the transmit side.                          */                         if (peer->crypto & CRYPTO_FLAG_CERT) {                                 rval = XEVNT_ERR;                                 break;                         }                         if (peer->cmmd) {                                 if (peer->assoc != associd) {                                         rval = XEVNT_ERR;                                         break;                                 }                         }                         fp = emalloc(len);                         memcpy(fp, ep, len);                         fp->associd = htonl(peer->associd);                         peer->cmmd = fp; ... }  Here when processing an extension with an ASSOC Autokey message in it, ntpd allocates and copies memory for the incoming extension and assigns it to peer->cmmd. However, when mulitple ASSOC messages are present in a symmetric active NTPv4 packet, memory pointed by peer->cmmd was not freed prior to the peer->cmmd = fp assignment. This causes a memory leak, which could lead to a DoS.  PoC: ------------------------------------------------------------ This PoC tries to cause memory leak in ntpd.  Target setup and conditions: - Target ntpd has Autokey (crypto) enabled. - Host running this script and the target host must not go through   Network Address Translation. - Run this script repeatly with watch -n 1 python ntp_mem_leak.py <target_ip> - Note that since ntpd limits maximum extension size to 2048 bytes, it   can take a long time (days) to exhaust ntpd memory. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2015-09-28 09:36:49 UTC  ``` What earlier versions are affected by this bug?  Does it make any difference that today, well-formed NTP packets will never (as I recall) contain multiple extension fields? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c2)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-28 15:39:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c1)) > What earlier versions are affected by this bug? >  > Does it make any difference that today, well-formed NTP packets will never (as > I recall) contain multiple extension fields?  The reference implementation today only supports one extension field - Autokey - and cannot support more that one at this time. This will be changing very soon. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c3)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-09-28 16:38:28 UTC  ``` Added the missing call to 'free()' before storing the buffered item.

From my previous mails:  After the release, it appears we have an extraneous CVE assignment. I went back through the mails and think I figured out why. From Harlan's mail on 2015-10-10:  CVE-2014-9297 - Do not use this number CVE-2015-7702 CVE-2015-7691 	NtpBug2899, NtpBug2671  	Incorrect patch for NtpBug2671, CVE-2014-9297 in crypto_xmit()  CVE-2015-7702 CVE-2015-7692 	NtpBug2899, NtpBug2671 	Missing length check for vallen in crypto_bob2() 	Missing length checks for autokey with GQ identity scheme   CVE-2015-7701 	NtpBug2909 	Slow memory leak in CRYPTO_ASSOC  ^ Now that I see everything public, I really should have caught this earlier and brought it up. CVE-2015-7702 is being assigned to two separate issues, on top of the unique assignments (7691 and 7692). In a follow-up mail, CVE said:  We believe that you (or anyone else) should be able to use unique CVE IDs according to <http://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/cd_abstraction.html> documentation such as "If S1 and S2 are the same type of bug, but S1 appears in some version that S2 does not (or vice versa), then SPLIT." The maintainers of NTP have an alternative perspective. We continue to work with them to ensure the expected outcome of CVE-2015-7701 and CVE-2015-7702.  Based on the publication today, this is not the case. The bugs are in the same versions and fixed by the same new version, meaning they would not be abstracted.  As far as I can tell, CVE-2015-7701, CVE-2015-7691, and CVE-2015-7692 are valid assignments that track to unique issues that follow CVE's abstraction rules. CVE-2015-7702 seems to be a second duplicate assignment, that covers 7691/7692. The only way I see this not being true is if 7702 was assigned specifically for the crypto_bob2() function, and 7692 was assigned for the crypto_bob3() and cert_sign() functions in my original report. However, the breakdown above does not specify that, or explain why that was abstracted if so. Further, if that is the case, it doesn't explain why it is listed above that related to 7691.  I am publishing the Tenable advisory with the 3 valid assignments that I see, and not mentioning 7702 until I get clarification from you guys. I believe that 7692 should be assigned for all three functions, and 7702 should be REJECTED as a duplicate. If there is a technical reason to abstract them, then either NTP or Tenable needs to explain that in one of the advisories (which I am happy to do, but don't understand that reason).  .b ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c9)  Tenable    2015-11-17 03:14:40 UTC  ```  This is still outstanding. As you mentioned, please take this to email by responding to my previous queries.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c10)  Sathish    2015-12-29 09:25:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=2909#c0))  can you please give the script "ntp_mem_leak.py" . am not able to find the script. i have to test this mem leak    > The bug: > ------------------------------------------------------------ > ntpd processes symmetric active NTPv4 packets with multiple > extensions.
