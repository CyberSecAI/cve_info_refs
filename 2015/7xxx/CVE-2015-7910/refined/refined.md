- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Exemys Telemetry Web Server allows an attacker to bypass authentication by ignoring the location header, granting direct access to information without proper login.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass, CWE-592: Authentication Bypass Issues. The server fails to properly enforce authentication, allowing access without credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the server without proper login credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and control of the SCADA system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skill is able to exploit this vulnerability. No specific privileges or prior authentication is needed as the authentication mechanism is bypassed.
