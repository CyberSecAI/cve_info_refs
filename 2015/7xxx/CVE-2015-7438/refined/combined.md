## Error description

* ```
  Environment Info
  IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2.5
  Microsoft SQL Server 2008 10.00.1600
  Linux 3.0.101-0.46-default

  Problem Statement
  Security Token password stored in clear text in database.

  According to the documentation:
  [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JSW_5.2.0/com.i
  bm.help.web_services.doc/SI_Create_Username_ScrtyTkn.html](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3JSW_5.2.0/com.ibm.help.web_services.doc/SI_Create_Username_ScrtyTkn.html)
  when you set a security token to digest, the password is hashed
  for storage and for sending.

  However, it looks like the password is stored in plain text in
  the database regardless of the setting. To test, create two
  security tokens, one with digest and one without. Then do a
  select on SECURITY_TOKEN_PAR.  You will see both passwords in
  plain text.  One is marked as digest, the other not.

  Simulation Steps
  1) Go to Deployment > Web Services > Security Tokens.
  2) Create 2 security tokens.  On the Create UserName Token
  screen select Use Digest for one and don't select it for the
  other.
  3) Run the query:  SELECT * FROM SECURITY_TOKEN_PAR
  4) Observe that the password for each of the tokens is stored
  in clear text.

  TOKEN_NAME     TOKEN_VERSION     NAME     VALUE
     JPMTEST1    1    DIGEST    false
     JPMTEST1    1    PASSWORD    123456789
     JPMTEST1    1    USERNAME    foo
     JPMTEST2    1    DIGEST    true
     JPMTEST2    1    PASSWORD    123456789
     JPMTEST2    1    USERNAME    foo2
