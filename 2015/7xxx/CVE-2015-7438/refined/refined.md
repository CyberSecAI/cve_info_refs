- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sterling B2B Integrator was storing security token passwords in clear text in the database, despite the documentation stating that passwords should be hashed when using the digest option.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is the storage of sensitive password data in plain text within the database, violating the principle of least privilege and secure data handling. This affects the confidentiality of the credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with unauthorized access to the database could retrieve the clear text passwords, potentially gaining access to other systems and resources protected by these credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need access to the database where the Sterling B2B Integrator stores its data to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs privileged access to the database, likely gained by compromising the system hosting the database or exploiting another vulnerability that leads to database access.
