Worked exactly as expected, had it serving ads on all my blogs and certain sidebars within 15 minutes of download (Of course I already had the ads created!)

### [Simple but complete ‚Äì the best Ad banner rotator!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-but-complete-the-best-ad-banner-rotator/)

In my view, currently the best ad banner rotator for wordpress! I like it completeness to configure banners (images or html/js code) and defining the ad-spots. Due to its simple concept its really handy ‚Äì and the best: its free üòâ
it works well with the latest WordPress version 4.9.2!

This is the best plugin for adding rotating banners to your site. I‚Äôve tested at least 5 other plugins and this one has bested them all with the simplicity and useful features.
