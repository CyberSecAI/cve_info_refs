This plugin USED to work great. It appears obsolete now. No map displays anymore. Was great. A dud now.

This is a great and simple plugin to drop and customize pins on a Google map. It’s intuitive and easy to setup. That being said it does need some responsive tweaks and the API key process is god awful annoying but the API issue it not strictly the plugin’s fault. I would still recommend this plugin.
