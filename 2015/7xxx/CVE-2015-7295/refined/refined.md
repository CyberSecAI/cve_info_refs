Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Virtual Network Device (virtio-net) support in QEMU. Specifically, it occurs when the emulator receives large network packets, particularly when the guest's virtio-net driver does not support big or mergeable receive buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Handling of Large Packets:** The QEMU emulator doesn't properly handle large network packets, particularly when the guest's network driver is not configured to handle them by using mergeable buffers.
- **Descriptor Leak:** When packets are truncated during reception, the emulator doesn't discard the used descriptors and doesn't signal they have been used, leading to a leak of scatter/gather (sg) mappings.
- **Receive Stall:** The issue with descriptor handling results in a stall of the receive functionality if a large number of packets were truncated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker on the local network can exploit this flaw to disable the guest's network by sending a large number of jumbo frames to the guest.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The attack leads to the exhaustion of the guest's receive buffers.
- **Loss of Network Connectivity:** The guest's network functionality is effectively disabled, rendering it unable to communicate over the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the guest virtual machine.
- **Malicious Network Traffic:** The attack is conducted by sending a large number of jumbo frames to the guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the same network as the vulnerable QEMU guest.
- **Ability to Send Network Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets, specifically jumbo frames, to the guest machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the guest's virtio-net driver does not support big or mergeable receive buffers, meaning certain configurations are more vulnerable than others.
- The issue results in descriptor leaks and receive stalls, ultimately leading to the denial of service.
- The provided patches resolve the issue by discarding used descriptors in cases where packets are truncated.
