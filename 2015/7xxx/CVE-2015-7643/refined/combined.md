Quoting from the APSB15-28:  These updates resolve a type confusion vulnerability that could lead to code execution ([CVE-2015-7659](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7659)).  These updates resolve a security bypass vulnerability that could be exploited to write arbitrary data to the file system under user permissions ([CVE-2015-7662](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7662)).

Up-to-now there is no fixed package. This has been for each flash-player security update up-to-now.

I don't think that waiting for the Tumbleweed rolling is an adequate security strategy. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=946880#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2015-09-28 09:53:54 UTC  ``` there is one now.   tumbleweed non oss publishes only when tumbleweed oss publishes.
