- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User and admin passwords are stored in a way that is easily decrypted in the `setenv.sh` and `parameter.txt` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure storage of sensitive information (passwords). The passwords can be easily decrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the system by decrypting the stored passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the file system where the vulnerable `setenv.sh` and `parameter.txt` files are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the file system where the vulnerable files are stored, and the ability to decrypt the passwords using the known method.
