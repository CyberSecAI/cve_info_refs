That's one option. I was actually thinking that an attacker could also
exploit this issue to extract information from ldap - provided that the
attacker knows a working username and password combination then they should
be able craft ldap queries that only match their username if an additional
search condition is met.

Use CVE-2015-7294.

The existence of a fork does not, by itself, lead to use of multiple CVE IDs.
The CVE ID is for the vulnerability in the shared codebase, regardless of the
product names in which that codebase is used.

<https://github.com/vesse/node-ldapauth-fork/issues/21#issuecomment-108186158>
has comments from the vendor about possible mitigating factors. Given
those comments, is the most straightforward threat that the attacker
may be able to arrange for a search result to be exactly one username,
and may not know the complete username in advance but may know the
password in advance?

## Description

[![@jtblin](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388974?v=4&size=48)](/jtblin)[jtblin](https://github.com/jtblin)opened [on May 22, 2015](https://github.com/vesse/node-ldapauth-fork/issues/21#issue-79244764)

The username is not filtered as per ldap specifications so the code seems to be vulnerable to ldap injection: <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection>
