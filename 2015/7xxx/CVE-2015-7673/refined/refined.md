{
  "CVE-2015-7673": {
    "description": "io-tga.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.0 uses heap memory after its allocation failed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Truevision TGA (TARGA) file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because `gdk-pixbuf` uses heap memory after an allocation failure when processing TGA files, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Use-after-free due to failed allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could result in a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user or an automated system to open a specially crafted TGA image file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious TGA image file and trick a user or system into processing this file."

  "CVE-2015-7674": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the pixops_scale_nearest function in pixops/pixops.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow during the scaling of GIF images, specifically within the `pixops_scale_nearest` function, leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",

      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation may lead to a denial of service (application crash) and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by tricking a user or an automated system into opening a specially crafted GIF image file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious GIF image file and make the target process it."
