- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the way WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus handle incoming HTTP requests, which allows an attacker to identify the underlying technology.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability, which reveals the technology stack used by the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use the information about the technology stack to search for and exploit other known vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be an external user capable of sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable service.
