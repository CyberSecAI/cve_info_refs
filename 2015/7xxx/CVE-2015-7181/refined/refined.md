RELATED: CVE-2015-7181

Summary: The provided documents discuss CVE-2015-7181, a use-after-poison vulnerability in the ASN.1 decoder of Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). This vulnerability, along with several other related issues, is fixed in various software releases.

Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a flaw in how NSS's ASN.1 decoder handles crafted OCTET STRING data, leading to a use-after-poison condition. The issue stems from an improper restriction on access to an unspecified data structure during parsing.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use-after-poison condition in `sec_asn1d_parse_leaf()`.
- Improper handling of crafted OCTET STRING data during ASN.1 DER parsing.
- Inadequate restriction on access to data structures during parsing.
- Memory corruption

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (application crash).
- Potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the vulnerable software.
- Possible compromise of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources

Attack vectors:
- Remote attackers can trigger this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted web page or email.
- Crafted OCTET STRING data in ASN.1 DER format sent over the network.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send crafted data to the vulnerable system.
- No authentication is required for remote exploitation in some cases.

Additional Notes:
- This vulnerability affects multiple products including Firefox, Thunderbird, and Oracle VM Server for x86
- Multiple related CVEs are often resolved simultaneously as they have similar root causes, such as: CVE-2015-4000, CVE-2015-7182, CVE-2015-7183, CVE-2016-1938, CVE-2016-1950, CVE-2016-1978, CVE-2016-1979, and CVE-2016-2834.
- The vulnerability exists in both client-side and server-side implementations of NSS.
- Patches for this vulnerability are often cumulative, including fixes for other related vulnerabilities.
- Oracle's analysis of each security vulnerability does not disclose full details of the analysis but does provide the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit.
- Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible due to reported attempts at exploitation.
