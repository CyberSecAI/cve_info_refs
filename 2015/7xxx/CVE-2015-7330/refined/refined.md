- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfiguration in Puppet Enterprise 2015.3 allowed non-whitelisted hosts to communicate over the Puppet communications protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically allowing unauthorized hosts to interact with the Puppet system.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially control Puppet instances due to the ability to communicate using the Puppet protocol from non-whitelisted hosts.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where an attacker would attempt to communicate with the Puppet system from a non-whitelisted host.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Puppet system and be able to craft messages that conform to the Puppet communication protocol.
