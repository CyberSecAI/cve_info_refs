{
  "CVE-2015-7852": {
    "Description": "A potential off-by-one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a buffer overflow potentially resulting in a null byte being written out of bounds.",
    "Root cause": "Off-by-one error in the `cookedprint` functionality of `ntpq` when handling specially crafted buffers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A specially crafted NTP packet could cause `ntpq` to crash, or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted mode 6 response packets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know or control the port that ntpq is listening on and the precise moment it is listening, or the attacker can provide a malicious instance of ntpd to which victims connect."
