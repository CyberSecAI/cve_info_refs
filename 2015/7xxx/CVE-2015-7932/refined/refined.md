The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7932.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information due to the lack of SSL support in the Adcon Telemetry A840 Telemetry Gateway Base Station.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). Because there is no SSL support, all communication is unencrypted, making it easily readable over the network.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can eavesdrop on network communication and gain access to sensitive data transmitted in plaintext. This could lead to a loss of confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attacks by intercepting network communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic to the A840 Telemetry Gateway Base Station. No specific skills are mentioned other than the ability to capture network traffic. The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
