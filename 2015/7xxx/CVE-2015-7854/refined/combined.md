NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

# NTP BUG 2921: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability

Last update: April 22, 2024 18:49 UTC ([7e7bd5857](https://git.nwtime.org/websites/ntpwww/commit/7e7bd5857f893277639b3765bf9347c4c6faa447))

---

#### Summary

| **Resolved** | [4.2.8p4](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8p4-release-announcement/) | 21 Oct 2015 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **References** | [Bug 2921](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2921) | [CVE-2015-7854](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-7854) |
| **Affects** | All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77. | Resolved in 4.2.8p4. |
| **CVSS2 Score** | 0.0 best case, 1.7 usual case, 6.8, worst case | [AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:C/A:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator?calculator&version=2.0&vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:C/I:C/A:C)) |

---

#### Description

If `ntpd` is configured to allow remote configuration, and if the (possibly spoofed) source IP address is allowed to send remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the remote configuration password or if `ntpd` was (foolishly) configured to disable authentication, then an attacker can send a set of packets to `ntpd` that may cause it to crash, with the hypothetical possibility of a small code injection.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF’s `ntpd` requires:
  + an explicitly configured “trusted” key. Only configure this if you need it.
  + access from a permitted IP address. You choose the IPs.
  + authentication. Don’t disable it. Practice secure key safety.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

---

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Yves Younan and Aleksander Nikolich of Cisco Talos.

# NTP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201607-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in NTP, the worst of which
could lead to Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ntp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.8\_p8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.8\_p8** |

### Background

NTP contains software for the Network Time Protocol.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in NTP. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NTP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/ntp-4.2.8_p8"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1274263#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 11:32:09 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in ntpd:  A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the password management functionality of ntp. A specially crafted key file could cause a buffer overflow potentially resulting in memory being modified. An attacker could provide a malicious password to trigger this vulnerability.  External References:  <http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0065/> <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#October_2015_NTP_Security_Vulner>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1274263#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-23 07:53:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1274263#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-23 09:03:41 UTC  ``` In version 4.2.6 and earlier of NTP (shipped with RHEL 5, 6, 7), the key size is written in an array rather than dynamically allocated memory (as happens in 4.2.8). The following code handles the size allocation and is not vulnerable to the reported buffer overflow:  sk->keylen = min(len, sizeof(sk->k.MD5_key)); memcpy(sk->k.MD5_key, key, sk->keylen);   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1274263#c3)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-23 09:21:16 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/9c22e66c8f2be6aa0c846f0d9804db20f93c105d>   ``` |  |

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetAppÂ® products contain the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd). The Open NTP project (www.ntp.org) has released a Security Notice regarding vulnerabilities that affect versions before ntp-4.2.8p4. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to modify data, execute arbitrary code, cause a process crash or Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to data modification, arbitrary code execution, process crashes or Denial of Service (DoS).

Clustered Data ONTAP and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode were only found to be affected by CVE-2015-5300, CVE-2015-7704, and CVE-2015-7705.

The only generally-exploitable bug in the above list is the crypto-NAK bug, which has a CVSS2 score of 6.4.

Additionally, three bugs that have already been fixed in ntp-4.2.8 but were not fixed in ntp-4.2.6 as it was EOL’d have a security component, but are all below 1.8 CVSS score, so we’re reporting them here:

* [2382: Peer precision < -31 gives division by zero](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug2382/)
* [1774: Segfaults if cryptostats enabled when built without OpenSSL](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1774/)
