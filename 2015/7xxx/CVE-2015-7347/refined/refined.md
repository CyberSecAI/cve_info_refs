Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   The root cause is that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized in the `author` field within the comment functionality. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be stored in the database and executed when viewed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the `author` field is stored in the database. This code will be executed whenever a user views the comment, resulting in persistent cross-site scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users viewing the affected content.
*   This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the comment functionality, specifically the `author` field.
*   An attacker would craft malicious JavaScript within the `author` input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the page where the comments can be entered and submitted
*   No specific privileges other than the ability to post comments are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in ZCMS version 1.1.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the "author" field.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable through a GET request.
*   The provided exploit code example injects `<script>alert(666)</script>` into the author field to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, a SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2015-7346) which is also present in ZCMS 1.1.
