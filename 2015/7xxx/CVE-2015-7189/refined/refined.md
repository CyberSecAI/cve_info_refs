  "CVE-2015-7189": {
    "Description": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `nsJPEGEncoder::ConvertHostARGBRow()` within the Canvas2D graphics component of Mozilla Firefox. This occurs due to mismatched canvas and context sizes when converting a canvas to a blob, particularly when the `toBlob` function is called during a `DOMAttrModified` event.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a race condition where the canvas's dimensions are modified, and the `toBlob` function is called before the context has a chance to update to match the new dimensions.  This mismatch in sizes leads to a heap buffer overflow in the `ConvertHostARGBRow()` function during the encoding process, as it expects the dimensions to match.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service through an application crash due to the memory corruption.  There is also the potential for arbitrary code execution due to the overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting Javascript event handlers like DOMAttrModified",
      "Manipulating Canvas elements and triggering the toBlob function during specific timing conditions"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker must be able to inject and execute JavaScript code to modify the Canvas element's attributes and trigger the `toBlob` method at a precise moment when the canvas and context sizes mismatch."
