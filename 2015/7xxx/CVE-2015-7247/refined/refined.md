Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from sensitive information leakage within the device's configuration backup. Usernames, passwords, keys, values, and web account hashes for "super" and "admin" accounts are stored in cleartext, without masking, within the backup file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** Sensitive credentials are not encrypted or hashed in the configuration backup.
- **Unprotected Access:**  The backup file is accessible to the restricted "support" user, despite containing administrative credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious actor or even a low-privileged "support" user can obtain cleartext administrator credentials.
- **Full Device Control:** Gaining access to administrator credentials allows an attacker to gain full unauthorized control of the device.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information, such as passwords and keys, is exposed.
- **Integrity Loss:**  An attacker with admin access can modify the device's configuration or firmware.
- **Availability Loss:** The attacker can disrupt the device's operation, potentially rendering it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Backup File:** The primary attack vector is the configuration backup file itself, which contains the sensitive information in cleartext.
- **Web Portal Access:**  A low-privileged "support" user can directly access the backup file via the web portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Device's Web Portal:** The attacker needs access to the device's web interface to access the backup file. This could be through local network access or through remote management if exposed to the internet.
- **Low-Privilege User Access:** The attacker does not need to be an admin user. Even a limited "support" user can potentially access the configuration backup file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description, outlining the specific parameters and the way an attacker could get clear text credentials.
- The vulnerable device is identified as a D-Link DVG-N5402SP, running specific firmware versions.
- The report notes that other vulnerabilities exist in this device (CVE-2015-7245, CVE-2015-7246).
- The identified vulnerability is not directly related to a file path traversal or hard coded credentials.

This report highlights a serious security flaw where sensitive credentials are not properly protected, allowing for unauthorized access and control over the D-Link device.
