Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7613:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A data race condition exists in the Linux kernel's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) subsystem, specifically during the initialization of SysV shared memory objects.
*   The `ipc_addid()` function adds a new IPC object to a shared object table before its `uid` and `gid` fields are initialized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Data Race:** Multiple threads can concurrently access and modify the IPC object's state during creation, leading to a race condition.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Data:** The `ipc_obtain_object_check()` function, which checks permissions, reads the `uid` and `gid` fields of the IPC object. Since these fields are not initialized at the time of table insertion they can have arbitrary values, leading to a potential bypass of permission checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access to shared memory:** A local attacker could gain access to arbitrary SysV shared memory. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By gaining access to shared memory, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges, as many systems rely on IPC for inter-process communication.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There's a strong possibility the vulnerability could be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution in the kernel. This would grant an attacker complete control of the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could potentially lead to system crashes due to the use of uninitialized data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local, unprivileged user.
*   **Race Condition Trigger:** The attacker must trigger the `ipc_addid()` call and then win the race to access the shared object prior to proper initialization of its attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user account:** An attacker needs a regular local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to make system calls:** Attacker needs to make appropriate system calls (`msgget`, `shmget`, and related calls) to trigger the race condition.

**Additional details from the analysis:**

*   The vulnerability affects `msg.c`, `shm.c` and `util.c` files in the kernel source code.
*   The issue was discovered by Dmitry Vyukov while working on the KernelThreadSanitizer (KTSAN).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the upstream kernel by commit `b9a532277938`.
*   Multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu, SUSE, Red Hat, Debian) have issued security advisories and patches to address this vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions that a similar issue existed for SysV semaphore arrays, but was less severe as they are cleared before being fully initialized.
* The `ipc_addid()` installs the object with `idr_alloc` making it immediately accessible to other threads.
*   The flawed logic involved filling in `uid`, `gid` and other fields after initial allocation via `idr_alloc`
* The fix pushes filling these parameters before making the object accessible to other threads.
