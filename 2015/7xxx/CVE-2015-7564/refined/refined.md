Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the TeamPass application, specifically in the `item.query.php` and `view.query.php` files, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- **Data Breach:** This could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data, including user credentials and passwords.
- **Complete System Compromise:** A successful SQL injection could potentially lead to complete compromise of the application server and underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The identified attack vectors are:
1.  **`item.query.php`:** The `id` parameter with `type=action_on_quick_icon` is vulnerable.
2.  **`view.query.php`:** The `order` and `direction` parameters when `type` is set to `connections_logs`, `errors_logs`, or `access_logs` are vulnerable. The `direction` parameter needs to be prefixed by ", " to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable application.
- **No authentication required**: No prior authentication is needed for this vulnerability

**Technical Details**

*   The `item.query.php` file is vulnerable through the `id` parameter when the `type` parameter is set to `action_on_quick_icon`.
*   The `view.query.php` file is vulnerable through the `order` and `direction` parameters when the `type` parameter is set to `connections_logs`, `errors_logs`, or `access_logs`.
*   The `direction` parameter must be prefixed with ", " to be exploitable.
*   Exploitation can lead to reading arbitrary data from the database.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects TeamPass version 2.1.24 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `795256f` and `86719e0` (as noted in the provided github link `https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/pull/1140`)
*   The exploit-db entry provides specific SQL injection payloads that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical), due to the high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
