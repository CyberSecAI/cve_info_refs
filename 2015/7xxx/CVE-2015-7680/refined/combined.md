# **Identify** your vulnerabilities

## before others do …

# **Secure?** For Sure!

![Expresse](/assets/images/expresse.jpg)

**Nowadays** itâs incredibly hard to imagine companies are not relying on IT-systems as they, most of the time secretly in the background, fulfill important tasks. From office networks or internet portals for clients and partners up to highly-specified assembly lines in factories, IT systems and their services enable employers to work more efficient.

Even business critical processes depend more and more on smoothly flowing IT services. Most of the time this is accomplished by using a broad set of different IT products and technologies. Besides high availability of these services, particularly the security of processed data is important. Needless to say, no company wants to see their confidential information in the hands of someone else.

How can we permanently maintain a level of highest security? And just as important, how can one make sure that current security is adequate?

Profundis Labs is an IT Security company based in Munich Germany. We provide consulting services and technical assessments like [**Penetration Tests**](/services/penetrationtest) and [**Security Audits**](/services/audit) to actively check the security of your company data. Furthermore our consulting service is independent of manufacturers and weâll make your employees become more aware to the issue of security.

# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

## Using Fulldisclosure

To post a message to all the list members, send email to
fulldisclosure@seclists.org.

You can subscribe to the list, or change your existing
subscription, in the sections below.
## Subscribing to Fulldisclosure

Subscribe to Fulldisclosure by filling out the following
form.
You will be sent email requesting confirmation, to
prevent others from gratuitously subscribing you. This is a hidden list, which means that the
list of members is available only to the list administrator.

Your name (optional):

You may enter a
privacy password below. This provides only mild security,
but should prevent others from messing with your
subscription. **Do not use a valuable password** as
it will occasionally be emailed back to you in cleartext.

If you choose not to enter a password, one will be
automatically generated for you, and it will be sent to
you once you've confirmed your subscription. You can
always request a mail-back of your password when you edit
your personal options.

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

 Pursuant to the Ipswitch File Transfer “Product Lifecycle and EOL Policy,” Ipswitch File Transfer
announces the End-of-Availability (EOA), End-of-Sales (EOS) and End-of-Life (EOL) dates for MOVEit
DMZ 8.0. As of October 1st, 2015, all MOVEit DMZ 8.0 versions enter their Maintenance Phase. On
April 1st, 2016 all MOVEit DMZ 8.0 versions enter their Sunset Phase, and an EOL date of October 1st,
2016 has been set. That EOL date will also mark the End-of-Maintenance (EOM) for these product

support include MOVEit DMZ 7.5. Post-EOM Maintenance Extensions may be granted in select cases, at
the discretion of Ipswitch File Transfer. Willingness to grant a Maintenance Extension will depend on the
availability of suitable Active-Support upgrade alternatives, among other factors. Customers interested in
a Maintenance Extension are encouraged to contact their Ipswitch File Transfer Sales Representative to
learn more. During the Sunset Phase of these product versions’ lifecycle, and prior to EOL/EOM, the
product versions will continue to be fully supported for existing customers through all main channels of

granted in select cases, at the discretion of Ipswitch File Transfer. Willingness to grant a Maintenance
Extension will depend on the availability of suitable Active-Support upgrade alternatives, among other
factors. Customers interested in a Maintenance Extension are encouraged to contact their Ipswitch File
Transfer Sales Representative to learn more. During the Sunset Phase of these product versions’ lifecycle,
and prior to EOL/EOM, the product versions will continue to be fully supported for existing customers

the product’s knowledge base.

Upgrading to 8.2

3

Upgrading to 8.2

The upgrade to MOVEit v.8.2 requires that you have a new license file. License keys from previous
versions will no longer work.

To get a new license file, go to the Customer Portal (https://ipswitchft.secure.force.com/cp/) to manage
and download your licenses. If you do not have access, click the New User? link to register. Watch the
Overview Video for instructions on how to use the My Licenses tab after you've logged in.

If you have difficulty gaining access to the Customer Portal or downloading your updated license, please
create a case through the Customer Portal (located under My Cases) or use the form at: Ipswitch MOVEit
Support (http://www.ipswitchft.com/Company/ContactSupport.aspx).

Note: To upgrade to MOVEit DMZ v.8.2, your current installed version of MOVEit DMZ must be v.6.5 or
later.

Note: Back-up your existing license file before upgrading. If you need to rollback you will need to reapply
your old license file. To locate your existing license file, follow the steps in this KB article
(http://ipswitchft.force.com/kb#!/article/How-do-I-locate-my-current-MOVEit-DMZ-license-file-or-seri
al-number/find%20license).

Note: Many custom templates that were installed for previous versions of MOVEit DMZ can cause most
web interface pages in MOVEit DMZ 8.1 and later to not function properly. If your MOVEit DMZ
installation relies on custom templates, see the KB article: How can I tell if my MOVEit DMZ
installation relies on custom templates?
(http://ipswitchft.force.com/kb/articles/FAQ/How-can-I-tell-if-my-MOVEit-DMZ-installation-relies-on-
custom-templates) This article includes instructions for updating your custom templates. If you are not
sure whether your installation relies on custom templates, the article shows you how to find out.

Licensees

Users who are licensed for one or more of the MOVEit products can upgrade, at no additional cost, under
their prepaid maintenance coverage.    Copies of the v.8.2 products will be placed on the Ipswitch
Customer Portal, and email notifications will be sent to the designated technical contacts at select
licensees.

Onsite Evaluators

Users who are doing an onsite evaluation of one or more of the above MOVEit products can upgrade to
v.8.2, at no additional cost, after it is commercially released.    Copies of v.8.2 will be placed on the
Ipswitch Customer Portal, and email notifications sent, so that onsite evaluators can login, download, and
install the product. If a new evaluation license is needed in order to evaluate v.8.2, then onsite evaluators
can request one from their Ipswitch sales representative.

4

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

Online Evaluators

Users who are conducting an online evaluation of MOVEit will have their evaluation account
automatically upgraded to v.8.2 by MOVEit support staff, at no additional cost, after it is commercially
released. Online evaluators can contact their Ipswitch sales representative to request an extension of their
evaluation in order to consider v.8.2.

5

New Features, Enhancements, and Bug
Fixes

New Features 8.2

New Feature: Shared Mailboxes

The Shared Mailbox feature lets multiple users/groups view and manage packages from a single mailbox.
Users/groups who have access to a shared mailbox can view, send, and reply to packages in the shared
mailbox using their own user account. Administrators can share access to a mailbox to receive packages in
a central location that is accessible to multiple users/groups, or to let a user perform package actions on
behalf of another user.

The Shared Mailbox feature is available to registered users only.

Mobile 1.2.2 and Outlook Plug-in 2.5 support the new Shared Mailbox feature.

Prerequisite: Enable Administrator Package Access

Before any organization administrators can view and manage the Shared Mailbox feature, a sysadmin
must enable Administrator Package Access:

1  Sign in as a sysadmin.

2  Select Orgs, then select the organization that contains a mailbox you want to share.

3  Under Security Information > Administrator Package Access, verify that Package/attachment viewing is
set to either Admins only or Admins and GroupAdmins. Click Change Settings to enable one of these
options.

Enable a Shared Mailbox

1  Sign in as an administrator. You cannot be signed in as a sysadmin.

2  Go to Users and select the user whose mailbox you want to share.

3  Scroll to the bottom of the page to see Shared Mailbox Information. Initially no users/groups have

access to a user’s mailbox. Click Edit Shared Mailboxes for this User.

4  Select the users/groups who will have shared access to this mailbox and then click Add Entries. The
user profile now shows the users/groups you selected as having access to this user's mailbox.

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

View Packages in a Shared Mailbox

My Mailboxes appears at the top of the page as usual, followed by Mailboxes for each mailbox shared
with the signed-in user. In the figure, UserThree (the signed-in user) has access to shared mailboxes
owned by UserOne and UserTwo:

New Features, Enhancements, and Bug Fixes

7

You can perform most of the typical package actions within a shared mailbox, such as viewing and
replying to Inbox packages, creating, editing, and deleting Drafts and Templates, viewing Sent packages,
sent package read status, package history, and viewing packages in the Trash.

You cannot do any of the following in a shared mailbox:

  Create a custom mailbox ("Add Box...")
  Empty the Trash
  View Drafts that were created by anyone other than the currently signed-in user

Notifications

When a mailbox is shared, notifications are handled as follows:

New Package Notifications: When a package arrives in a shared mailbox, all users with access to the shared
mailbox receive an email notification of that package arrival (if an administrator has configured
notifications). You see My New Packages at the top of the page as usual, followed by New Packages for
each mailbox shared with you.

  Delivery Notifications: Both the signed-in user and the user in the package's "From:" field receive

delivery notifications. For example: UserOne's mailbox is shared with UserTwo. UserTwo sends a
package and selects UserOne in the package's "From:" field. UserOne and UserTwo both receive
delivery receipt notifications. Notifications are sent as follows:

  Package Read: Notification is sent when a package is read by the owner of the shared mailbox or

by any user with access to the shared mailbox.

  Attachment Downloaded: Notification is sent when a recipient, or anyone with shared access to a

recipient’s mailbox, downloads the attachment.

8

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

  Package Deleted: Notification is sent when a recipient deletes the package from the Trash without

reading it. Notification is NOT sent when a user, with shared access to a recipient's mailbox, puts a
package into the Trash.

  User Deleted: Notification is sent when a recipient’s user account is deleted before reading the
package. Notification is NOT sent when a user, with shared access to a recipient's mailbox, is
deleted before reading the package.

Note: To enable delivery notifications, the sender must select Delivery Receipt at the package level.

New Features, Enhancements, and Bug Fixes

9

Read Status

To see a package's Read Status, you must view it in the Sent folder of the mailbox that sent it. For
example, UserOne's mailbox is shared with UserTwo. UserTwo sends a package and selects UserOne in
the package's "From:" field. The package is sent from UserOne's mailbox. To view that package's Read
Status, UserTwo must open UserOne's Sent mailbox. When you open a sent package and click More next
to Read Status, you see only the package's recipients. You do not see users who have shared access to a
recipient's mailbox.

Note: If you send a package to a user who shared his mailbox with other users, you will not have visibility
to others that can access the package.

Marking Packages New/Not New

You can mark only your own new packages ‘not new’ on the Packages screen.

New packages in shared mailboxes will remain 'new' until one of the following events occur:

  The owner of the shared mailbox views the package
  Any user who has access to this shared mailbox views the package and marks it ‘not new’ from within

the package

If a user views a package in a shared mailbox and marks it new/not new from within the package, that
package will be marked new/not new for all other users with access to that shared mailbox.

Sending a Package From a Shared Mailbox

To send a new package from a shared mailbox, sign in with your own user account as usual, create a new
package, and in the From: field select the mailbox from which you want to send the new package.
Mailboxes shared with you are also visible within the Outlook plug-in for your selection.

Note: The contents of the address book belong to the selected user.

Replies and Forwards

When replying to or forwarding a package in a shared mailbox, the From: field always shows the owner of
the shared mailbox.

Log Entries

When a user performs an action in a shared mailbox package, that user appears under Username and the
name of the shared mailbox owner appears under Target.

When a user uploads a file to a package, that user appears under Username regardless of the mailbox.

User Settings

10

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

The shared mailbox owner's user settings always take precedence over the signed-in user's settings. The
only exception is DLP Ruleset. The signed-in user's DLP Ruleset is always respected.

Mobile

You can access shared mailboxes from within MOVEit Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile
1.2.2 Help.

Outlook Plug-in

You can access shared mailboxes from within the Outlook Plug-in. For more information, see the Outlook
Plug-in 2.5 Help.

New Feature: Turn Off Log Archival

You now have the option to turn off the archival of old logs. In Settings > Miscellaneous > Aging > Audit
Logs, uncheck Archive old log entries to /Archive/Logs before deleting.

New Feature: New Custom Notification Macros

Added support for partial string matching in "If" statements within custom DMZ notification definitions
so that notification text can vary depending on whether the notification is sent to an internal or external
email address. Added the following operators to custom notification macros:

= contains

For example, if the notification recipient is bound for a gmail account:

New Feature: Send Package Automatically After Successful Wizard
Upload

Added an option to the package upload Wizard to automatically send the package after uploading
attachments. This allows very large attachments to be sent without waiting for the upload to complete.

To use this feature when sending a package, select all package options prior to file upload. Launch the
Wizard and select the file(s) to upload. Select Close Wizard when Done, then check Also send package
immediately.

New Feature: Option to Hide SQL in Report Output

In previous releases, when creating reports in HTML format, the SQL query that generated the content
was always included at the end of the report. While this information was useful for administrators, it was
considered a vulnerability when reports were distributed to users for whom the database structure should
not be disclosed. In the current release, you have the option of including or not including SQL queries
when defining the report.

New Feature: Reactivate Expired Temp User Accounts If Package
Received

A new option for unregistered recipients (temp users) was added to allow expired (but not deleted) temp
user accounts to be reactivated when they receive a new package. Go to Settings > Ad Hoc Transfer >
Unregistered Recipients > Advanced Options and select Reactivate expired temporary users when they
receive a package.

New Feature: Silent Install Parameters for Ad Hoc Transfer Plug-in for
Outlook

Added two new command-line silent install parameters for Ad Hoc Transfer Plug-in for Outlook:

DEFAULT_TEMPPATH
DEFAULT_USETEMP

These new parameters can be appended to the end of the silent install command.

Example:

DEFAULT_TEMPPATH="%APPDATA%\Ipswitch\AttachmentManager\Temp"
DEFAULT_USETEMP="TRUE"

The DEFAULT_TEMPPATH parameter determines the location of temp files.

The DEFAULT_USETEMP parameter determines whether attachments are always copied to temp first.
DMZ must sometimes use the temp directory even when using temp is disabled. This parameter adds an
internal package flag that indicates that the attachment is a temp file and is okay to delete.

MOVEit DMZ Release Notes 8.2

Enhancements 8.2

Added support for MS SQL 2014 (MIDMZ-5220)

MOVEit DMZ now supports Microsoft SQL Server 2014.

Updated to Java 8

MOVEit DMZ Java API, Wizard and Xfer are updated to use the latest update of Java 8. Browsers will
need the Java 8 JRE in order to run the Java Wizard.

Upgraded SSH server (MIDMZ-1068)

The SSH server was upgraded to support SHA256 and SHA512 HMAC hashes and SHA256
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The new HMAC hashes are added automatically and enabled on upgrades.
On new installs, the older MD5 and SHA1-96 hashes are disabled by default, but can be manually enabled
for older client compatibility.

SHA256 Hash Certificate (MIDMZ-6147)

The self-signed certificate created during the install is now signed with a SHA256 hash.

In orgs where some users can send packages and some cannot, users who cannot send packages
can now read packages they receive and download the attachments (MIDMZ-4917)

In most cases, when sending packages (Ad Hoc Transfer) is enabled, it is enabled for an entire
organization. However, in some cases only members of certain groups are allowed to send packages. In
those cases, it is possible for a user who is not allowed to send packages to be the recipient of a package,
and there was no way for that user to view the package he/she received. We created a way to receive and
read the package and download attachments, while still maintaining the restriction on sending packages.

Updated MIMobile to use to latest Tomcat and OpenSSL (MBL-2107)

Apache Tomcat is upgraded to version 7.0.57. This version disables SSL v3 by default. OpenSSL is
upgraded to version 1.01p.

Updated TLS Cipher suites for Tomcat (MBL-2247)

For new installs and upgrades, the SSL Cipher Suite in Tomcat is updated to the latest security
recommendations. On upgrades, we automatically change the SSL Cipher Suite if it has not been changed
since the previous Mobile version. If it has been modified already by the administrator, we won't apply
any changes. The recommended Cipher Suite list is:

SSLCipherSuite="ALL:!ADH:!SSLv2:!EXP:!LOW:!DES:!3DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!DH:!IDEA:!aNULL:!NU
LL”

Exception occurred when a user attempted to
delete folders or virtual folders within nested virtual
folders by clicking "Delete" under "Selected

when the user clicks the "X" button to the right of
the file to delete it. This issue is fixed.

When the scheduled task DeletePendingUsers sent
an expired account notification, it set the return
address to "base email address," which is a
system-level setting stored in the registry. Fixed this
so the notification's return address uses the
address show in the organization's Settings >

SSO configuration now supports SHA-256 for
hashing in XML signatures.

When authenticating with an Authentication Only
source, Template settings in Edit LDAP User
Settings for the Auth Source are correctly applied
only to new users whose accounts are created
when the user signs on.

In previous releases, the Template settings were
applied to both new and existing users, which
caused the FullName of the existing users to be
overwritten by their Username.

MIDMZ-1074

Fixed a problem that prevented the Upload
Comment field from being included in downloads,
mostly affecting MOVEit Central. It only occurred
when the database was Microsoft SQL. Reordering
some SQL queries resolved the issue.

When a database was migrated from MySQL to
MSSQL, changes to transaction locking were not
implemented. READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOP is
now set when migrating to SQL Server.

When converting from MySQL to MSSQL, the rare
condition where a text field has a NULL value was
not handled correctly. The conversion program now
handles it.

Fixed an issue that occurred during installs to large
preexisting SQL servers, which would timeout while
adding the stored procedures. The timeout duration
during this step has been increased to avoid this
failure.

Because of changes in Java plug-in handling in
Chrome and possibly other browsers, a message
was added to the Java Wizard page with a link to a

Performance

Performance

Some performance issues were addressed that
related to having to generate folder permissions
every time a user signs in to the system. Options
now allow folder permissions to be cached in the
database so that sign-ons do not need to generate
permissions from scratch.

Support for significantly large collections of file or
audit log entries has been enhanced to provide
much better performance during relative database
queries. Part of the enhancement includes setting
the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database
option for MS SQL databases. This will provide
significant performance improvement for customers
using MS SQL for heavily loaded systems.

Read Committed Snapshot Isolation (RCSI)
introduces a new dependency in order to relieve
concurrency problems. Namely, TempDB is used
heavily for reads and writes. It is important for large
scale implementations to use high performance
storage for TempDB. On very large MOVEit DMZ
systems, Ipswitch recommends that a database
administrator perform additional tuning. All
implementations must have a working TempDB.
Errors or exceptions observed in this little-known
database should be closely examined because in
all likelihood users will be affected if RCSI is
hampered by a broken TempDB.

Administrators should refer to Microsoft SQL Server
documentation on
“READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT”, “Row
Versioning,” and “TempDB” for a fuller treatment of
the issues surrounding this feature.

The READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT option does
not apply to MySQL databases. However other
enhancements for file and audit log queries apply to
both database types.

The Java API now exposes the session cookie and
CSRF token as attributes.

Ad Hoc Transfer  Fixed a problem where package templates used the

MIDMZ-1662

expiration policy that is applied to other packages
and it appeared they were being deleted when they
were actually hidden. The fix restores any
templates that were previously hidden and ignores
the expiration.

Ad Hoc Transfer  Restructured an SQL query that prevented the
package delete preview page from displaying.

MIDMZ-5909

Ad Hoc Transfer  When replying to a package in the web interface,

MIDMZ-6547

the format of the "from" header displayed in the
reply has been changed. It used to display the
internal user ID; it has been changed to display the
user login name.

Ad Hoc Transfer  Fixed a problem related to the new "Send on Behalf

MIDMZ-5957

of the sender" option that uses the sender's email
address as the "from" address in notifications.
When a user had more than one email address
configured and Send on Behalf of Sender was set
to Yes, we failed to send the Notification due to the
comma. When a user had an apostrophe in their
email address and Send on Behalf of Sender was
set to Yes, we failed to send the notification due to
the apostrophe. Both issues were corrected.

Ad Hoc Transfer  Fixed a problem in package handling where, after a

MIDMZ-5938

session timeout and signing back in, the package
compose page displayed with attachments that
were sent previously. This was a cosmetic problem
only and not a security issue. The attachments
weren't really part of the package. Fixed this issue
so that previous data is not displayed after the
timeout event.

Ad Hoc Transfer  Fixed an issue where sorting by read status failed

MIDMZ-5922

with SQL Server.

Ad Hoc Transfer  When selecting "Email the note" instead of "Secure

MIDMZ-6065

the note" when an email notification is sent in text
(not HTML), line breaks were not included in the
text version of the note. Added logic to maintain line
breaks when converting to text for the notification.

to 16384 characters.

There is a rare case when the previous version of
Mobile was installed in a custom directory that is a
root directory, that is, not a sub-folder.    When the
previous version is uninstalled as part of the
upgrade, the installer will crash with an error.    For
this configuration it is recommended that you
manually uninstall the previous version of Mobile,
remove the custom directory after the installer
crashes, then run the new install.
