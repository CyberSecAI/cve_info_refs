Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated user to check for the existence of usernames through the `machine.aspx` controller using XML/SOAP login requests. The server returns specific error codes that reveal whether a given username exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of information about valid user accounts. The system's response to login attempts, specifically through the error codes, allows an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** Attackers can identify valid usernames on the system.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing valid usernames allows attackers to focus their efforts on attempting password-based attacks, potentially leading to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack involves sending specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/machine.aspx` endpoint.
- **XML/SOAP:** Exploitation utilizes XML/SOAP to simulate login attempts with different usernames.
- **Error Code Analysis:** The attack relies on interpreting specific error codes to determine if a username is valid or not.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable MOVEit DMZ instance.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The following error codes are used to determine user existence:
- `ErrorCode 2050`: Username does not exist
- `ErrorCode 2025`: Username exists but password is wrong or user is locked
- `ErrorCode 0`: Username exists and right password was provided

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions a fix for several information disclosure vulnerabilities, including user and file enumeration (MIDMZ-6570, MIDMZ-6571).
- This vulnerability was present in MOVEit DMZ v8.1 and below.
- A patch was released by the vendor on October 20, 2015.
- This vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
-  The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET requests (likely meaning the POST requests can be initiated through a GET request).
- The vendor reference number for this issue is MIDMZ-6571

This information provides more detail than the official CVE description, including the specific mechanism of exploitation, the exact error codes used to enumerate users, and the HTTP endpoint involved.
