Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the ZCMS 1.1 login authentication mechanism. The application constructs SQL queries using concatenated user input without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The login form takes user input for the password, and directly concatenates this input into an SQL query. Specifically, the `request.getParameter("pass")` is directly embedded into the query string.
    *   `squerry="SELECT COUNT(username) AS usercount FROM "+TABLE_PREFIX+"users WHERE status = 0 AND username = '"+username+"' AND password = '"+request.getParameter("pass") +"' AND type = 1 ;";`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:**  An attacker can bypass the admin login by injecting SQL code into the password field.  A payload like  `' OR '2'='2` will force the query to return a valid result.
*   **Data Breach:** The SQL injection vulnerability could potentially be leveraged further to gain access to other data stored within the application's database.
*   **Persistent XSS Injection:** As stated in the advisory, SQL injection allows for persistent XSS payloads to be injected directly into the database, bypassing input filters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is the login form, specifically the "pass" parameter. By manipulating this input an attacker can bypass authentication.
*   **Other Input Fields:** The SQL injection vulnerability can also be leveraged to inject data in other input fields such as title, content and author fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ZCMS instance, specifically the login form.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure way user input is handled when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the password parameter in the login form directly concatenates user input into the SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL Injection. This enables an attacker to bypass authentication, inject malicious code into the database, and potentially gain access to sensitive data. The vulnerability is rated as high severity due to the potential impact and ease of exploitation.
