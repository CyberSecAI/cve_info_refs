- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  XSS attacks can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input that is not properly validated. This likely means an attacker can inject malicious code through user input fields or other means that are processed by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to submit input to the vulnerable application. This does not require specific privileges but might require access to a user interface or API that takes user input.
