Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-7818:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM System Networking Switch Center (SNSC) Web Service providing access to the Apache Axis AdminService.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated access to the Apache Axis AdminService via the IBM SNSC Web Service.
- The ability to publish arbitrary classes through the deployment method of the Axis AdminService.
- Allows for the installation of arbitrary .jsp files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable IBM SNSC installation.
- The installed .jsp files run under the context of SYSTEM, meaning the attacker gains the highest level of privileges on the system.
- Local Privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local unprivileged access to the vulnerable IBM SNSC system.
- Network access to the vulnerable service is possible as it listens on ports 40080 (HTTP) or 40443 (HTTPS), however, the advisory specifies a local attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be local to the system or have network access to ports 40080 (HTTP) or 40443 (HTTPS)
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of Apache Axis AdminService and JSP is needed to construct the attack.

The advisory provides more detail than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable component (IBM SNSC Web Service using Apache Axis), the attack method (publishing arbitrary classes and installing JSP files), and the system context where code is executed.
