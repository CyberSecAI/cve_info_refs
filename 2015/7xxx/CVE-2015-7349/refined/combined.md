# CVE-2015-7349 - Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in DIGIPASS authentication for Citrix Web Interface

## 1. Vulnerability Properties

**Title:Â**Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in DIGIPASS authentication for Citrix Web Interface

**CVE ID:**Â CVE-2015-7349

**CVSSv3 Base Score:Â**4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Vendor:** Vasco (https://www.vasco.com)

**Products:**Â DIGIPASS authentication for Citrix Web Interface

**Advisory Release Date:**Â 6 October 2015

**Advisory URL:**Â https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2015-7349

**Credits:Â**Discovery by Filipe Bernardo <fb[at]integrity.pt>

## 2. Vulnerability Summary

Vasco DIGIPASS authentication for Citrix Web Interface is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting (XSS) on the login page.

The DIGIPASS plug-in is installed on IIS server and when a user attempts to login and an error occurs, this plugin handles the action and shows an error message displaying the reason. The ***failmessage*** parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

## 3. Technical Details

When a login error occurs the ***failmessage*** parameter displays an error message from the DIGIPASS plug-in with the information regarding the error.

This ***failmessage*** parameter is vulnerable and it's possible to inject javascript code that is reflected and runs on the client browser. To exploit this an attacker only needs to provide a link to a user with a manipulated ***failmessage***Â payload to execute code in the victim browser.

The standard URL of the vulnerable Authentication page is the following:

* www.yourdomain.com/Citrix/XenApp/auth/login.aspx

The vulnerable parameter isÂ ***failmessage.***

The attacker only needs to prepare an link with a javascript payload and the share this with a user, upon clicking the link the javascript will run on the client browser, the following image shows an example payload running the javascript and accessing the browser cookies:

## 4. Vulnerable Versions

* Assume all the VASCO DIGIPASS for Citrix Web Interface existent to the date.

## 5. Solution

* To mitigate this clients should "*disable the display of the login failure reason*"Â as mentioned in the VASCO KB140148
