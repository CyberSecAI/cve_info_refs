Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `failmessage` parameter in the Vasco DIGIPASS authentication for Citrix Web Interface login page not being properly sanitized. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `failmessage` parameter reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization or encoding, which allows malicious JavaScript code to execute in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information within the browser's context.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login prompts.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the login page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to download malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload within the `failmessage` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the crafted link. This could be achieved through phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or other social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with the malicious JavaScript code in the `failmessage` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to convince users to click the malicious link.
*   **No direct access to server:** The attacker does not need access to the target server directly, as this is a client-side vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the DIGIPASS plug-in for Citrix Web Interface.
*   The `failmessage` parameter is used to display error messages when login fails.
*   The vendor, Vasco, advised disabling the display of the login failure reason as a mitigation.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Citrix and Vasco in 2015.
*  The vulnerability was fixed by Vasco, with a security advisory released on 25/09/2015.
