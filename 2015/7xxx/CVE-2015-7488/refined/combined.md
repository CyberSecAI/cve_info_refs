# Security Bulletin: IBM Spectrum Scale is affected by a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7488)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in the current levels of IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1 thru 4.1.1.3 and V4.2.0.0 that could allow a local, unprivileged user or a user with network access to the IBM Spectrum Scale cluster, access to the LDAP directory bind user password when File protocol is deployed with LDAP / LDAP with Kerberos based authentication.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7488](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7488)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1 thru 4.1.1.3 and V4.2

## Remediation/Fixes

The following fixes will need to be applied to all nodes in the cluster regardless of whether they are configured as protocol nodes or not.

For IBM Spectrum Scale V4.1.1.0 thru 4.1.1.3, apply 4.1.1.4 available at <http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=4.1.1&platform=All&function=all>

For IBM Spectrum Scale V4.2, apply 4.2.0.1 available at

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=All&platform=All&function=all>

After all nodes have either been upgraded to 4.1.1.4 or 4.2.0.1, run the following commands:

* mmchconfig release=LATEST

  mmlsconfig minReleaseLevel

Verify the reported value of **minReleaseLevel** is 4.1.1.4 or higher. The value should be 4.2.0.1 if all nodes in the cluster are running with version 4.2.0.1 .
