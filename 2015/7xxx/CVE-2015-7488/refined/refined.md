- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Spectrum Scale handles LDAP directory bind user passwords when File protocol is deployed with LDAP or LDAP with Kerberos based authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the LDAP directory bind user password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user or a user with network access to the IBM Spectrum Scale cluster can gain access to the LDAP directory bind user password.
- **Attack vectors:** A local, unprivileged user or a user with network access to the IBM Spectrum Scale cluster.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs either local access or network access to the IBM Spectrum Scale cluster.
