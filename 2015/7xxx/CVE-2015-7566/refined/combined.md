## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-83.127~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-83.127~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-83-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-83.127~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-83.127~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4312 CVE-2015-7566 CVE-2015-8767 CVE-2016-0723
                 CVE-2016-0728

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial-of-service.

CVE-2013-4312

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that it is possible for a process to open
    far more files than the process' limit leading to denial-of-service
    conditions.

CVE-2015-7566

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
    driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
    endpoint is detected.

CVE-2015-8767

    An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
    local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
    handshake.

CVE-2016-0723

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
    A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.

CVE-2016-0728

    The Perception Point research team discovered a use-after-free
    vulnerability in the keyring facility, possibly leading to local
    privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1020452](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020452) [NEW], [1052256](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1052256) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [957988](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=957988) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The Kernel panics. A reboot is required. Ease of Exploitation: Trivial Vulnerability type: Wrong input validation Products: RHEL 7.1 including all updates Kernel-Version: 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64  (for debugging-purposes we used the CentOS Kernel kernel-debuginfo-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7)   Abstract The Kernel 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64 crashes when presented a buggy USB  device which requires the visor driver. Detailed product description We confirmed the bug on the following system: RHEL 7.1 Kernel = 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64 Further products or kernel versions have not been tested. How reproducible: Always Actual results: Kernel crashes   Description: The bug was found using the USB-fuzzing framework vUSBf from Sergej Schumilo  (github.com/schumilo) using the following device descriptor:   ######### PAYLOAD 1 ######### [*] Device-Descriptor   bLength:		0x12   bDescriptorType:	0x1   bcdUSB:		0x200   bDeviceClass:		0x3   bDeviceSubClass:	0x0   bDeviceProtocol:	0x0   bMaxPacketSize:	0x40   idVendor:		0x54c   idProduct:		0x144   bcdDevice:		0x100   iManufacturer:	0x1   iProduct:		0x2   iSerialNumbers:	0x3   bNumConfigurations:	0x1  The clie_5_attach function of the visor driver, which is called during the driver initialization process, expects an OUT-Bulk-Endpoint.  Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers.  This results in a crash of the system.   **** $ nm visor.ko.debug | grep clie_5_attach 0000000000000030 t clie_5_attach $ addr2line -e visor.ko.debug 6d /usr/src/debug/kernel-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7/linux-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7.x86_64/drivers/usb/serial/visor.c:610 ****  **** CentOS-Kernel linux-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7 (drivers/usb/serial/visor.c)         ... 607 608	pipe = usb_sndbulkpipe(serial->dev, port->bulk_out_endpointAddress); 609	for (j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE(port->write_urbs); ++j) 610		port->write_urbs[j]->pipe = pipe;  /* if there is no configured OUT-bulk-endpoint, the kernel tries to dereference null-pointers */ 611 612	return 0; 613 }         ... ****  	[*] Configuration-Descriptor 	  bLength:		0x9 	  bDescriptorType:	0x2 	  wTotalLength:		0x27 	  bNumInterfaces:	0x1 	  bConfigurationValue:	0x1 	  iConfiguration:	0x0 	  bmAttributes:		0x0 	  bMaxPower:		0x31 		[*] Interface-Descriptor 		  bLength:		0x9 		  bDescriptorType:	0x4 		  bInterfaceNumber:	0x0 		  bAlternateSetting:	0x0 		  bNumEndpoints:	0x3 		  bInterfaceClass:	0x0 		  bInterfaceSubClass:	0x0 		  bInterfaceProtocol:	0x0 			[*] Endpoint-Descriptor 			  bLength:		0x7 			  bDescriptorType:	0x5 			  bEndpointAddress:	0x81  <-- IN-Direction 			  bmAttribut:		0x1   <-- Interrupt-Transfer 			  wMaxPacketSize:	0x404 			  bInterval:		0xc 			[*] Endpoint-Descriptor 			  bLength:		0x7 			  bDescriptorType:	0x5 			  bEndpointAddress:	0x1   <-- OUT-Direction 			  bmAttribut:		0x1   <-- Interrupt-Transfer (change this value to 0x2, which is the value for bulk-transfer without additional features, and the visor driver won't crash) 			  wMaxPacketSize:	0x4 			  bInterval:		0xc 			[*] Endpoint-Descriptor 			  bLength:		0x7 			  bDescriptorType:	0x5 			  bEndpointAddress:	0x82  <-- IN-Direction 			  bmAttribut:		0x1   <-- Interrupt-Transfer 			  wMaxPacketSize:	0x4 			  bInterval:		0xc  Proof of Concept: 1) The bug can be reproduced using USB-fuzzing framework vUSBf from Sergej Schumilo (github.com/schumilo).  The attached vUSBf-obj file contains the payload. Please let us know if you would like to use the Facedancer board.  In such case, we could also provide a patched version of vUSBf which allows to reproduce vUSBf-Payloads using the Facedancer board. 2) For a proof of concept we are providing also an Arduino firmware file. Just flash it  on Arduino Leonardo and plug it into any RHEL machine. The Arduino will  emulate the defective USB device.     avrdude -v -p ATMEGA32u4 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 57600 -U flash:w:binary.hex  The file binary.hex has been attached to this bug report. To prevent automated sending of payloads, use a jumper to connect port D3 and  5V!   Severity and Ease of Exploitation The security weakness can be easily exploited. Using our Arduino firmware only  physical access to the system is required.    Additional info: Stacktrace, vUSBf-Payload, Arduino-Firmware attached.   Please assign a CVE for this issue since this is a local DoS of the targeted system.

# CVE-2015-7550

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-7549.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-7551.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-7550 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7550)

#### Description

The keyctl\_read\_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.4 does not properly use a semaphore, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that leverages a race condition between keyctl\_revoke and keyctl\_read calls.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information
leak or data loss.

CVE-2013-4312

    Tetsuo Handa discovered that users can use pipes queued on local
    (Unix) sockets to allocate an unfair share of kernel memory, leading
    to denial-of-service (resource exhaustion).

    This issue was previously mitigated for the stable suite by limiting
    the total number of files queued by each user on local sockets. The
    new kernel version in both suites includes that mitigation plus
    limits on the total size of pipe buffers allocated for each user.

CVE-2015-7566

    Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported that the visor
    driver crashes when a specially crafted USB device without bulk-out
    endpoint is detected.

CVE-2015-8767

    An SCTP denial-of-service was discovered which can be triggered by a
    local attacker during a heartbeat timeout event after the 4-way
    handshake.

CVE-2015-8785

    It was discovered that local users permitted to write to a file on a
    FUSE filesystem could cause a denial of service (unkillable loop in
    the kernel).

CVE-2015-8812

    A flaw was found in the iw_cxgb3 Infiniband driver. Whenever it
    could not send a packet because the network was congested, it would
    free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet again.
    This use-after-free could result in a denial of service (crash or
    hang), data loss or privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-8816

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the USB hub driver.
    This may be used by a physically present user for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2015-8830

    Ben Hawkes of Google Project Zero reported that the AIO interface
    permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or more in a single
    chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow when applied to
    certain filesystems, socket or device types. The full security
    impact has not been evaluated.

CVE-2016-0723

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the TIOCGETD ioctl.
    A local attacker could use this flaw for denial-of-service.

CVE-2016-0774

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2015-1805 in kernel versions older
    than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a partially
    failed atomic read. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
    to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user space.

CVE-2016-2069

    Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in flushing of the TLB
    when switching tasks on an x86 system. On an SMP system this could
    possibly lead to a crash, information leak or privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2384

    Andrey Konovalov found that a crafted USB MIDI device with an
    invalid USB descriptor could trigger a double-free. This may be used
    by a physically present user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2543

    Dmitry Vyukov found that the core sound sequencer driver (snd-seq)
    lacked a necessary check for a null pointer, allowing a user
    with access to a sound sequencer device to cause a denial-of-
    service (crash).

CVE-2016-2544, CVE-2016-2546, CVE-2016-2547, CVE-2016-2548

    Dmitry Vyukov found various race conditions in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound devices
    could use these to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2545

    Dmitry Vyukov found a flaw in list manipulation in the sound
    subsystem (ALSA)'s management of timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash or hang)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2016-2549

    Dmitry Vyukov found a potential deadlock in the sound subsystem
    (ALSA)'s use of high resolution timers. A user with access to sound
    devices could use this to cause a denial-of-service (hang).

CVE-2016-2550

    The original mitigation of CVE-2013-4312, limiting the total number
    of files a user could queue on local sockets, was flawed. A user
    given a local socket opened by another user, for example through the
    systemd socket activation mechanism, could make use of the other
    user's quota, again leading to a denial-of-service (resource
    exhaustion). This is fixed by accounting queued files to the sender
    rather than the socket opener.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by CVE-2015-8830.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4. CVE-2015-7566, CVE-2015-8767 and
CVE-2016-0723 were already fixed in DSA-3448-1. CVE-2016-0774 does not
affect the stable distribution.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE-2015-7566

| **Name** | CVE-2015-7566 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The clie\_5\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that lacks a bulk-out endpoint. |

that could leak kernel stack memory to userspace (bsc#983213).
- CVE-2016-1583: Prevent the usage of mmap when the lower file system does
not allow it. This could have lead to local privilege escalation when
ecryptfs-utils was installed and /sbin/mount.ecryptfs\_private was setuid
(bsc#983143).
- CVE-2016-4913: The get\_rock\_ridge\_filename function in fs/isofs/rock.c
in the Linux kernel mishandles NM (aka alternate name) entries
containing \0 characters, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted isofs filesystem (bnc#980725).
- CVE-2016-4580: The x25\_negotiate\_facilities function in
net/x25/x25\_facilities.c in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize
a certain data structure, which allowed attackers to obtain sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via an X.25 Call Request
(bnc#981267).
- CVE-2016-4805: Use-after-free vulnerability in
drivers/net/ppp/ppp\_generic.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash, or
spinlock) or possibly have unspecified other impact by removing a
network namespace, related to the ppp\_register\_net\_channel and
ppp\_unregister\_channel functions (bnc#980371).
- CVE-2016-0758: Tags with indefinite length could have corrupted pointers
in asn1\_find\_indefinite\_length (bsc#979867).
- CVE-2016-2187: The gtco\_probe function in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a
crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (bnc#971944).
- CVE-2016-4482: The proc\_connectinfo function in drivers/usb/core/devio.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain data structure, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted USBDEVFS\_CONNECTINFO ioctl call (bnc#978401).
- CVE-2016-2053: The asn1\_ber\_decoder function in lib/asn1\_decoder.c in
the Linux kernel allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (panic)
via an ASN.1 BER file that lacks a public key, leading to mishandling by
the public\_key\_verify\_signature function in
crypto/asymmetric\_keys/public\_key.c (bnc#963762).
- CVE-2016-4565: The InfiniBand (aka IB) stack in the Linux kernel
incorrectly relies on the write system call, which allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (kernel memory write operation) or possibly
have unspecified other impact via a uAPI interface (bnc#979548).
- CVE-2016-4485: The llc\_cmsg\_rcv function in net/llc/af\_llc.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain data structure, which allowed
attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by
reading a message (bnc#978821).
- CVE-2016-4578: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
certain r1 data structures, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via crafted use of the
ALSA timer interface, related to the (1) snd\_timer\_user\_ccallback and
(2) snd\_timer\_user\_tinterrupt functions (bnc#979879).
- CVE-2016-4569: The snd\_timer\_user\_params function in sound/core/timer.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain data structure, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via crafted use of the ALSA timer interface (bnc#979213).
- CVE-2016-4486: The rtnl\_fill\_link\_ifmap function in net/core/rtnetlink.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain data structure, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory by reading a Netlink message (bnc#978822).
- CVE-2016-3134: The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
validate certain offset fields, which allowed local users to gain
privileges or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via an
IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE setsockopt call (bnc#971126).
- CVE-2016-2847: fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel did not limit the amount of
unread data in pipes, which allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) by creating many pipes with non-default
sizes (bnc#970948).
- CVE-2016-2188: The iowarrior\_probe function in
drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970956).
- CVE-2016-3138: The acm\_probe function in drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB
device without both a control and a data endpoint descriptor
(bnc#970911).
- CVE-2016-3137: drivers/usb/serial/cypress\_m8.c in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB device without
both an interrupt-in and an interrupt-out endpoint descriptor, related
to the cypress\_generic\_port\_probe and cypress\_open functions
(bnc#970970).
- CVE-2016-3140: The digi\_port\_init function in
drivers/usb/serial/digi\_acceleport.c in the Linux kernel allowed
physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a
USB device descriptor (bnc#970892).
- CVE-2016-2186: The powermate\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/powermate.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970958).
- CVE-2016-2185: The ati\_remote2\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/ati\_remote2.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#971124).
- CVE-2016-3156: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles
destruction of device objects, which allowed guest OS users to cause a
denial of service (host OS networking outage) by arranging for a large
number of IP addresses (bnc#971360).
- CVE-2016-2184: The create\_fixed\_stream\_quirk function in
sound/usb/quirks.c in the snd-usb-audio driver in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference or double free, and system crash) via a
crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (bnc#971125).
- CVE-2016-3139: The wacom\_probe function in
drivers/input/tablet/wacom\_sys.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970909).
- CVE-2016-2143: The fork implementation in the Linux kernel on s390
platforms mishandles the case of four page-table levels, which allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to
arch/s390/include/asm/mmu\_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h
(bnc#970504).
- CVE-2016-2782: The treo\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=961512#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-01-12 12:08:49 UTC  ``` rh#1296466 Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security reported to RH:  A local kernel crash on invalid USB device requiring the visor driver was reported. The clie_5_attach function of the visor driver, which is called during the driver initialization process, expects an OUT-Bulk-Endpoint. Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers, which results in crash.  Patch discussion: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.usb.general/136030> or <http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=145259021123888&w=2>  Requires physical access to the system.

```

device without bulk-out endpoint is detected. This fix adds a check that
the device has proper configuration expected by the driver.

Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel was updated to receive various
security and bug fixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2016-4486: Fixed 4 byte information leak in net/core/rtnetlink.c
(bsc#978822).
- CVE-2016-3134: The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
validate certain offset fields, which allowed local users to gain
privileges or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via an
IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE setsockopt call (bnc#971126).
- CVE-2016-2847: fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel did not limit the amount of
unread data in pipes, which allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) by creating many pipes with non-default
sizes (bnc#970948).
- CVE-2016-2188: The iowarrior\_probe function in
drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970956).
- CVE-2016-3138: The acm\_probe function in drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB
device without both a control and a data endpoint descriptor
(bnc#970911).
- CVE-2016-3137: drivers/usb/serial/cypress\_m8.c in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB device without
both an interrupt-in and an interrupt-out endpoint descriptor, related
to the cypress\_generic\_port\_probe and cypress\_open functions
(bnc#970970).
- CVE-2016-3140: The digi\_port\_init function in
drivers/usb/serial/digi\_acceleport.c in the Linux kernel allowed
physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a
USB device descriptor (bnc#970892).
- CVE-2016-2186: The powermate\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/powermate.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970958).
- CVE-2016-2185: The ati\_remote2\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/ati\_remote2.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#971124).
- CVE-2016-3156: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles
destruction of device objects, which allowed guest OS users to cause a
denial of service (host OS networking outage) by arranging for a large
number of IP addresses (bnc#971360).
- CVE-2016-2184: The create\_fixed\_stream\_quirk function in
sound/usb/quirks.c in the snd-usb-audio driver in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference or double free, and system crash) via a
crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (bnc#971125).
- CVE-2016-3139: The wacom\_probe function in
drivers/input/tablet/wacom\_sys.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970909).
- CVE-2016-2143: The fork implementation in the Linux kernel on s390
platforms mishandled the case of four page-table levels, which allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to
arch/s390/include/asm/mmu\_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h
(bnc#970504).
- CVE-2016-2782: The treo\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that
lacks a (1) bulk-in or (2) interrupt-in endpoint (bnc#968670).
- CVE-2015-8816: The hub\_activate function in drivers/usb/core/hub.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly maintain a hub-interface data
structure, which allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid memory access and system crash) or possibly
have unspecified other impact by unplugging a USB hub device
(bnc#968010).
- CVE-2015-7566: The clie\_5\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c
in the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that
lacks a bulk-out endpoint (bnc#961512).
- CVE-2016-2549: sound/core/hrtimer.c in the Linux kernel did not prevent
recursive callback access, which allowed local users to cause a denial
of service (deadlock) via a crafted ioctl call (bnc#968013).
- CVE-2016-2547: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel employed a locking
approach that did not consider slave timer instances, which allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (race condition,
use-after-free, and system crash) via a crafted ioctl call (bnc#968011).
- CVE-2016-2548: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel retained certain
linked lists after a close or stop action, which allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted ioctl call,
related to the (1) snd\_timer\_close and (2) \_snd\_timer\_stop functions
(bnc#968012).
- CVE-2016-2546: sound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel used an incorrect
type of mutex, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(race condition, use-after-free, and system crash) via a crafted ioctl
call (bnc#967975).

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1480-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1480.106](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1480.106)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1296466#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-07 10:36:38 UTC  ``` A local kernel crash on invalid USB device requiring the visor driver was reported. The clie_5_attach function of the visor driver, which is called during the driver initialization process, expects an OUT-Bulk-Endpoint. Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers, which results in crash.   Vulnerable code:   **** CentOS-Kernel linux-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7 (drivers/usb/serial/visor.c)         ... 607 608	pipe = usb_sndbulkpipe(serial->dev, port->bulk_out_endpointAddress); 609	for (j = 0; j < ARRAY_SIZE(port->write_urbs); ++j) 610		port->write_urbs[j]->pipe = pipe;  /* if there is no configured OUT-bulk-endpoint, the kernel tries to dereference null-pointers */ 611 612	return 0; 613 }         ... ****  Reproducer can be found in original bug report: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1283371](show_bug.cgi?id=1283371 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2015-7566 Local RedHat Enterprise Linux DoS – RHEL 7.1 Kernel crashes on invalid USB device descriptors (visor driver) [local-DoS]")  Proposed upstream patch: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=145260786729359&w=2>  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cb3232138e37129e88240a98a1d2aba2187ff57c>  Bugtraq: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2016/Mar/58>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1296466#c1)  Vladis Dronov    2016-01-08 14:55:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ralf Spenneberg of OpenSource Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1296466#c2)  Vladis Dronov    2016-01-08 14:58:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and MRG-2. This has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

The clie\_5\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in the Linux
kernel through 4.4.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly
have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that lacks a
bulk-out endpoint.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the
Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the
device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service
(system crash).

OS-S Security Advisory 2016-09
Linux visor clie_5_attach Nullpointer Dereference

Date: March 4th, 2016
Authors: Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, Ralf Spenneberg
CVE: CVE-2015-7566
CVSS: 4.9 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
Title: Local RedHat Enterprise Linux DoS â?? RHEL 7.1 Kernel crashes on invalid
USB device descriptors (visor clie_5_attach driver)
Severity: Critical. The Kernel panics. A reboot is required.
Ease of Exploitation: Trivial
Vulnerability type: Wrong input validation
Products: RHEL 7.1 including all updates
Kernel-Version: 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64 (for debugging-purposes we used the
CentOS Kernel kernel-debuginfo-3.10.0-229.14.1.el7)
Vendor: Red Hat
Vendor contacted: November, 12th 2015
PDF of advisory: https://os-s.net/advisories/OSS-2016-09_visor_clie_5_attach.pdf

Abstract:
The Kernel 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64 crashes on presentation of a buggy USB
device requiring the visor (clie_5_attach) driver.

Detailed product description:
We confirmed the bug on the following system:
RHEL 7.1
Kernel 3.10.0-229.20.1.el7.x86_64
Further products or kernel versions have not been tested.
How reproducible: Always
Actual results: Kernel crashes.

Description:
The bug was found using the USB-fuzzing framework vUSBf from Sergej Schumilo
(github.com/schumilo) using the following device descriptor:

[*] Device-Descriptor
bLength:	0x12
bDescriptorType:	0x1
bcdUSB:	0x200
bDeviceClass:	0x3
bDeviceSubClass:	0x0
bDeviceProtocol:	0x0
bMaxPacketSize:	0x40

idProduct:	0x144
bcdDevice:	0x100
iManufacturer:	0x1
iProduct:	0x2
iSerialNumbers:	0x3
bNumConfigurations:	0x1

The clie_5_attach function of the visor driver, which is called during the
driver initialization process, expects an OUT-Bulk-Endpoint.
Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-
pointers.
This results in a crash of the system.

Proof of Concept:
For a proof of concept, we are providing an Arduino Leonardo firmware file. This
firmware will emulate the defective USB device.

avrdude -v -p ATMEGA32u4 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 57600 -U
flash:w:binary.hex

The firmware has been attached to this bug report.
To prevent the automated delivery of the payload, a jumper may be used to
connect port D3 and 3V3!

Severity and Ease of Exploitation:
The vulnerability can be easily exploited. Using our Arduino Leonardo firmware,
only physical access to the system is required.

Vendor Communication:
We contacted Red Hat on the November, 12th 2015.
This bug was fixed upstream. A CVE number was not assigned.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-wily](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-wily) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Wily for Trusty

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1296466#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-01-07 10:36:38 UTC  ``` A local kernel crash on invalid USB device requiring the visor driver was reported. The clie_5_attach function of the visor driver, which is called during the driver initialization process, expects an OUT-Bulk-Endpoint. Due to an incomplete sanity check, the visor driver tries to dereference null-pointers, which results in crash.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)
* [linux-image-4.2.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.2.0-34.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.2.0-34.39)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](/security/CVE-2015-7515))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe

buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for

[CVE-2015-1805](/security/CVE-2015-1805). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-0774](/security/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel's list poison feature did not

take into account the mmap\_min\_addr value. A local attacker could use this

to bypass the kernel's poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting

to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](/security/CVE-2016-0821))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel's

translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak

sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](/security/CVE-2016-2069))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly check the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-102-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-102.142](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-102.142)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# CVE-2016-1583

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1577.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1585.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1583 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1583)

#### Description

The ecryptfs\_privileged\_open function in fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (stack memory consumption) via vectors involving crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This problem affects SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 and 12, and openSUSE. SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 however does not have the precondition helper binary mount.ecryptfs\_private setuid root, so is not default impacted by this issue. Older SUSE Linux Enterprise versions do not includeecryptfs and so are not affected by this problem. As precondition for a working exploit is a setuid root mount.ecryptfs-private, as workaround you can deinstall ecryptfs-utils.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1020452](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1020452) [NEW], [1052256](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1052256) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [983143](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=983143) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [983144](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=983144) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

An update that solves 17 vulnerabilities and has 25 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP4 Realtime kernel was updated to receive
various security and bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2015-1339: Memory leak in the cuse\_channel\_release function in
fs/fuse/cuse.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service (memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other
impact by opening /dev/cuse many times (bnc#969356).
- CVE-2015-7566: The clie\_5\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c
in the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that
lacks a bulk-out endpoint (bnc#961512).
- CVE-2015-8551: The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86
system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allowed
local guest administrators to hit BUG conditions and cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) by leveraging a
system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI
device and a crafted sequence of XEN\_PCI\_OP\_\* operations, aka "Linux
pciback missing sanity checks (bnc#957990).
- CVE-2015-8552: The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86
system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allowed
local guest administrators to generate a continuous stream
of WARN messages and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by
leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X
capable physical PCI device and XEN\_PCI\_OP\_enable\_msi operations, aka
"Linux pciback missing sanity checks (bnc#957990).
- CVE-2015-8816: The hub\_activate function in drivers/usb/core/hub.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly maintain a hub-interface data
structure, which allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid memory access and system crash) or possibly
have unspecified
other impact by unplugging a USB hub device (bnc#968010).
- CVE-2016-2143: The fork implementation in the Linux kernel on s390
platforms mishandles the case of four page-table levels, which allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to
arch/s390/include/asm/mmu\_context.h and arch/s390/include/asm/pgalloc.h
(bnc#970504).
- CVE-2016-2184: The create\_fixed\_stream\_quirk function in
sound/usb/quirks.c in the snd-usb-audio driver in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference or double free, and system crash) via a
crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (bnc#971125).
- CVE-2016-2185: The ati\_remote2\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/ati\_remote2.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#971124).
- CVE-2016-2186: The powermate\_probe function in
drivers/input/misc/powermate.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970958).
- CVE-2016-2188: The iowarrior\_probe function in
drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970956).
- CVE-2016-2782: The treo\_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that
lacks a (1) bulk-in or (2) interrupt-in endpoint (bnc#968670).
- CVE-2016-2847: fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel did not limit the amount
of unread data in pipes, which allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) by creating many pipes with non-default
sizes (bnc#970948).
- CVE-2016-3137: drivers/usb/serial/cypress\_m8.c in the Linux kernel
allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB device without
both an interrupt-in and an interrupt-out endpoint descriptor, related
to the cypress\_generic\_port\_probe and cypress\_open functions
(bnc#970970).
- CVE-2016-3138: The acm\_probe function in drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c in
the Linux kernel allowed physically proximate attackers to cause a
denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a USB
device without both a control and a data endpoint descriptor
(bnc#970911).
- CVE-2016-3139: The wacom\_probe function in
drivers/input/tablet/wacom\_sys.c in the Linux kernel allowed physically
proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a USB
device descriptor (bnc#970909).
- CVE-2016-3140: The digi\_port\_init function in
drivers/usb/serial/digi\_acceleport.c in the Linux kernel allowed
physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value in a
USB device descriptor (bnc#970892).
- CVE-2016-3156: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles
destruction of device objects, which allowed guest OS users to cause a
denial of service (host OS networking outage) by arranging for a large
number of IP addresses (bnc#971360).

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic for Trusty

## Details

USN-2948-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Ubuntu 14.10 Linux kernel

backported to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. An incorrect reference counting

fix in the radeon driver introduced a regression that could cause a

system crash. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux

kernel's CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](/security/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux

Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect

system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](/security/CVE-2016-2085))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file

descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over

a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](/security/CVE-2016-2550))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the

amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](/security/CVE-2016-2847))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-8551 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8551)

#### Description

The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to hit BUG conditions and cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and a crafted sequence of XEN\_PCI\_OP\_\* operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity checks."

The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to generate a continuous stream of WARN messages and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and XEN\_PCI\_OP\_enable\_msi operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity checks."

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits

for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](/security/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate the interfaces and endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](/security/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not

correctly perform validation when handling IPT\_SO\_SET\_REPLACE events. A

local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2016-3134](/security/CVE-2016-3134))

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter

implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

([CVE-2016-3135](/security/CVE-2016-3135))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](/security/CVE-2015-7566))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat-

timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](/security/CVE-2015-8767))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for

the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2016-0723](/security/CVE-2016-0723))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA USB MIDI driver incorrectly

performed a double-free. A local attacker with physical access could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-2384](/security/CVE-2016-2384))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before

attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](/security/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced

Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing

of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](/security/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling

implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework,

resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](/security/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound

Architecture (ALSA) framework's timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](/security/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its

data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2016-2547](/security/CVE-2016-2547), [CVE-2016-2548](/security/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

framework's handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock

condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](/security/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate the endpoints reported by the

device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](/security/CVE-2016-2782))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [linux-image-4.2.0-1027-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.2.0-1027.35](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1027.35)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
