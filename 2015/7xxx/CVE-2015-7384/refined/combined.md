[![@rvagg](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495647?u=ac27cc8c4205b4f7e1e0f7fa243c885d3534ceee&v=4&size=48)](/rvagg)[rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)opened [on Sep 30, 2015](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3138#issue-109195414)

*Originally posted @ <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nodejs-sec/fSNEQiuof6I>*

## Description and CVSS Score

A bug exists in Node.js versions 4.0.0 to 4.1.1 whereby an external attacker can cause a denial of service. The severity of this issue is high (see CVSS scoring below) and users of the affected versions should plan to upgrade when a fix is made available.

* Versions 0.10 and 0.12 of Node.js are **\_not affected**\_.
* Versions 4.0.0, 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 of Node.js are **\_vulnerable**\_.
* Versions 1 and 2 of io.js are **\_not affected**\_ but remain unsupported and users of these versions are encouraged to migrate to Node.js v4 at their earliest convenience.
* Version 3 of io.js is **\_vulnerable**\_ and while io.js v3 is unsupported, a patch release with a fix will be made available some time next week. Users of io.js v3 are encouraged to migrate to Node.js v4 as a matter of priority.

Full details of this vulnerability are embargoed until a new v4.x release is made available on **Monday the 5th of October 2015**, UTC.

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3 Base Score:

| Metric | Score |
| --- | --- |
| **Base Score:** | **5.9 (Medium)** |
| **Base Vector:** | [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| **Attack Vector:** | Network (AV:N) |
| **Attack Complexity:** | Medium (AC:H) |
| **Privileges Required:** | None (PR:N) |
| **User Interaction:** | None (UI:N) |
| **Scope of Impact:** | Unchanged (S:U) |
| **Confidentiality Impact:** | None (C:N) |
| **Integrity Impact:** | None (I:N) |
| **Availability Impact:** | High (A:H) |

Refer to the [CVSS v3 Specification](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) for details on the meanings and application of the vector components.

[CVE-2015-7384](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gw56-f2ch-v6jj "CVE-2015-7384") is listed on the [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7384) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7384).

## Action and updates

A new v4.x release on **Monday the 5th of October 2015** will be made available with appropriate fixes for this vulnerability along with disclosure of the details of the bug to allow for complete impact assessment by users.

A new io.js v3.x release will be made on or after Monday the 5th of October 2015 for users having trouble migrating to Node.js v4, however this release does not indicate continued official support of io.js release lines.

## Contact and future updates

Please contact security@nodejs.org if you wish to report a vulnerability in Node.js.

Please subscribe to the low-volume announcement-only **nodejs-sec** mailing list at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nodejs-sec> to stay up to date with security vulnerabilities in Node.js and the projects maintained in the **nodejs** [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nodejs/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
