- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in IBM QRadar SIEM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected page within the IBM QRadar SIEM application. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts, likely through a user-supplied input field that is not properly sanitized, which is then stored on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into the QRadar system, which would likely require either compromised credentials or exploiting a separate vulnerability that would allow them to introduce code.
