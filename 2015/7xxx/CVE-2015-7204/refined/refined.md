Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7204:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox, before version 43.0, handles the storage of properties of unboxed objects in its JavaScript engine.  Specifically it fails to properly handle variable assignments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper storage of object properties
*   Lack of proper type checking or validation during JavaScript variable assignments.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on a user's system.
*   Application Crash: The vulnerability can cause the browser to crash, leading to a denial of service for the user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted JavaScript:** The attack vector is through specially crafted JavaScript code, which can be delivered via:
    *   Malicious websites: An attacker can create a website hosting the malicious script, and entice a user to visit it.
    *   Compromised websites: An attacker can inject the malicious script into a legitimate website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
*   **Ability to craft JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to write JavaScript that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious page for the exploit to work.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in Firefox 41.
*   The issue involves a failure in the implementation of unboxed objects and their property storage in the JavaScript engine.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during variable assignments in the Javascript execution, which leads to the exception "can't convert undefined to object".
