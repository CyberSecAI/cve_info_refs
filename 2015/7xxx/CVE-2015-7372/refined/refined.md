Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `layerstyle` parameter in the `al.php` script was not properly sanitized. This lack of sanitization allowed for the inclusion of arbitrary local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability stems from the ability to include and execute arbitrary local files due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `layerstyle` parameter in the `al.php` script.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious request to include a file using the `layerstyle` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request by manipulating the `layerstyle` parameter.
*   **File Placement** The attacker needs to place a file named `layerstyle.inc.php` in an arbitrary directory on the server or use older PHP versions to leverage other techniques like NULL-byte truncation.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in an area accessible without authentication.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Revive Adserver version 3.2.1 and earlier.
*   The fix was implemented in version 3.2.2, which includes a regular expression to validate the layerstyle parameter (`!preg_match('/^[a-z0-9-]{1,64}$/Di', $layerstyle)`), preventing directory traversal.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a high severity rating with a CVSSv2 score of 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).

**Summary**
The CVE-2015-7372 describes a Local File Inclusion vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the `layerstyle` parameter in `al.php`, allowing remote attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
