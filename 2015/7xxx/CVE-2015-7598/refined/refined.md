Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, focusing on CVE-2015-7598:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to subdirectories and executable modules within the installation directories of several SafeNet Authentication Service Agents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:**  Authenticated users, including guests, have excessive permissions (full control/modify/write) over the agent's installation directory. This allows them to alter files within the directories.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to modify or substitute executable modules that are later executed by a high-privileged user, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain full access to the compromised host by replacing legitimate executables with malicious ones. When an administrator or other privileged user runs the modified executable, the attacker’s code executes with that user’s higher privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation results in the attacker gaining full control over the target system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the target system where the vulnerable SafeNet Authentication Service agent is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the system, even with limited privileges (including guests).
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs access to the file system of the machine hosting the vulnerable agent to modify and replace executables.

**CVE-2015-7598 Specifics**
*   Specifically, CVE-2015-7598 is associated with the "SafeNet Authentication Service TokenValidator Proxy Agent" which is affected by the described weak ACL vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The content lists several affected SafeNet Authentication Service Agents including:
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service Windows Logon Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service IIS Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service TokenValidator Proxy Agent (CVE-2015-7598)
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service for Outlook Web App Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service for AD FS Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service for NPS Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service Remote Web Workplace Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service for Citrix Web Interface Agent
    *   SafeNet Authentication Service End User Software Tools for Windows
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The primary mitigation is to update the affected agent to the maintenance release provided by the vendor.
    *   A manual mitigation is also provided where the file system permissions can be altered to remove full control/modify/write permissions from Authenticated Users group and add the Administrators group with full access to the agent's installation folder.
    *   Ensure all child objects inherit the modified permissions.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was discovered in January 2016, with vendor notification, acknowledgement, and a security bulletin released later that month and public disclosure in March 2016.
