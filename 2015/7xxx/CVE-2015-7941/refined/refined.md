    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2015-7941",
      "Description": "libxml2 2.9.2 does not properly stop parsing invalid input, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and libxml2 crash) via crafted XML data to the (1) xmlParseEntityDecl or (2) xmlParseConditionalSections function in parser.c, as demonstrated by non-terminated entities."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "Improper handling of invalid XML input during parsing.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash)",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted XML data",
