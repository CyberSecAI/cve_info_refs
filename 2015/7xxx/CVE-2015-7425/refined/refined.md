- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the affected products' GUI components allowing an unauthenticated user to submit a specific URL pattern. This pattern triggers the execution of back-end functions, which should not be accessible without proper authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unauthenticated access: The GUI components fail to validate user identity before processing requests.
    - Command injection: The submitted URL pattern allows for the execution of arbitrary TSM server administrative commands.
    - Lack of input validation: The software does not properly sanitize or validate the URL pattern, leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access: Attackers can gain administrative access to the Tivoli Storage Manager server.
    - Data breach: Confidential information, including backup data, may be accessed.
    - Integrity violation: Backups and other data may be modified or corrupted.
    - System compromise: An attacker can perform backup and restore operations, as well as execute TSM server administrative commands, potentially leading to complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based: The attack is carried out by submitting a crafted URL pattern over the network to the vulnerable GUI component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GUI component.
    - No authentication required: No prior authentication or valid user credentials are required to perform the attack.
