Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of the `$ver` parameter obtained from the `$_GET` request in multiple files within the "double-opt-in-for-download" WordPress plugin. This unsanitized input is then directly incorporated into SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin directly embeds user-supplied data from the `ver` GET parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or use of prepared statements. This is present in:
    *   `double-opt-in-for-download/public/includes/class-doifd-download.php` at lines 61 and 110
    *  `double-opt-in-for-download/public/includes/class-doifd-landing-page.php` at line 71.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the WordPress database.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Attackers could also modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain administrative control over the WordPress site.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The advisory mentions blind SQL injection, meaning an attacker might not directly see the results of their queries, but can infer information by observing changes in behavior (e.g. response times) or application state.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `ver` parameter in the URL. For example, by crafting a malicious SQL statement within the `ver` parameter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. No specific user privileges are mentioned as needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE:**
*   The advisory provides specific file paths and line numbers where the vulnerability exists.
*   It explicitly mentions the vulnerability is a **blind SQL injection**.
*   It names the vulnerable parameter as `$ver`.
