Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7568:

**CVE-2015-7568:**

*   **Root Cause:** Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection. The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the password reset functionality.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection via the `token` parameter in the password reset functionality and the `userToken` parameter when setting a new password, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can gain full access to the Yeager CMS database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   An attacker can change user passwords, including the administrator's password, resulting in a complete compromise of the CMS.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `token` parameter in the URL: `http://<host>/yeager/?action=passwordreset&token=<SQL Injection>`.
    *   By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `userToken` parameter in a JSON payload in the URL: `http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"<SQL Injection>"}}]`
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. This means an unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability can be used to reset any user's password if the attacker knows the user's email address. The email can be obtained through social engineering or by leveraging this same SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit this by crafting SQL injection in the `userToken` to reset the password instantly.
*   The vulnerability was present in Yeager CMS version 1.2.1 and fixed in version 1.3.

In summary, CVE-2015-7568 is a critical unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability in Yeager CMS that allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized database access and reset user passwords.
