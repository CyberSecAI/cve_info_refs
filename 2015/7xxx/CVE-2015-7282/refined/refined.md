The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7282.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ReadyNet WRT300N-DD router uses static source ports for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use of insufficiently random values for DNS queries (CWE-330).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause WRT300N-DD LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs the ability to spoof DNS responses. This typically requires a position on the network that allows the attacker to intercept and modify DNS traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to intercept and spoof DNS responses, which requires a position on the network that allows the attacker to intercept and modify DNS traffic.
