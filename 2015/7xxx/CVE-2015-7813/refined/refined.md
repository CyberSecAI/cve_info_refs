Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the fact that certain unimplemented hypercalls (specifically `HYPERVISOR_physdev_op` and most suboperations of `HYPERVISOR_hvm_op`) on ARM architecture Xen hypervisor would generate log messages to the hypervisor console without any rate limiting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of rate limiting on console logging of unimplemented hypercalls.
- Unimplemented hypercalls were still generating output, creating an avenue for exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest could repeatedly trigger these unimplemented hypercalls.
- This could lead to excessive logging to the hypervisor console.
- This can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest operating system can make the vulnerable hypercall.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest VM on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the guest to trigger hypercalls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to ARM architecture Xen installations.
- The issue can be mitigated by rate-limiting or suppressing the warning log messages using the `loglvl` hypervisor command-line option, or by controlling which guest kernels are loaded into the VM so they do not call these hypercalls.
- The advisory notes that even if the guest kernel is controlled by the host, an untrusted guest administrator could still potentially exploit the vulnerability unless further steps are taken to prevent them from running code at kernel privilege (e.g., disabling loadable modules).
