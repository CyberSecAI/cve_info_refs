Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Adobe Acrobat Reader DC handles URLs passed to the `app.launchURL` function. A specially crafted URL passed to this function can force a command to be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of URLs passed to the `app.launchURL` function leads to command execution.
- The vulnerability bypasses restrictions on JavaScript API execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the process running Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system (take control of the affected system)

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL and passing it to the vulnerable `app.launchURL` function. This is likely through a crafted PDF document.
- Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easier to target.
- Network-based attack: The attacker can leverage the network to deliver malicious PDF to a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted PDF document containing the malicious URL.
- No authentication is needed
