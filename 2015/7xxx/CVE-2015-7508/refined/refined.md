Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7508:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `bmp_decode_rle` function of the `libnsbmp` library, which decodes run-length encoded (RLE) BMP image data. The function calculates `pixels_left` to determine how many pixels can be written in a row. However, the calculation is flawed, particularly for the last row.  This incorrect calculation allows the RLE expansion logic to write past the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap overflow. The `bmp_decode_rle` function can write beyond the allocated memory for the bitmap when handling RLE encoded data, specifically during the expansion of the last row.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap overflow can lead to memory corruption. This can result in a variety of issues, such as:
    *   **Segmentation Fault:** The provided example shows a segmentation fault, indicating the program is attempting to access memory it is not allowed to access.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In more severe cases, heap overflows can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption may crash the application, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious BMP File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted BMP image file containing RLE-encoded data designed to trigger the overflow in `bmp_decode_rle`. This means that an attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a malicious BMP file to an application using the vulnerable version of libnsbmp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted BMP file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libnsbmp` library. This can be achieved in various scenarios, like if the application is a:
    *   Web browser that processes images
    *   Image viewer
    *   Any other software that uses the `libnsbmp` library to decode BMP files.

**Technical Details:**

*   The core issue resides in how `pixels_left` is calculated within the `bmp_decode_rle` function. This variable is used to limit the number of pixels written by the RLE expansion logic, which expands encoded pixel data based on the provided RLE bytes.
*   The vulnerability occurs when the RLE data expands beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, as the last row of pixels is being decoded. The logic uses `bmp->width` and `bmp->height` to manage pixel data, but the `pixels_left` calculation can be inaccurate, causing an out-of-bounds write during pixel expansion.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a proof of concept (`heap.bmp`) and a GDB script (`heap.py`) that demonstrates how to trigger the heap overflow.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in the git HEAD of the libnsbmp project.
*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2015-7507 (an out-of-bounds read in `libnsbmp`), but this is a separate vulnerability.
