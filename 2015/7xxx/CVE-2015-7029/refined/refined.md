- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption issue existed in DNS data parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient bounds checking during DNS data parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the parsing of DNS data, implying network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS data to the affected AirPort base stations. This would typically require the attacker to be on the same network or have the ability to route traffic to the device.
