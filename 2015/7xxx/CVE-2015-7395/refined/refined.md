- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control within IBM Maximo Asset Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not properly restrict access to work orders based on user permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can change work orders that they should not have access to, potentially leading to compromised data integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker, having obtained valid credentials, can exploit the vulnerability by directly interacting with the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the system, therefore an authenticated user.
