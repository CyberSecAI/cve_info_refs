- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The encrypted password in the `setenv.sh` file is always the same, making it easy to decrypt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak encryption of user credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user on the CMA install machine can obtain other CMA user's encrypted usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the CMA install machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the server where IBM Capacity Management Analytics is installed and be able to read the `setenv.sh` file.
