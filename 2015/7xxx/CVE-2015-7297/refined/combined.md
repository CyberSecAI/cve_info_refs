        This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability found in Joomla versions
        3.2 up to 3.4.4. The vulnerability exists in the Content History administrator
        component in the core of Joomla. Triggering the SQL injection makes it possible
        to retrieve active Super User sessions. The cookie can be used to login to the
        Joomla administrator backend. By creating a new template file containing our
        payload, remote code execution is made possible.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Joomla com\_contenthistory Error-Based SQL Injection

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Joomla com\_contenthistory Error-Based SQL Injection

Disclosed
10/22/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in Joomla versions 3.2
through 3.4.4 in order to either enumerate usernames and password hashes.

#### Author(s)

* Asaf Orpani
* bperry
* Nixawk

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/auxiliary/gather/joomla_contenthistory_sqli.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/auxiliary/gather/joomla_contenthistory_sqli.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use auxiliary/gather/joomla_contenthistory_sqli
msf auxiliary(joomla_contenthistory_sqli) > show actions
    ...actions...
msf auxiliary(joomla_contenthistory_sqli) > set ACTION < action-name >
msf auxiliary(joomla_contenthistory_sqli) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf auxiliary(joomla_contenthistory_sqli) > run
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security

# Joomla Content History SQLi Remote Code Execution

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Joomla Content History SQLi Remote Code Execution

Disclosed
10/23/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability found in Joomla versions
3.2 up to 3.4.4. The vulnerability exists in the Content History administrator
component in the core of Joomla. Triggering the SQL injection makes it possible
to retrieve active Super User sessions. The cookie can be used to login to the
Joomla administrator backend. By creating a new template file containing our
payload, remote code execution is made possible.

#### Author(s)

* Asaf Orpani
* xistence <xistence@0x90.nl>

#### Platform

PHP

#### Architectures

php

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/unix/webapp/joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/unix/webapp/joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/unix/webapp/joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce
msf exploit(joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(joomla_contenthistory_sqli_rce) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Collect and share all the information you need to conduct a successful and efficient penetration test](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

[Free Metasploit Pro Trial](/try/metasploit-pro/)
[View All Features](/products/metasploit/features/)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

– Jim O’Gorman | President, Offensive Security
