Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7323:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Insufficient authorization checks in the Junos Pulse Secure Meeting Java fat client (meetingAppSun.jar).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Java fat client allows users to bypass meeting authorization controls.
- Specifically, it does not enforce the need for a meeting password or invitation link when accessing a meeting via the Java fat client.
- The vulnerability lies in the client-side logic, as the web browser interface correctly enforces meeting authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to "secure" meetings.
- Potential exposure of sensitive information discussed or shared during the meeting.
- Attackers can join meetings without being invited or knowing the password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable Java fat client (meetingAppSun.jar).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid session ID (DSID). This can be acquired either by:
    -  Having an invitation link to *any* meeting.
    -  Having a valid account that allows logging into Junos Pulse via the HTTP login form.
- The attacker needs the meeting ID, which is a 7-8 digit number. This can be obtained either via brute force or potentially through CVE-2015-7322.
- The attacker needs to know the domain/IP of the Junos Pulse server.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
- The provided content gives a detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability using a java command-line example that takes the session ID, meeting ID and server information to gain access to a meeting.
- The content identifies the affected version, the specific component affected, and provides the CVSS score. It also includes a disclosure timeline and vendor acknowledgement.
- It clearly states that the vulnerability is only present when using the Java fat client and not when accessing a meeting via the web browser.
