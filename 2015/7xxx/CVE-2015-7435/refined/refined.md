Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that a `BackURL` prefixed with whitespace characters bypasses the CAF (Cognos Application Framework) validation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The CAF validation mechanism does not properly handle whitespace characters before the URL.
- URL manipulation: Attackers can potentially control the destination URL by injecting a whitespace prefixed `BackURL`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is the potential for unauthorized redirection. Although the CVSS vector indicates "Low" integrity impact (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N), this could potentially lead to further attacks like phishing or other malicious activity via the manipulated redirect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating a `BackURL` parameter by prefixing it with whitespace characters.
- The attack is local and requires low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `BackURL` parameter within the context of the application. This suggests they must be a user with at least "low" privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides a good summary of the vulnerability, including the root cause, impact, and attack vector. It also provides links to obtain fixes.
- The CVSS score indicates a relatively low severity, but it should still be addressed to prevent potential misuse of the redirect mechanism.
- The provided CVSS vector is: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N). The vulnerability requires local access (AV:L), High attack complexity (AC:H), and low privilege user (PR:L). The user interaction is None (UI:N), the scope is unchanged (S:U), there's no confidentiality impact (C:N), but low integrity impact (I:L), and no availability impact (A:N).
