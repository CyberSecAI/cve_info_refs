Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in libsndfile due to incorrect management of `headindex` and `headend` values while parsing specially crafted AIFF headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow: A specially crafted AIFF file header can manipulate the `headindex` value, causing `memcpy` to write beyond the allocated buffer in the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Denial of service: By overflowing the heap, an attacker could cause libsndfile to crash.
-  Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts the overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malformed AIFF files.
-  Attackers can deliver the crafted AIFF files through various means including:
    -  Email attachments
    -  Websites that process audio
    -  Audio servers
    -  File uploads

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to provide a specially crafted AIFF file to the vulnerable software (libsndfile).
-  No authentication is required.
-  The attacker can be a remote user who provides the malformed file.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `aiff.c` file within the libsndfile source code.
- By manipulating fields in the AIFF header, the attacker can control the `headindex` value.
-  The `header_read` function uses this `headindex` value in a `memcpy` operation: `memcpy (ptr, psf->header + psf->headindex, bytes);`
- By manipulating the `headindex` value, an attacker can cause the `memcpy` to write outside of the bounds of the allocated `psf->header` buffer on the heap, leading to a crash or other impact.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was triggered via a specially crafted AIFF header, allowing the attacker to overwrite heap memory by controlling index values.
-  The `psf` structure allocated on the heap can be overwritten, including its `virtual_io` flag and `vio.seek` function pointer, which is then used by subsequent logic, allowing for control of the instruction pointer and RDX register.
-  This vulnerability affects several software products that use libsndfile.
