- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Improper Ethernet frame padding in Siemens RuggedCom ROS-based devices. Instead of padding with zeros, the device used data from a known area of memory.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Sensitive Information Uncleared Before Release (CWE-226)
- **Impact of Exploitation**: Information leakage. An attacker could passively observe leaked data from the device's memory included in the padding of Ethernet frames.
- **Attack Vectors**: The attacker needs to be the receiver of the packet containing the leaked data or be positioned along the network path where the packet is transmitted (e.g., on a local network without encryption).
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to receive the network traffic from the vulnerable device. This can be achieved through being the intended recipient of the traffic or through a position along the network path. No specific technical skill is required beyond being able to capture network packets.
