Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inconsistent authorization checks in Apache Hive. Specifically, some partition-level operations do not properly authorize privileges of the parent table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The core issue is that privilege checks are not performed correctly. When a user attempts an operation at the partition level, the system does not check if they have the necessary permissions on the parent table. This leads to a bypass of table-level access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on partitions even if they don't have the required privileges on the parent table. This could lead to data manipulation or access to information that should be restricted.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** The vulnerability directly bypasses intended access controls defined at the table level, compromising the overall security of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Partition Level Operations:** The attacker would need to target specific partition-level operations in Hive that are not properly checking parent table privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hive User:** The attacker needs to be a valid Hive user with some level of access to the system.
*   **Knowledge of Hive Structure:** They need to be aware of the structure of tables and partitions in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Execute Hive Operations:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute commands or queries that target partition-level operations.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
Yes, the provided content provides more detail than the typical CVE description.  It describes specific mitigation steps, the affected versions and the vendor involved which is not usually included in the CVE description itself.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue affects Apache Hive clusters protected by both Ranger and SqlStdHiveAuthorization.
*   A patch and a workaround are available. The workaround involves adding a hook to `hive-site.xml`.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in all affected branches, meaning future releases should not have this problem.
