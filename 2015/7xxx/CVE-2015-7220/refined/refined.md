    "source": "bugzilla.mozilla.org_2909b971_20250126_082000.html",
    "root_cause": "The `XDRBuffer::grow` function in `js/src/vm/Xdr.cpp` can cause an integer overflow when calculating the new buffer size. This leads to the allocation of a buffer that is too small, and subsequent writes beyond its bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Memory safety bug"

    "impact": "Allocation of too-small buffers and out-of-bounds writes. This can potentially lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation requires triggering the vulnerable code path. While it is suggested that it may be possible to exploit this via a crafted web page with extremely large javascript files, it is considered difficult to trigger this from web content.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to find a way to cause `XDRBuffer::grow` to be called with a size `n` such that the subsequent calculations overflow."
