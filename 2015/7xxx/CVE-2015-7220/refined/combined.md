## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

XDRBuffer::grow (js/src/vm/Xdr.cpp, current trunk) can cause an overflow when computing the new buffer size. If this happens, grow allocates a buffer that is much too small, and its callers write far beyond its end:
27: bool
28: XDRBuffer::grow(size\_t n)
29: {
30: MOZ\_ASSERT(n > size\_t(limit - cursor));
31:
32: const size\_t MIN\_CAPACITY = 8192;
33: size\_t offset = cursor - base;
34: size\_t newCapacity = mozilla::RoundUpPow2(offset + n);
35: if (newCapacity < MIN\_CAPACITY)
36: newCapacity = MIN\_CAPACITY;
37: if (isUint32Overflow(newCapacity)) {
38: js::gc::AutoSuppressGC suppressGC(cx());
39: JS\_ReportErrorNumber(cx(), GetErrorMessage, nullptr, JSMSG\_TOO\_BIG\_TO\_ENCODE);
40: return false;
41: }
42:
43: void\* data = js\_realloc(base, newCapacity);
44: if (!data) {
45: ReportOutOfMemory(cx());
46: return false;
47: }
48: base = static\_cast<uint8\_t\*>(data);
49: cursor = base + offset;
50: limit = base + newCapacity;
51: return true;
52: }
The problem occurs on 32-bit platforms only. If offset + n on line 34 exceeds 0x80000001, RoundUpPow2 returns 1 (1 << 32) under Windows 32-bit (note that this is actually undefined per C++11 s.5.8(1)). Lines 35-6 then calculate newCapacity==MIN\_CAPACITY (8192). The test on line 37 is useless because newCapacity has already overflowed. Line 43 then allocates the tiny buffer, line 49 computes a cursor well outside the buffer's bounds, and the function returns true. Its caller then uses cursor to write into the buffer.
XDRBuffer appears to be used to serialize compiled javascripts. Is it possible for a web page to contain one or more gigantic javascripts that would invoke this bug?

AFAIK, XDR is only used for the JS of the browser at the moment, and in the JS Shell. In the worst case it might be available to Addons, but as we do not have a bytecode cache for the web pages yet, thus this is probably hard to use it as a first vector of attack.
Still, this is a valid bug and we should fix it.

Line 35 could still overflow if n is very large. Is it possible to use CheckedInt here?

Unless we have a hard guarantee that n < INT32\_MAX, I think we need (MAX\_CAPACITY - offset < n) and add MOZ\_ASSERT(offset <= MAX\_CAPACITY).

Oh, thanks for catching this issue. I guess I was too focus on the
RoundUpPow2 assertion that I did not noticed this one.
Luke, we have inputs where "n" is computed from some inputs, so I think the
second approach is the safest.
About CheckedInt, this sounds like a good idea, but it does not provide an
easy way to set a different upper-bound, thus we will still have to check
against RoundUpPow2 limit case.

nsDeque::GrowCapacity (xpcom\glue\nsDeque.cpp) does not properly check for overflow. This can cause it to allocate a buffer that is too small to contain the deque's elements, some of which then are written to memory that the deque does not own.
Details:
--------
If the deque's existing capacity |mCapacity| has the range [0x10000000, 0x1fffffff] (1-2 GB), then line 166 (below) computes a valid |theNewSize| with the range [0x40000000, 0x7ffffffc] and the tests on lines 167-70 pass:
163: bool
164: nsDeque::GrowCapacity()
165: {
166: int32\_t theNewSize = mCapacity << 2;
167: NS\_ASSERTION(theNewSize > mCapacity, "Overflow");
168: if (theNewSize <= mCapacity) {
169: return false;
170: }
Control passes to line 171, which multiples |theNewSize| by |sizeof(void\*)|, which is 4 on x86 architectures. The resulting values [0x100000000, 0x1fffffff0] overflow |size\_t| on x86 architectures, and are truncated to [0, 0xfffffff0] [1]:
171: void\*\* temp = (void\*\*)malloc(theNewSize \* sizeof(void\*));
172: if (!temp) {
173: return false;
174: }
Line 171 can allocate sizes near the lower end of this range, so then control passes to lines 181-82, which write beyond the end of the buffer:
175:
176: //Here's the interesting part: You can't just move the elements
177: //directly (in situ) from the old buffer to the new one.
178: //Since capacity has changed, the old origin doesn't make
179: //sense anymore. It's better to resequence the elements now.
180:
181: memcpy(temp, mData + mOrigin, sizeof(void\*) \* (mCapacity - mOrigin));
182: memcpy(temp + (mCapacity - mOrigin), mData, sizeof(void\*) \* mOrigin);
...
Any elements added later are also written beyond the end of the buffer.
[1] There is no overflow on x64 architectures, where |sizeof(size\_t)| == 8.

Attached patch

[Sanity check byte size when growing deque](attachment.cgi?id=8656297&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8656297&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1199400&attachment=8656297)

This takes a very straightforward approach of asserting the byte size has not overflowed.

I would feel way more comfortable about this function (and these checks in particular) if mCapacity and company were of unsigned type.
Or perhaps some of these calculations could use mozilla/CheckedInt.h.

I think CheckedInt would make this clearer, because really what you're trying to do here is ensure that the amount for malloc doesn't overflow, and checking against the previous amount that you malloc'd is kind of a roundabout way of doing that. (I think this way works, but it's not particularly obvious that overflow, etc. work out in your favor.)

This updates nsDeque to use size\_t for its members that track sizes and
offsets. Method params and return values are updated as well, this required
a few changes outside of xpcom that use |GetSize|.

Because of the change to the post-decrement operator, you'll get an nullptr exception by writing:
for (nsDequeIterator it = somensDequeObject.End(); it >= somensDequeObject.Begin(); foo = \*it--) ...

The good news is that nsDequeIterator seems to be completely unused, so...

That is good news, because it's a bit ugly. Still, it should either work correctly or get removed from the codebase.

We should really just delete the iterator class, it's not used and it doesn't conform to standard concepts of iteration (nsDeque::End() is actually a valid element).

Ya. That's the bit of ugly I was thinking of....

Going to update with:
- New patch: Removing the iterator class, it's untested, unused, and odd
- Updated switch to size\_t patch removing modassign, updating PushFront, updating bizarro modulus to standard modulus
- CheckedInt should be basically the same
- Add some tests for stuff that would have been broken

So now that I've seen part 2, which I'm not sure I have the mental capacity to think through the repercussions of doing, WDYT about the simpler fix of just applying CheckedInt here? Something like:
CheckedInt<int32\_t> newCapacity = mCapacity;
newCapacity \*= 4;
// I think the current patch is correct in its checks, but it'd be
// nice to have this check in here for completeness.
if (!newCapacity.isValid()) {
return false;
}
CheckedInt<int32\_t> newByteSize = newCapacity;
newByteSize \*= sizeof(void\*);
// Verify that newByteSize.isValid();
// Allocate and store mCapacity as this current patch has.

As suggested for part 2, I'm not sure I have the mental capacity right now to think through all the effects this change would require. Let's try just applying CheckedInt<int32\_t> in part 2 and see where that gets us.

Okay, we'll hold off on switching to size\_t. I'll update the patches accordingly.

(In reply to Andrew McCreight [:mccr8] from [comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=1199400#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overflow in nsDeque::GrowCapacity can cause memory-safety bug"))
> I'm going to mark this sec-moderate because getting a contiguous 1GB
> allocation on a 32-bit system is not very plausible.
I was curious about how easy it is to get a 1GB allocation on x86 FF. So I started FF 40.0 debug on Win7 SP1 x64. Then I set breakpoints on some random instantiations of |new char []| and the like, attached the debugger to FF, and loaded mozilla.org. It breakpointed at nsPNGEncoder::AddImageFrame line 292:
uint8\_t\* row = new uint8\_t[aWidth \* 4];
I doctored aWidth to 0x10000000, stepped it, and (a bit to my surprise), it returned row = 0x80000000. I was then able to use the debugger to change the values of the bytes at 0x80000000 and 0xbfffffff, so it definitely worked.
That said, I suppose this would be more difficult if I had used FF for awhile before setting the breakpoint, and it'd certainly be more difficult on an x86 OS (but how many people run those nowadays?).

If we want to uplift this, part 1 is the main piece. It should be reasonably straightforward to backport.

## Details

Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman,

Eric Rahm, Robert Kaiser, Harald Kirschner, and Michael Henretty

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7201](/security/CVE-2015-7201), [CVE-2015-7202](/security/CVE-2015-7202))

Ronald Crane discovered three buffer overflows through code inspection.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7203](/security/CVE-2015-7203), [CVE-2015-7220](/security/CVE-2015-7220), [CVE-2015-7221](/security/CVE-2015-7221))

Cajus Pollmeier discovered a crash during javascript variable assignments

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2015-7204](/security/CVE-2015-7204))

Ronald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7205](/security/CVE-2015-7205))

It was discovered that it is possible to read cross-origin URLs following

a redirect if performance.getEntries() is used with an iframe to host a

page. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin

restrictions. ([CVE-2015-7207](/security/CVE-2015-7207))

It was discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to be set in

cookies. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cookie

injection attacks on some web servers. ([CVE-2015-7208](/security/CVE-2015-7208))

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC when closing channels in

some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7210](/security/CVE-2015-7210))

Abdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that hash symbol is incorrectly handled

when parsing data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

conduct URL spoofing attacks. ([CVE-2015-7211](/security/CVE-2015-7211))

Abhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large

textures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7212](/security/CVE-2015-7212))

Ronald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format

video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7213](/security/CVE-2015-7213))

Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using

data: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

obtain sensitive information and read local files. ([CVE-2015-7214](/security/CVE-2015-7214))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in error events

in web workers. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-7215](/security/CVE-2015-7215))

Gustavo Grieco discovered that the file chooser crashed on malformed

images due to flaws in the Jasper library. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-7216](/security/CVE-2015-7216), [CVE-2015-7217](/security/CVE-2015-7217))

Stuart Larsen discoverd two integer underflows when handling malformed

HTTP/2 frames in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these

to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2015-7218](/security/CVE-2015-7218),

[CVE-2015-7219](/security/CVE-2015-7219))

Gerald Squelart discovered an integer underflow in the libstagefright

library when parsing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7222](/security/CVE-2015-7222))

Kris Maglione discovered a mechanism where web content could use

WebExtension APIs to execute code with the privileges of a particular

WebExtension. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website with a vulnerable extension installed, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information or conduct

cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2015-7223](/security/CVE-2015-7223))
