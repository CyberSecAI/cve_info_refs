  "vulnerability_id": "CVE-2015-7370",
  "vulnerability": "Reflected XSS",
  "description": "The open-flash-chart.swf file, used by the VideoAds plugin in Revive Adserver, was vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks on the id and data-file parameters. This file was included via the third party LGPLv2 graphing library, Open Flash Chart 2, which appears to be currently unmaintained.",

  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters. They need to trick a user into clicking this malicious URL.",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerable open-flash-chart.swf file was part of the third-party Open Flash Chart 2 library which was unmaintained. The Revive Adserver team fixed the vulnerability and published a GitHub repository for the library, including the vulnerability fixes."
