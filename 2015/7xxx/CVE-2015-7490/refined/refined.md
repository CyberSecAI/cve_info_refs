Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

* The vulnerability stems from an insecure transmission issue in IBM InfoSphere Information Server. Specifically, a malicious user with a valid login can modify their user cookie to impersonate another user, potentially gaining unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Transmission:** The core weakness is the lack of proper protection of user identity within the transport layer, allowing for cookie manipulation.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The vulnerability enables a malicious user to change their user cookie, which is used for authentication and authorization, to another user ID.
*   **Improper Session Management:**  The system's session management appears to be flawed, allowing the cookie modification to be effective for impersonation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to information and resources that are accessible to the impersonated user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By assuming the identity of a more privileged user, the attacker could escalate their privileges within the system, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, with the attacker exploiting the vulnerability through their authenticated connection to the InfoSphere Information Server.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attack involves manipulating user cookies within the application's transport layer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account within IBM InfoSphere Information Server to initiate the attack.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the system hosting IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
*   **Understanding of Cookie Structure:** The attacker needs an understanding of the cookie mechanism to manipulate it effectively.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as "Transport Layer Protection: Insecure Transmission."
*   The provided content references both CVE-2015-7490 and APAR JR54787 which addresses the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM InfoSphere Information Server (8.5, 8.7, 9.1, 11.3, and 11.5).
*   Fixes for the vulnerability involve applying specific fix packs and security patches.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a "Medium" issue by security scanning software.
