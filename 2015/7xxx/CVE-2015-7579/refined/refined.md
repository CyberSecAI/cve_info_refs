  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-7579",
  "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the rails-html-sanitizer gem 1.0.2 for Ruby on Rails 4.2.x and 5.x allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an HTML entity that is mishandled by the `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` class.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` class, when used by Action View's `strip_tags` function, incorrectly unescapes already escaped HTML entities. This allows an attacker to bypass sanitization and inject malicious HTML if the output is used with `raw` or `html_safe`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into a web application, leading to potential execution of malicious code in a user's browser.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input containing escaped HTML entities to a vulnerable application.",
