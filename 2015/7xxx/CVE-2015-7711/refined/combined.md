ATutor <= 2.2 (popuphelp.php) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<http://www.atutor.ca/>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.2 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the /popuphelp.php script:

26.     if ($_GET['h']) {
27.         $h = $_GET['h'];
28.
29.         if (is_string($_GET['h'])) { // just a AT_HELP code with no prefix
30.             $msg->printHelps($h);

User input passed through the "h" GET parameter is not properly sanitized before
