```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the `popuphelp.php` script where user-supplied input from the "h" GET parameter is not sanitized before being used in the `Message::printHelps()` method.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page viewed by the victim. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the "h" GET parameter, which is then reflected back in the response.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it. The user must be logged into the vulnerable ATutor application.
