{
  "CVE-2015-7549": {
    "description": "The QEMU emulator built with PCI MSI-X support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue. This occurs when the controller attempts to write to the Pending Bit Array (PBA) memory region because the MSI-X MMIO support did not define the .write method.",
    "root_cause": "The MSI-X MMIO support did not define the .write method, leading to a null pointer dereference when the controller tried to write to the PBA memory region.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation of the vulnerability by a privileged attacker within a guest virtual machine."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged attacker inside the guest VM is required to trigger the vulnerability."
