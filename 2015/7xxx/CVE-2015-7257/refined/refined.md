### Vulnerability Summary:
The ZTE ADSL ZXV10 W300 modem is vulnerable to insufficient authorization controls, specifically in the password change functionality. This vulnerability allows any non-admin user to change the admin user's password.

### Root Cause:
The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks in the password change functionality, allowing non-administrative users to modify other users' passwords, including the admin password.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:
Insufficient authorization controls.

### Impact of Exploitation:
Exploitation allows a non-admin user to change the admin password, leading to complete compromise of the device.

### Attack Vectors:
1.  Log in as a non-admin user (e.g., 'support').
2.  Access the password change page (e.g., `http://<IP>/password.htm`).
3.  Intercept the request and modify the 'username' parameter from the current user to 'admin'.
4.  Submit the request with a new password. The old password is not required.
5.  Log in as the 'admin' user with the new password.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
The attacker needs to be able to log in to the device as a non-admin user and have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
