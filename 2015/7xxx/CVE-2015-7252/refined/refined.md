  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `errorpage` parameter of the `webproc` CGI module in ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A routers does not properly neutralize user-supplied input when generating web pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the script in the errorpage parameter, and then convinces a user to visit that URL. The router reflects this script in the response, and the user's browser executes it."
