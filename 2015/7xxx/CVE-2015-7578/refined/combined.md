# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7579.  Versions Affected:  1.0.2 Not affected:       1.0.0, 1.0.1 Fixed Versions:     1.0.3  Impact ------ Due to the way that `Rails::Html::FullSanitizer` is implemented, if an attacker passes an already escaped HTML entity to the input of Action View's `strip_tags` these entities will be unescaped what may cause a XSS attack if used in combination with `raw` or `html_safe`.  For example:      strip_tags("&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;")  Would generate:      <script>alert('XSS')</script>  After the fix it will generate:      &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- If you can't upgrade, please use the following monkey patch in an initializer that is loaded before your application:  ``` $ cat config/initializers/strip_tags_fix.rb class ActionView::Base   def strip_tags(html)     self.class.full_sanitizer.sanitize(html)   end end ```  Patches ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * Do-not-unescape-already-escaped-HTML-entities.patch  Credits ------- Thank you to Arthur Neves from GitHub and Spyros Livathinos from Zendesk for reporting the problem and working with us to fix it. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-01-23 23:00:27 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-25 15:00:41 UTC  ``` CRD: 2016-01-25 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-26 07:25:56 UTC  ``` public at <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/205> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c4)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 10:25:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 663375](attachment.cgi?id=663375 "test/reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=663375&action=edit "test/reproducer") test/reproducer ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c5)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-27 10:34:38 UTC  ``` regarding openSUSE, this package is in Leap ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c6)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-27 12:56:55 UTC  ``` Jürgen, I saw your submission <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356270>  Could you check if fix for [bug 963327](show_bug.cgi?id=963327 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2015-7579: rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer: XSS vulnerability in rails-html-sanitizer") and [bug 963328](show_bug.cgi?id=963328 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2015-7580: rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer: XSS via whitelist sanitizer") are missing? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c7)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-01-27 14:00:10 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (963327) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/356287> 42.1 / rubygem-rails-html-sanitizer ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=963327#c9)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-01-28 09:29:05 UTC  ``` all submissions done.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Define a less permissive list of tags and attributes

```
And use it by default.

The new sanitizer were being a lot more permissive that we had in Rails
until the version 4.2.

This was also allowing arbritary data attributes by default what can
lead to CSRF and XSS attacks.

Now data attributes need to be explicitly allowed.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-7576 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7576)

#### Description

The http\_basic\_authenticate\_with method in actionpack/lib/action\_controller/metal/http\_authentication.rb in the Basic Authentication implementation in Action Controller in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not use a constant-time algorithm for verifying credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by measuring timing differences.
