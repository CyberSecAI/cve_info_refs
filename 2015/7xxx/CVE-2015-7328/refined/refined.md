- **Root cause of vulnerability**: During the initial installation and configuration of Puppet Enterprise, the generated CA key is created with world-readable permissions. This is a temporary condition that is corrected during the configuration/bootstrapping steps.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The CA key is left world-readable for a short period.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized parties could potentially gain access to the CA key.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the system during the initial setup window could obtain the world-readable CA key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have access to the filesystem of the Puppet Enterprise server during the brief period where the CA key has world-readable permissions during initial setup.
