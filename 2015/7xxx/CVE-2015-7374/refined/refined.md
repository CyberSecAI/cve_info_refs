Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7374:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication in the Remote Agent service of InduSoft Web Studio, which listens on TCP port 1234.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing authentication: The Remote Agent service does not require any authentication to access its functionalities.
- Unprotected API calls: The lack of authentication allows attackers to execute remote API calls on the service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By making remote API calls, the attacker can execute code within the context of the current process, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Full control over the affected system: Arbitrary code execution can grant an attacker significant control over the system, allowing them to potentially steal data, install malware, or cause disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is performed remotely over the network by sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable service running on TCP port 1234.
- No user interaction required: The exploitation does not require any user interaction on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the target system's port 1234.
- No special privileges are required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the service prior to exploiting the vulnerability.
