- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SSL keys used by the Westermo industrial switches to provide secure communications are hard-coded. This means the same keys are used across all devices, and cannot be changed by the user.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded cryptographic keys lead to a vulnerability where the encryption keys used by the device can be compromised. This is due to the use of a single, unchanging key across all instances of the affected devices. The specific weakness is categorized as CWE-255: Credentials Management.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation enables a malicious party to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. This allows them to decrypt, read, and modify network traffic from the affected device. Furthermore, attackers can obtain credentials entered by the end-user, gaining authenticated access to the device.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a man-in-the-middle attack staged on the network. This allows an attacker to intercept communications between the device and other systems. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned to carry out a man-in-the-middle attack. While no high level of skill is required to exploit the vulnerability, the initial man-in-the-middle attack needs to be successful.
