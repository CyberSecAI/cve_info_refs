{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's securelevel functionality was not properly handled after performing a kexec operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system would disable securelevel after a kexec operation, even with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. This left the system vulnerable to attacks as the security mechanism of the securelevel/secureboot combination was bypassed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could bypass the securelevel/secureboot mechanism and load an unsigned kernel via kexec.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required. An attacker would need to perform a kexec operation to load a new kernel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to execute kexec."
