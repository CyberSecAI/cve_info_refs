# CVE-2015-7596 through CVE-2015-7598 & CVE-2015-7961 through CVE-2015-7967: SafeNet Authentication Service Agent vulnerabilities

Kyriakos Economou

Senior R&D team member at Nettitude

31 Mar 2016

Several SafeNet Authentication Service Agents could allow a local attacker to obtain privilege escalation due to weak ACLs assigned to subdirectories and executable modules of those products. A user with low privileges could modify and/or substitute executable modules which a high privileged user could later execute in their own security context.

## Further detail

A PDF containing further detail [has been released by the vendor](https://labs.nettitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/160125-1-Gemalto-IDSS-Security-Bulletin-SAS-Agents-Privilege-Escalation.pdf).
Their own advisory can be found here: <https://safenet.gemalto.com/technical-support/security-updates/>.

[CVE-2015-7964]

[CVE-2015-7965]

[CVE-2015-7966]

[CVE-2015-7967]

This vulnerability allows any authenticated user from any user-group (guests included), to
have full control over  the contents of the Agent’s file structure. As a result, a user from a
limited  account  can  substitute  or  modify  some  of  the  executable  modules.  As  such,  an
executable module which requires Administrator privileges could be modified and executed
by an Administrator, giving an attacker or imposter full access to the compromised host.
