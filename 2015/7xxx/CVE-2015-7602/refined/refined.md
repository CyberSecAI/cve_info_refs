{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BisonFTP server does not properly validate user input when handling file retrieval requests, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted RETR command with directory traversal characters (../), an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the FTP server and the ability to send FTP commands."
