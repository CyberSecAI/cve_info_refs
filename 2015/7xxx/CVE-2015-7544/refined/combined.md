| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c0)  Jiri Belka    2014-12-11 12:08:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967206](attachment.cgi?id=967206 "log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967206&action=edit "log") log  Description of problem: i tried to "get" support while using Power8 host in my RHEVM setup. In new case it displays:  Successfully created case number 01314536  Failed to upload attachment RHEV Manager SOS Report to case 01314536 : Internal server error  Successfully uploaded attachment RHEV Manager Database Dump to case 01314536  Failed to upload attachment Host SOS Report/ibm-p8-rhevm-hv-01.klab.eng.bos.redhat.com to case 01314536  The in-progress wheel is running, seems to be stucked...  ...but, I tried to search for my case and it displays:  Attachments  Filename	Description	Size	Attached	Attached By	Delete sos_pgdump.tar	RHEV Manager Database Dump	2.6 MB	Dec 11, 2014 12:43:44 PM	Jiri Belka	Delete ClockSkew-ibm-p8-rhevm-hv-01.klab.eng.bos.redhat.com4482032414311223972.txt	Clock Skew file for ibm-p8-rhevm-hv-01.klab.eng.bos.redhat.com	308.0 bytes	Dec 11, 2014 12:46:22 PM	Jiri Belka	Delete sosreport-ibm-p8-rhevm-hv-01.klab.eng.bos.redhat.com-20141211114337.tar.xz	Host SOS Report/ibm-p8-rhevm-hv-01.klab.eng.bos.redhat.com	51.9 MB	Dec 11, 2014 12:46:13 PM	Jiri Belka	Delete  So some sos report was uploaded for power8 server.  FYI I don't see any ERROR in redhat-support-plugin-rhev.log file.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): redhat-support-plugin-rhev-3.4.0-4.el6ev.noarch sos-2.2-68.el6.noarch sos-3.1-1.1.pkvm2_1_1.6.noarch  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. hosts -> power8 host -> right-click for Support 2. fill title and description 3. select manager sos and host sos for upload  Actual results: failure and dialog is stucked  Expected results: should work or at least dialog should not show in-progress wheel anymore  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c1)  Jiri Belka    2014-12-11 12:08:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967207](attachment.cgi?id=967207 "screenshot 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967207&action=edit "screenshot 1") screenshot 1   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c2)  Jiri Belka    2014-12-11 12:09:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967208](attachment.cgi?id=967208 "screenshot 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967208&action=edit "screenshot 2") screenshot 2   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c3)  Yaniv Lavi    2015-08-25 13:45:29 UTC  ``` Can you please ack this?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c4)  Yaniv Lavi    2015-08-25 13:46:31 UTC  ``` Can you please provide the patches that resolve this issue?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c5)  Yaniv Lavi    2015-09-08 14:13:44 UTC  ``` Do you know is this was included in the latest build to QE?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c6)  Josh Kinlaw    2015-09-08 18:45:37 UTC  ``` This is a result of the client's request timing out before the file upload is complete. This will only occur on slower setups. The attachment is actually uploaded but the user receives an error because the 1 minute timeout is reached before the file finishes. I have tried to extend the session-timeout value in web.xml but it appears that JBoss is ignoring this setting. I removed some of the less important things that the SOS report was sending in an attempt to speed up the request. Hopefully this will resolve the issue. Other than that, the best we can do is wait for the next upgrade of JBoss and see if that setting is being accepted.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1173074#c7)  Yaniv Lavi    2015-10-06 14:33:28 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 1201940](show_bug.cgi?id=1201940) ***   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: redhat-support-plugin-rhev security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0426)

## Topic

Updated redhat-support-plugin-rhev packages that fix a security flaw
and a bug are now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Red Hat Support plug-in for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
offers seamless integrated access to Red Hat subscription services
from the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization administration portal. The
plug-in provides automated functionality that enables quicker help,
answers, and proactive services. It offers easy and instant access to
Red Hat exclusive knowledge, resources, engagement, and diagnostic
features.

It was found that redhat-support-plugin-rhev passed a user-specified
path and file name directly to the command line in the log viewer
component. This could allow users with the SuperUser role on any
Entity to execute arbitrary commands on any host in the RHEV
environment. (CVE-2015-7544)

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1269588#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-10-07 15:59:03 UTC  ``` Alexander Wels of Red Hat reported vulnerability allowing anybody possessing SuperUser role on any Entity to remotely execute arbitrary code as root on any host in RHEV environment. The vulnerability is in the feature that allows to view logs that reside on the hosts from inside the UI by selecting the log from the UI. It happens as following:  /* http request to /redhat-support-plugin- rhev/logs?path=<path+filename>&machine=<name of machine selected>/ /* servlet handles the request, and passes the <path+filename> to an ssh client class./ /* The ssh client connects to the selected machine and executes as root/ / 'stat - c %s ' + <path+filename>/  Nowhere in this sequence is the <path+filename> checked or validated. The only validation that happens is that the session associated with the request has the 'SuperUser' role. It doesn't matter what entity the role is on, it just has to have that role on any entity in the RHEV system. With fairly simple url parameter manipulation, an arbitrary code can be executed as root on any host in the RHEV system. Note that SuperUser on an Entity != ROOT on the hosts.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1269588#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-12-07 18:27:34 UTC  ``` Workaround:  Removing the log viewer plugin will prevent exploitation of this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1269588#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-03-09 20:23:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.6  Via RHSA-2016:0426 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0426.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1269588#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2016-03-21 15:05:17 UTC  ``` This functionality was added in  commit b1db7cc89ac3da23c72dc97844f8be26f54973d2 on Fri Apr 18 09:32:12 2014 which was introduced in RHEV 3.4, and then removed in RHEV 3.6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1269588#c7)  Adam Mariš    2016-03-21 15:34:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Alexander Wels (Red Hat)   ``` |  |
