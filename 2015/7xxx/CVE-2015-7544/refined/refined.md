Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2015-7544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `redhat-support-plugin-rhev` passed a user-specified path and file name directly to the command line in the log viewer component. Specifically, when viewing logs, the plugin constructs an ssh command which includes a path and filename provided through a user-controlled `path` parameter in the HTTP request, this path is not sanitized or validated before being passed to the ssh command on the target host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By manipulating the `path` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the target host.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided path and filename before using it in a system command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on any host within the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) environment.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This code execution could lead to complete control of the affected hosts, potentially including data exfiltration, system disruption, or further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `/redhat-support-plugin-rhev/logs` endpoint, providing a crafted `path` parameter.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the RHEV management system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SuperUser Role:** The attacker must possess the 'SuperUser' role on any entity within the RHEV system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the RHEV management server.
*   **Knowledge of the API Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerable endpoint (`/redhat-support-plugin-rhev/logs`) and how to manipulate its parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in RHEV 3.4 and was removed in RHEV 3.6
*   The provided fix was to remove the log viewer plugin or to update to the fixed package version.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Alexander Wels of Red Hat.
*   The fix was included in the `redhat-support-plugin-rhev-3.6.0-12.el6` package.
