Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-7191:

**CVE-2015-7191**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla Firefox on Android handles URL strings received via intents, specifically the `browser_fallback_url` extra. Firefox doesn't properly sanitize these URLs, leading to a bypass of security restrictions
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insufficient input sanitization
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a website visited via intent on Firefox for Android. This could lead to various impacts such as unauthorized data access, session hijacking, or defacement.
*   **Attack vectors:** A crafted Android application can send a malicious intent to Firefox, with a crafted URL in the `browser_fallback_url` extra, triggering the vulnerability upon fallback navigation.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create and install a malicious Android application on a device, and for the victim to interact with this malicious app in a way that triggers the sending of the intent.

**Summary of vulnerability:** The core problem is the improper handling of URLs provided in Android intents, which leads to XSS when a fallback URL is used. The lack of input validation allows arbitrary javascript to be executed.
