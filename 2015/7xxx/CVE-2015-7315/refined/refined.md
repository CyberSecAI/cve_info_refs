Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `addMember` method in Plone's `RegistrationTool` being unintentionally exposed as a "publishable object". In Zope, objects with docstrings and names not starting with an underscore are considered publishable. This means the `addMember` method could be accessed directly via a URL, bypassing intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Exposure of Internal Method:** The `addMember` method, meant for internal use and administrative actions, was exposed as a public endpoint due to Zope's publishable object rules.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability allowed unauthenticated users to call the `addMember` method directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized User Creation:** Attackers could create new user accounts on the Plone site without requiring administrator approval or needing valid credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Abuse:** The creation of unauthorized accounts could be used for further malicious activities, such as content manipulation, spamming, or more severe attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers could craft a direct HTTP request to the exposed `addMember` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Plone site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability since it bypasses access controls.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix was to ensure the `addMember` method was not publishable by commenting out the method description which prevented Zope from exposing it.
*   The vulnerability affected Plone versions 3.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x, <4.3.7 and <5.0rc1.
