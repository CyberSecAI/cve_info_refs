> Do not make this a normal method comment. Doing so makes
> this method publishable

Use CVE-2015-7315.

We think this might be a somewhat unusual vulnerability cause. See
"Zope has few restrictions on publishable objects. The basic rule is
that the object must have a doc string. This requirement goes for
method objects too. Another requirement is that a publishable object
must not have a name that begin with an underscore. These two
restrictions are designed to keep private objects from being
published." on the
<http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zdgbook/ObjectPublishing.html> page.
