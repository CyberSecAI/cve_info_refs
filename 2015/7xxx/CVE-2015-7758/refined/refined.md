Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The LaTeX editor "gummi" creates temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable filenames based on the basename of the file being edited, along with specific extensions such as `.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, `.pdf`, or `.toc`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Predictable Filenames:** The program uses predictable filenames in `/tmp`, which are based on the name of the file being edited which leads to a race condition.
- **Symlink Attack:** A local attacker can exploit this predictable naming scheme by creating symbolic links with the same predictable names, pointing to locations of their choice.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **File Overwriting:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
- **Privilege Escalation (potential):** While not explicitly stated, overwriting certain files could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
- **Denial of Service:** Overwriting crucial configuration files could cause a denial-of-service condition for affected users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates symbolic links in `/tmp` before gummi creates its temporary files.
- **Race Condition:** The attack relies on a race condition between the attacker creating the symlink and gummi creating the temporary file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to perform the attack.
-  The attacker must be able to predict the filename that `gummi` will create in `/tmp`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multi-user systems more severely since multiple users could potentially be writing to the same files in /tmp if they are editing files with the same name.
- The exploitability of this issue depends on the `/proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks` setting on Linux.
- The issue was fixed by changing how temporary files are named to be less predictable.
- Debian decided not to issue a DSA (Debian Security Advisory) for this issue, because symlink protection is enabled by default on their systems. However, they did fix it via proposed updates.
- Several distributions and versions were affected, including openSUSE 13.1, 13.2, Leap, Tumbleweed, and Debian.
