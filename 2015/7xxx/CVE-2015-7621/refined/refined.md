- Use-after-free vulnerability: This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Adobe Reader DC. This can allow the attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: The attacker can embed the specially crafted U3D object in a malicious PDF file.
- Malicious web page: The attacker can host the malicious U3D object on a webpage which, when visited, triggers the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required: The user must either open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage containing the exploit in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted U3D object that can trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to deliver the crafted U3D object to the victim, either through a malicious PDF or a malicious webpage.
- The attacker must induce the victim to open the malicious file or visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader on Windows and Macintosh platforms.
- Adobe has released security updates to address the vulnerability.
