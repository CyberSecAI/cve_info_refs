Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7632:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow exists within the `Loader` object in Adobe Flash Player. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when manipulating the `loaderBytes` property of a `Loader` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, meaning that by providing more data than the buffer is designed to hold, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system within the context of the Flash Player process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, meaning they do not need direct access to the victim's machine.
*  **User interaction required:** The user must either visit a malicious web page containing a crafted SWF file, or open a malicious Flash file directly in order to trigger the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute a malicious SWF file, which can be done through a website, email attachment or other delivery method.
*   They need to manipulate the `loaderBytes` property of a `Loader` object in the SWF file in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
