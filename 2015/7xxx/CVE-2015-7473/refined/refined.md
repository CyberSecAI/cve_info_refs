- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `runmqsc` utility allows users with `+connect` and `+dsp` authority to execute certain MQSC commands that should normally require higher privileges. This is a privilege escalation issue where a user gains access to commands they should not have.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control in the `runmqsc` utility.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker with `+connect` and `+dsp` permissions can execute commands against the local queue manager that they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine where WebSphere MQ is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have `+connect` and `+dsp` authority to the queue manager.
