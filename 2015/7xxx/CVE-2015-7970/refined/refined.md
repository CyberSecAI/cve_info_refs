{
  "CVE-2015-7970": {
    "Description": "The p2m_pod_emergency_sweep function in arch/x86/mm/p2m-pod.c in Xen 3.4.x, 3.5.x, and 3.6.x is not preemptible, which allows local x86 HVM guest administrators to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly reboot) via crafted memory contents that triggers a 'time-consuming linear scan,' related to Populate-on-Demand.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `p2m_pod_emergency_sweep` function, which scans memory for reclamation, is non-preemptible, leading to long CPU usage.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Non-preemptible function during memory reclamation in Xen."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause a denial of service. Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. If a host watchdog is in use, this can lead to a watchdog timeout and a reboot of the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious HVM guest administrator can trigger the vulnerable code by creating specific memory contents that lead to the time consuming linear memory scan.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local x86 HVM guest administrator is required."

   "CVE-2015-8104":{
        "Description": "The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.2.6, and Xen 4.3.x through 4.6.x, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS panic or hang) by triggering many #DB (aka Debug) exceptions, related to svm.c.",
         "Root cause of vulnerability":"A guest OS can cause a denial of service on the host by triggering an infinite stream of debug exceptions via #DB. The microcode enters an infinite loop, preventing the core from receiving other interrupts.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "Infinite loop in microcode due to recursive #DB exception handling."
         ],
        "Impact of exploitation":"Malicious HVM guest administrator can cause a denial of service, preventing use of a physical CPU for a significant period. Can also lead to a host reboot due to a watchdog timeout.",
       "Attack vectors":"A malicious HVM guest can trigger the vulnerability by setting up a hardware breakpoint covering a data structure involved in delivering #DB, which leads to an infinite loop.",

  "CVE-2015-7311": {
    "Description": "libxl in Xen 4.1.x through 4.6.x does not properly handle the readonly flag on disks when using the qemu-xen device model, which allows local guest users to write to a read-only disk image.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "libxl does not pass the read-only flag to qemu-xen, and qemu itself doesn't have a way to enforce read-only on disks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "libxl fails to enforce the readonly flag on disks with qemu-xen.",
       "qemu doesn't support read-only disks."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Malicious guest administrators or users may be able to write to supposedly read-only disk images.",
    "Attack vectors": "A guest administrator can write to a read-only disk image by exploiting the lack of enforcement in libxl and qemu.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local guest user."

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "A benign exception (#AC) occurs while another exception is being delivered, causing an infinite loop in the CPU when the IDT entry for #AC points to a ring-3 handler and the stack is unaligned.",
