Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ReadyNet WRT300N-DD Wireless Router uses non-random default credentials of `admin:admin` for its web administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-255: Credentials Management:** The use of default, easily guessable credentials is a major security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** A local area network (LAN) attacker can gain complete control of the device by logging in using the default credentials.
- **Remote Attacks:** The default credentials can be leveraged in remote attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). While CSRF is described under CVE-2015-7281, the document clarifies that the default credentials can be used to establish an active session as part of an attack, making it easier to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Area Network:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable device can directly access the web management interface using the default credentials.
- **Remote Attacks via CSRF:** While the primary attack vector for CSRF vulnerability is a user with an active session, default credentials allow an attacker to establish such session, facilitating a CSRF attack, allowing an attacker to perform actions with the same permissions as an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Network Access:** An attacker must be on the same LAN as the vulnerable router to directly access its web interface.
- **Ability to make requests:**  For remote CSRF attacks the attacker needs to be able to induce a user into triggering a malicious request. However, the ability to log in with the default credentials circumvents the need for an active user session.

**Additional Notes:**
The document also mentions two other vulnerabilities in the same device:
- CVE-2015-7281: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- CVE-2015-7282: Use of Insufficiently Random Values for DNS queries
These are described alongside CVE-2015-7280 in the same document.
