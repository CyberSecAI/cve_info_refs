Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7966

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to subdirectories and executable modules of SafeNet Authentication Service Agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file permissions: Authenticated users, including guests, have full control over the agent's file structure. This allows any user to modify or substitute executable modules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: A low-privilege user can modify an executable module and wait for an administrator to execute the altered module. Upon execution, the attacker gains the privileges of the administrator, leading to full access to the compromised host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system where the SafeNet Authentication Service Agent is installed.
- File Modification/Substitution:  The attacker needs to modify or replace vulnerable executables within the application's installation directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid user account with local access to the machine running the affected SafeNet Authentication Service Agent.
-  No elevated privileges are initially required but the ability to write or modify files in the agent's installation directory.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability impacts multiple SafeNet Authentication Service Agents (see list in the provided content).
- Mitigation includes applying maintenance releases provided by the vendor or manually adjusting file permissions for affected installations.
- The provided content includes a link to the vendor's security bulletin which provides more details on the vulnerability and mitigation steps.
-The content also includes a manual mitigation process for those products that don't have a release scheduled.
