- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Jazz Foundation uses weaker than expected encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weak encryption algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user could potentially obtain sensitive information due to the weak encryption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
