Customers are advised that the webserver is disabled by default.  Because web services are
only necessary for specific maintenance, configuration, or monitoring activities, it is advised to
disable web services all together during times when the services are not needed. Customers
are also advised to:

•  Configure access control lists to restrict web server access to authorized IP addresses.

•  Protect access to Modicon products with network, industrial, and application firewalls.

 Product Information

GoAhead Web Server is the webserver component used on Schneider Electric Modicon M340
PLC BMXNOx and BMXPx devices.

How to determine if you are affected

Products affected are listed in “Affected products” above with webserver service activated.

 General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended.

10-Dec-15 (9-Jun-20) Document Reference Number – SEVD-2015-344-01 (V2.0)  Page 3 of 5

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB
drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended
network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems, and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2015-344-01>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
