processing, and application platform
capabilities in-memory. The platform provides libraries for predictive,
planning, text processing, spatial
and business analytics.

========================

Using the multiple methods available in the TrexNet protocol, a remote
unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary operating system commands,
python modules, read, write and delete files and directories, read
environment information and also completely shut down the SAP HANA
instance. The attacker could also send TMS queries to the NameSever
component,  which could allow him to retrieve technical information of the
remote system such as configuration files. All methods are executed with
the <sid>adm user. To perform these actions, the attacker only needs to be
able to send a crafted packet to any of the following ports (Being NN the
instance number of the SAP HANA Application Server):

NameServer: 3NN01
Preprocessor: 3NN02
IndexServer: 3NN03
StatisticsServer: 3NN05
WebDispatcher: 3NN06
XSEngine: 3NN07
CompileServer: 3NN10

The methods available are: fcopydir, fmkdir, frmdir, getenv, dumpenv,
fcopy, fput, fdel, fmove, fget, fappend, fdir, getTraces, kill, pexec,
