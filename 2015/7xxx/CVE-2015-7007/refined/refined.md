Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7007:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way macOS versions prior to 10.11.1 handled the `applescript://` URL scheme. This scheme opens the provided script directly in the AppleScript Editor. The editor would then execute the script when the user presses `cmd-R` without any further confirmation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of user confirmation:** The AppleScript Editor did not prompt for explicit user confirmation before executing scripts when `cmd-R` was pressed.
*   **`applescript://` URL Scheme handling:** The operating system did not properly sanitize or restrict the use of the `applescript://` URL scheme when opened via a web browser.
*   **Key press event hooking:** The browser's javascript can hook the command key press event and redirect to the malicious url.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary AppleScript code on the victim's machine. This can lead to various outcomes, including:

*   Arbitrary code execution
*   System compromise
*   Data exfiltration
*   Installation of malware

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web browser:** An attacker can embed a malicious link with the `applescript://` URL scheme on a webpage.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to trick the user to visit the malicious webpage and press `cmd-R`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or find a way to insert the malicious `applescript://` link into a page visited by the target user.
*   The attacker must also convince the user to press `cmd-R` while on the malicious page in Safari, which can be aided by showing a message such as "This page has failed to load. Press cmd-R to refresh."
*   (Optional) If Gatekeeper is enabled on the target system, the user may get an "unidentified developer prompt" and therefore the attacker may need to trick the user into disabling gatekeeper or target environments where it is disabled.
