{
  "CVE-2015-7208": {
    "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 stores cookies containing vertical tab characters, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading HTTP Cookie headers.",
    "Root cause": "Firefox allows storing vertical tabs (ASCII 11) in cookies. When later replayed by the browser, they can be interpreted by the parser as a new line, leading to potential cookie injection.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Mishandling of control characters"
     ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information or conduct cookie injection attacks by setting cookies containing vertical tab characters, which may be mishandled by web servers during parsing.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious user sends a crafted link or injects a value through a URL parameter that includes a vertical tab character within a cookie value, which the web server might then mishandle when parsing the cookie.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted website or have some way of setting a cookie via the user's browser that contains a vertical tab. The target site must parse the cookie using a vulnerable web server or library. This is a client-side vulnerability that needs a server-side vulnerability to be fully exploited."
