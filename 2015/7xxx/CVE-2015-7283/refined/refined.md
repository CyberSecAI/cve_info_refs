      "CWE-255: Credentials Management - The device uses default credentials of admin:1234.",
      "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - The device is vulnerable to CSRF attacks."
    ],
    "impact": "A local area network attacker can gain privileged access to the device's web management interface using the default credentials, potentially taking complete control. An attacker can also perform actions as an authenticated user if they can induce the user to trigger a malicious request. When combined with default credentials, an attacker can establish a session as part of the attack without needing a logged-in victim.",

        "Local area network access to the web management interface.",

    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "For direct access, the attacker must be on the same local area network.",
      "For CSRF, an attacker needs to trick a user with an active session to trigger a malicious request. However, default credentials allow attackers to establish a session themselves."
