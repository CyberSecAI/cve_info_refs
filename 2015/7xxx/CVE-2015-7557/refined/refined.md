Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-7557:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds heap read was found in librsvg2 while parsing SVG files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds heap read. This means the software is attempting to read data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer, potentially leaking sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure due to the out-of-bounds read. The provided text doesn't elaborate further than "out-of-bounds heap read", but this could potentially leak sensitive data such as memory contents of the process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted SVG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable software with a malicious SVG file. This could potentially happen through a web browser that renders SVG files, a file upload, or other similar scenarios where the user/application processes a SVG file from a malicious source.
