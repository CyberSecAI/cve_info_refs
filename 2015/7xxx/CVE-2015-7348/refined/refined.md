### CVE-2015-7348

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the zTree v3 component, specifically in the `id` parameter of the `getNodesForBigData.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker can hijack a logged-in user's session, potentially gaining control over their account.
- Privilege escalation: If an administrator's session is hijacked, the attacker gains full admin privileges on the web application.
- Arbitrary code execution: The attacker could inject malicious JavaScript to perform actions on behalf of the victim, including changing the password.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the payload in the `id` parameter of  `/zTree_v3-master/demo/en/asyncData/getNodesForBigData.php`. 
- Additionally, the `id` parameter of the `/zTree_v3-master/demo/en/asyncData/getNodes.php` is vulnerable when submitted through POST.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote and does not need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to craft the malicious URL or POST data and trick a victim into accessing it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects zTree versions 3.5.19.1 and possibly below.
- The fix involves applying HTML escaping using `htmlspecialchars()` to user-controlled parameters.
- The provided exploit samples show the injection of Javascript code.
