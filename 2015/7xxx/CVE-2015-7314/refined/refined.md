Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the `tempfile` object within the gollum application's file upload functionality. Specifically, the application didn't verify if the uploaded file was indeed a `Tempfile` object before processing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the missing check on the type of the `tempfile` object before processing it, which leads to arbitrary file access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Due to the lack of validation, an attacker could manipulate the upload process to gain read access to arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read any file accessible to the gollum application on the server. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential information.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger it over the network without needing local access to the server.
*   **File Upload Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the file upload process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the gollum server.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a file upload to the gollum application.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The JVN analysis indicates that authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to ensure that the `tempfile` object is indeed a `Tempfile` object: `halt 500 unless tempfile.is_a? Tempfile`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Shoji Baba to IPA and coordinated with the developer by JPCERT/CC.
* The JVN analysis provides a CVSS base score of 4.3, with a network attack vector, medium complexity, no authentication, and a partial confidentiality impact.
