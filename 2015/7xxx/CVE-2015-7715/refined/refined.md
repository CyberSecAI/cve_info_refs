CVE-2015-7715:
    Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. Input passed via multiple parameters is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
    Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    Impact of exploitation:
        - CSRF: An attacker can perform actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious website.
        - XSS: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.
    Attack vectors:
        - CSRF: Malicious website containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application.
        - XSS: Malicious input injected via HTTP POST parameters.
    Required attacker capabilities/position:
        - CSRF: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website.
        - XSS: The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input to the vulnerable parameters.
