Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7765:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the presence of a default, hidden account (`IntegrationUser`) with administrative privileges and a hardcoded password ("plugin") within ManageEngine OpManager. This account is not visible through the user interface and its password cannot be reset using standard means.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The most significant weakness is the use of a default, hardcoded password for the `IntegrationUser` account. This makes it easy for attackers to gain initial access.
*   **Hidden Account:** The `IntegrationUser` account is not visible in the user management interface, making it difficult for administrators to discover and manage the account.
*   **SQL Query Protection Bypass:**  The application attempts to prevent direct SQL injection by blocking INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries, but this protection can easily be bypassed by inserting a comment `/**/` within the query (e.g., `INSERT/**/INTO ...`).
*   **Unrestricted SQL Query Execution:** The application allows any authenticated administrator to execute arbitrary SQL queries through a web form, creating a significant security risk.
*   **PostgreSQL running as SYSTEM:** The PostgreSQL database backend runs with SYSTEM privileges in Windows environments, escalating the impact of any successful exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

*   **Gain System Level Access:** By writing a malicious WAR file to the "tomcat/webroot" directory via a crafted SQL query, the attacker can automatically deploy the payload which will be executed with SYSTEM level privileges, thus achieving complete compromise of the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to deploy a WAR archive on the server allows for arbitrary code execution on the underlying operating system.
*   **Full Control of the System:**  With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can perform a wide range of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, system manipulation, and establishing persistence.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the web interface of ManageEngine OpManager.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers exploit the lack of proper SQL query sanitization via the `/api/json/admin/SubmitQuery` endpoint to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Default Credentials:** Attackers utilize the default username/password of the hidden `IntegrationUser` account to authenticate to the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable ManageEngine OpManager server.
*   **Authentication to Web Interface:** The attacker needs to either know the default `IntegrationUser` credentials or have other administrative credentials.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit is confirmed to work on ManageEngine OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.
*   A Metasploit module has been developed to automate this attack.
*   ManageEngine released a patch to address these vulnerabilities.
