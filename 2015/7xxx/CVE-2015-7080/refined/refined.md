- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Client-side restrictions were not being checked by the server when a request was made to Siri.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient server-side validation of client-side restrictions for Siri requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A person with physical access to an iOS device could use Siri to read notifications of content that is set not to be displayed at the lock screen.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required. The attacker must use Siri to request access to notifications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to an unlocked iOS device.
