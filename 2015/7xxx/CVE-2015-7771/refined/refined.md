Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper processing of the SSID (Service Set Identifier) by the applican platform when building hybrid applications for Android and iOS. Specifically, a lack of proper input validation allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Script Injection: The applican platform fails to sanitize or validate the SSID input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): This is the primary weakness, as the software does not adequately check and filter the SSID input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: A successful attack can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected application.
- Unsanctioned API Calls: Attackers can leverage the injected script to call arbitrary APIs exposed by the applican platform.
- Potential for various malicious actions: This can range from data theft to unauthorized modifications within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Wi-Fi Spot: An attacker needs to set up a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot that broadcasts a specially crafted SSID.
- Adjacent Network Access: The attacker must be within the range of the Wi-Fi network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must be within range of a vulnerable device that is connected to the malicious Wi-Fi network.
- Must have the ability to create a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot and broadcast a crafted SSID.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Applications built using applican for Android versions 1.12.6 and earlier.
- Applications built using applican for iOS versions 1.12.3 and earlier.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is categorized with a CVSS v2 base score of 5.4, indicating a medium severity.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended solution is to update the applican runtime engine to version 1.13.0 or later and rebuild the affected applications.
