Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-7570:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the "dbhost" parameter used in the `test_adodb_lite.php`, `test_datadictionary.php`, and `test_adodb_lite_sessions.php` files within the Yeager CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform internal port scanning by manipulating the "dbhost" parameter.
- This allows the attacker to probe internal network resources which are not accessible from the outside internet.
- They can determine the availability of specific hosts and ports by measuring time delays of responses.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed by sending a request to the following URLs:
  - `http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite.php`
  - `http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_datadictionary.php`
  - `http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite_sessions.php`
- The attacker uses the "dbhost" parameter to specify an internal IP address and port number to scan.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Yeager CMS instance.
- Basic knowledge of time-based analysis is required for port scanning.
