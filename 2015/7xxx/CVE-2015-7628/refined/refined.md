Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a flaw in Adobe Flash Player that allows a bypass of the same-origin policy due to an unspecified vector, which would lead to information disclosure. Specifically, this vulnerability could be exploited to overwrite the content of an iframe.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the same-origin policy, which is a crucial security mechanism that prevents scripts from accessing resources from a different origin.
*   **Information Disclosure**: This is a consequence of bypassing the same-origin policy which allows the attacker to potentially read contents that are not intended to be seen from different domains.
*   **Memory Corruption:** While the CVE description does not explicitly mention memory corruption as the root cause for this CVE, some of the provided sources (SUSE and OpenSUSE) mention that multiple CVEs fixed in the same update as this one are related to memory corruption vulnerabilities, including some that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By bypassing the same-origin policy, attackers can potentially access sensitive information from other domains. This can be done by overwriting the iframe content with a malicious one that collects/steals information from the victim.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the main vector in this CVE is not specifically related to arbitrary code execution, it is possible this could happen depending on how the information disclosure is used in further attacks. Other CVEs fixed in the same security update are specifically related to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not specified in the description of CVE-2015-7628, other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update include ones which result in a denial of service when triggered.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network. An attacker needs to make a user process specially crafted Flash content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any specific credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User interaction required:** The victim needs to load a web page with malicious flash content, either by directly visiting a malicious website or by opening a malicious ad in a different trusted web site.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   The provided sources show that this vulnerability was resolved as part of a larger update that fixed multiple security issues in Adobe Flash Player.
*   The vulnerability was rated as having "critical" severity by SUSE and Red Hat while MITRE and JVN rate it as "Medium".
*   CVSS v2 scores for this vulnerability range from 5 to 10.
*   Red Hat and SUSE also mention the possibility of remote code execution as a side effect of the vulnerabilities fixed by this patch, even though the CVE description only talks about information disclosure.
