A local attacker, with write privilege (in)to a directory, where MountManager class performed JAR files expansion, could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to their ability to [recursively] delete or overwrite arbitrary directory, accessible with the privileges of the user running the application utilizing the libbluray library).  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-03 13:17:10 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the libbluray package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-02-23 02:32:42 UTC  ``` From the original report by Florian Weimer:  Creating a temporary file, deleting it, and re-creating it as a directory is racy:          File tmpDir = null;         try {             jar = new JarFile(path);             tmpDir = File.createTempFile(\"bdj-\", \"\");         } catch (IOException e) {             e.printStackTrace();             throw new MountException();         }                  // create temporary directory         tmpDir.delete();         tmpDir.mkdir();  Another user might create a directory with wide permissions and do nasty stuff in there.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c3)  Adam Mariš    2015-11-03 12:49:30 UTC  ``` CVE was assigned:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/70>   ``` |\n| --- | --- |\n\n---\n\n| Note You need to [log in](show_bug.cgi?id=959433&GoAheadAndLogIn=1) before you can comment on or make changes to this bug. |\n| --- |\n\n---\n\n[Privacy](page.cgi?id=redhat/privacy.html)\n[Contact](page.cgi?id=redhat/contact.html)\n[FAQ](page.cgi?id=faq.html)\n[Legal](page.cgi?id=terms-conditions.html)\n",
