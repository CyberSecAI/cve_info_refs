| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-03 13:14:56 UTC  ``` A time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition flaw was found in the way the MountManager class implementation of libbluray, a library to access Blu-Ray disks for video playback, performed expansion of JAR archives / files. A local attacker, with write privilege (in)to a directory, where MountManager class performed JAR files expansion, could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to their ability to [recursively] delete or overwrite arbitrary directory, accessible with the privileges of the user running the application utilizing the libbluray library).  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-03 13:17:10 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the libbluray package, as shipped with Fedora release of 17, 18, and Fedora EPEL-6.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-02-23 02:32:42 UTC  ``` From the original report by Florian Weimer:  Creating a temporary file, deleting it, and re-creating it as a directory is racy:          File tmpDir = null;         try {             jar = new JarFile(path);             tmpDir = File.createTempFile("bdj-", "");         } catch (IOException e) {             e.printStackTrace();             throw new MountException();         }                  // create temporary directory         tmpDir.delete();         tmpDir.mkdir();  Another user might create a directory with wide permissions and do nasty stuff in there.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=959433#c3)  Adam Mariš    2015-11-03 12:49:30 UTC  ``` CVE was assigned:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/70>   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1160757#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-01-13 09:50:45 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-7810  A time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition flaw was found in the way the MountManager class implementation of libbluray, a library to access Blu-Ray disks for video playback, performed expansion of JAR archives / files. A local attacker, with write privilege (in)to a directory, where MountManager class performed JAR files expansion, could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to their ability to [recursively] delete or overwrite arbitrary directory, accessible with the privileges of the user running the application utilizing the libbluray library).  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security Team.

This is a situation in which there may be multiple valid perspectives.
What we're going to do is assign a CVE ID to the Fedora package for
the use of --enable-bdjava at a time when there had not been an
upstream release with default support for BD-J. Use CVE-2015-7810.

The upstream default was changed here:

  <http://git.videolan.org/?p=libbluray.git;a=commit;h=a83104c1c31301c4b2eb593b21e7b43f5480bd64>

on 2015-02-03. Default support for BD-J was present in 0.8.0 (released
2015-04-29) but not in 0.7.0 (released 2015-01-27).
<https://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libbluray/> doesn't list any
releases between these.

In 0.7.0, the configure script has:

  --enable-bdjava         enable BD-Java support (default is no)

under "Optional Features" but we didn't find any documentation or
comments suggesting that --enable-bdjava was recommended for general
use cases at that time. Apparently, BDJSecurityManager development
came after 0.7.0.

In other words, our perspective is that the primary known mistake is
that the Fedora packaging process chose a non-standard default
behavior, and either didn't investigate or didn't document the risks.
If anyone else independently chose --enable-bdjava for their package
based on 0.7.0 or earlier, then they can have their own CVE ID.

On the question of whether CVE IDs can be assigned for an upstream
BDJSecurityManager error (or omission), we don't currently know.
Certainly if the upstream documentation announced that the product was
intended for arbitrary untrusted Blu-ray content, then any
security-relevant behavior would be a vulnerability. Blu-ray content
is designed to be (in some senses, but maybe not all arbitrary senses)
executable content.
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/23/12> suggests an
original upstream goal of handling trusted content in which the Java
code is trusted Java code. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to
interpret BDJSecurityManager as a work in progress. The existence of
later releases doesn't mean they have announced that they are
finished. For the general case of attacks that use media content, the
CVE assignment process has an expectation that untrusted content may
occur; however, any known upstream goal is always considered (also,
the situation details are unusual here because the attack relies on
Java, not memory safety in handling audio/video data).

Similarly,
<https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2015/february/abusing-blu-ray-players-pt.-1-sandbox-escapes/>
mentions (among its other findings) "Many physical players have
settings to prevent discs from accessing the Internet for privacy
reasons." If a device's documentation stated that the Internet would
never be accessed, and the observed behavior were that the Internet is
accessed, then there could be a CVE.

Finally, we do realize that:

 <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/06/9>

has different reports.

| [Description](#c0)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2015-11-03 14:05:36 UTC  ``` From ${URL}: It was found that org.videolan.BDJLoader class implementation of libbluray, a library to access Blu-Ray disks for video playback, was missing Java Security Manager sandboxing.  A specially-crafted Java application, utilizing the functionality of org.videolan.BDJLoader class, could use this missing feature to perform actions as the user running the Bluray player application.  Note: libbluray upstream disables BD-J support by default, but some downstreams (like Fedora) pass --enable-bdjava at configure time, enabling it for their distribution.  From <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/10/12/7> :  This is a situation in which there may be multiple valid perspectives. What we're going to do is assign a CVE ID to the Fedora package for the use of --enable-bdjava at a time when there had not been an upstream release with default support for BD-J. Use CVE-2015-7810. ... In other words, our perspective is that the primary known mistake is that the Fedora packaging process chose a non-standard default behavior, and either didn't investigate or didn't document the risks. If anyone else independently chose --enable-bdjava for their package based on 0.7.0 or earlier, then they can have their own CVE ID.  ### At least libblueray 0.6.2 ebuild is still in tree which enable bdjava when java use flag is specified, and as such is vulnerable to this. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-02-20 04:31:21 UTC  ``` All versions in tree are vulnerable.  Please advise on how the maintainer or project would like to proceed.  This may require removing functionality from the user in a multilib environment. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-06-03 19:40:20 UTC  ``` I am tending to close this as resolved:invalid. Reasons:  1) We don't enable BD-J support per default. The user has to manually enable that feature (that's why I am downgrading from B to C).  2) Users who enabled BD-J support should have known how BD-J works (i.e. that BD-J is basically executing arbitrary JAVA files from unknown sources). There's no reason to expect the feature uses some kind of sandboxing. So having some kind of sandboxing is more like a feature request, see <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/10/12/7>  3) So for me this isn't a security bug, therefore closing as "invalid" is the only applicable status for me. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2017-09-17 15:41:58 UTC  ``` Agree with Thomas. ``` |  |
