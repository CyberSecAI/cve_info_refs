Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks within the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) portal client and server when communicating over the HTTP/HTTPS interface. An attacker can intercept and modify network packets exchanged between the client and server, manipulating user authority and permission levels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization enforcement, allowing modification of packets to elevate privileges.
- **Packet Manipulation:** The vulnerability relies on the attacker's ability to modify HTTP/HTTPS packets, indicating a lack of sufficient integrity checks on the data transmitted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user with low privileges can escalate their authority to an administrator level, enabling unauthorized access and control over the ITM environment.
- **Remote Command Execution:**  The elevated privileges can be leveraged to execute commands on the remote systems managed by IBM Tivoli Monitoring.
- **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the ITM environment is possible, potentially impacting managed systems as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned where they can intercept and manipulate the network traffic between the Tivoli Portal client and server.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** A MitM attack is a likely way to perform the packet modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the network path between the Tivoli Portal client and the server.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a user account within the ITM system.
- **Packet manipulation skills:** Ability to intercept, modify and resend HTTP/HTTPS packets.
