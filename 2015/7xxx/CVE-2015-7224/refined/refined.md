- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in username validation within the `puppetlabs-mysql` module caused database user accounts to be created without passwords under specific circumstances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `mysql_user` parameter, when including a host with a netmask, didn't properly incorporate the netmask during user creation. This led to the creation of two accounts: one without the netmask and one with the netmask but lacking a password, if a subsequent `mysql_grant` is executed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially use the password-less account with the netmask to access the database remotely without authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions on the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the `mysql_user` parameter with a host specified using a netmask and subsequent usage of `mysql_grant` on the same user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the created accounts, and have network access to the database from the specified netmask to leverage the vulnerability. They don't require any pre-existing credentials due to the missing password.
