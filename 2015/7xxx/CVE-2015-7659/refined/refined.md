    "CVE": "CVE-2015-7659",
    "CWE": "CWE-843",
    "Summary": "The vulnerability is due to a type confusion in the NetConnection object implementation within Adobe Flash Player, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Root cause": "An unspecified type confusion in the NetConnection object implementation in Adobe Flash Player.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "By leveraging an unspecified \"type confusion\" in the NetConnection object implementation within a specially crafted SWF file.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious SWF file. User interaction is required, as the user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
