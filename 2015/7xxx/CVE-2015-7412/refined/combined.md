# Security Bulletin: Padding Oracle Protection in IBM DataPower Gateways GatewayScript modules (CVE-2015-7412)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM DataPower Gateways has addressed a Padding Oracle Protection vulnerability in GatewayScript decryption.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7412](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7412) IBM DataPower Gateways GatewayScript modules may be vulnerable to Padding Oracle attacks in some scenarios, which could allow an attacker to decrypt the captured message, and other messages encrypted using the same cryptographic keys.

CVSS Base Score: 3.7

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107532> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM DataPower Gateway appliances version 7.2.0.0

## Remediation/Fixes

Fix is available in versions 7.2.0.1. Refer to [APAR IT10701](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT10701) for URLs to download the fix.

You should verify applying this fix does not cause any compatibility issues.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

This vulnerability exists only in IBM DataPower Gateways functions configured with a JWE decrypt action, or using the GatewayScript decryption API.

Requiring the ciphertext to be signed by the sender, and verifying that signature as a prerequisite to performing decryption will address the vulnerability.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  The JWE decrypt action and GatewayScript crypto and JOSE modules
  might be vulnerable to the padding oracle attack in some
  scenarios.  Any decryption operation that uses these components
  might face this security exposure.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  Sign the encrypted data, and put a verify operation before the
  decrypt operation.

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  Affects users who decrypt untrusted data using either the JWE
  decrypt action or GatewayScript programs that perform decrypt
  operations that use the crypto or JOSE modules.

  The JWE decrypt action and GatewayScript crypto and JOSE modules
   may be vulnerable to the 'padding oracle attack' in some
  scenarios.
  Any decryption operation that uses these components faces this
  security exposure.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Fix is available in 7.2.0.1
