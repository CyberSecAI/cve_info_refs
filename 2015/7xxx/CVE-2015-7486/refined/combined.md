# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities affect multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology (CVE-2015-7484, CVE-2015-7474, CVE-2015-7485, CVE-2015-7486, CVE-2016-0219)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Vulnerabilities in the IBM Jazz Foundation affects the following IBM Jazz Team Server based Applications: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7484](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7484) IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager could allow an authenticated user that has been added to lifecycle projects to obtain sensitive information by sending a specially crafted URL to the Lifecycle Query Engine.

CVSS Base Score: 3.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108619> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7474](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7474) **DESCRIPTION:** IBM Jazz Foundation and IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a field to inject malicious script into a Web page which would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the page is viewed. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

CVSS Base Score: 5.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108501> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
