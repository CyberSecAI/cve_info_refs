Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the Bolt CMS theme editor. While the CMS restricts direct uploads of PHP files, it fails to validate the file type during the renaming process. This allows an attacker to upload a file with an allowed extension (e.g., a PNG image) containing malicious PHP code, and then rename it to a PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper checks on the file type during renaming operations within the theme editor. The system relies on the extension, not the actual content, to determine file types.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Although PHP files cannot be uploaded directly, the combination of uploading files with allowed extensions and renaming them to PHP files essentially allows for arbitrary file upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By successfully renaming an uploaded file to have a PHP extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web server and the data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker interacts with the web server via HTTP requests, specifically targeting the Bolt CMS theme editor and its file renaming functionality.
- **File Upload/Rename:** The attack vector consists of uploading a file with allowed extensions containing malicious PHP code and subsequently renaming it to a PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid admin credentials to access the theme editor in the Bolt CMS.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the Bolt CMS to send HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know that the system is running Bolt CMS version 2.2.4 (or potentially a vulnerable version).

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was found in Bolt CMS version 2.2.4.
-   A fix was released in version 2.2.5.
-   The exploit was publicly disclosed on 2015-08-17.
-   A Metasploit module exists for this vulnerability.
-   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to upload a file, rename it, and then access it to achieve code execution.
