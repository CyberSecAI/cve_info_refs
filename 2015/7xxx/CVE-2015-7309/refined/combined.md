# CMS Bolt File Upload Vulnerability

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### CMS Bolt File Upload Vulnerability

Disclosed
08/17/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

Bolt CMS contains a flaw that allows an authenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This module was
tested on version 2.2.4.

#### Author(s)

* Tim Coen
* Roberto Soares Espreto <robertoespreto@gmail.com>

#### Platform

PHP

#### Architectures

php

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/bolt_file_upload.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/multi/http/bolt_file_upload.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/multi/http/bolt_file_upload
msf exploit(bolt_file_upload) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(bolt_file_upload) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(bolt_file_upload) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(bolt_file_upload) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

# Bolt 2.2.4 - Code Execution

*From*: "Curesec Research Team (CRT)" <crt () curesec com>

Bolt 2.2.4: Code Execution
Security Advisory – Curesec Research Team

1. Introduction

Affected Product:       Bolt 2.2.4
Fixed in:       2.2.5
Fixed Version Link:     <http://bolt.cm/distribution/archive/bolt-2.2.5.zip>
Vendor Contact:         Website: <https://bolt.cm>
Vulnerability Type:     Code Execution
Remote Exploitable:     Yes
Reported to vendor:     07/14/2015
Disclosed to public:    08/17/2015
Release mode:   Coordinated release
CVE:    n/a
Google Dork:    "This website is Built with Bolt" (About 11,100 results)
Credits         Tim Coen of Curesec GmbH

2. Vulnerability Description

The Bolt CMS does not allow the upload or editing of PHP files in its
admin area, which should prevent code execution once an attacker gained
admin credentials.

However, when uploading, the actual file type is not checked. The theme
editor allows for the renaming of uploaded files, and it does not check
the file extension or file type when doing so. Because of this, an
attacker can gain code execution.

Please note that admin credentials are required.

3. Proof of Concept

    Visit theme editor:
<http://localhost/bolt-git-2015-06-25-05c29bf/bolt/files/theme/base-2014>
    Upload or edit any existing file with allowed extension to contain
<?php passthru($_GET['e']);
    Rename the file, giving it an extension that will make it
executable, eg .php

The file will not be shown in the theme editor anymore, because PHP
files are not shown, but it will be accessible via eg
<http://localhost/bolt-git-2015-06-25-05c29bf/theme/base-2014/README.php>

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 2.2.5:

<http://bolt.cm/distribution/archive/bolt-2.2.5.zip>

Please note that a newer version might already be available.

5. Report Timeline

07/14/2015      Informed Vendor about Issue
07/24/2015      Vendor releases Version 4.2.3
08/17/2015      Disclosed to public

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
