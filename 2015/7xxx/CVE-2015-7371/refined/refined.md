    "CVE-2015-7371": {
      "root_cause": "The `run-mpe.php` script, which is used by the admin UI to asynchronously trigger the Maintenance Priority Engine, lacked proper authentication and access control.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated third party could trigger the Maintenance Priority Engine. While a locking mechanism prevents concurrent runs, repeated calls can lead to resource exhaustion.",

        "An attacker can directly call the `run-mpe.php` script."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges to make the request."
