Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the SECURE DATA SPACE API. This allows attackers to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed arbitrary script code into the context of the Secure Data Space backend interface.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Stealing cookies.
    *   Attacking the browser and its components.
    *   Other potential malicious activities due to the wide range of capabilities available through the backend interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request (Proof-of-Concept #1):**
    *   By manipulating the `downloads` parameter in the API endpoint `/api/v3//public/shares/downloads/`, an attacker can inject malicious Javascript into the server's response.
*   **HTTP POST Request (Proof-of-Concept #2):**
    *   By injecting malicious Javascript code into the `authType` parameter of a POST request to `/api/v3/auth/login`.
*  **HTTP POST Request (Proof-of-Concept #3):**
    *   By injecting malicious Javascript code into the `login` parameter of a POST request to `/api/v3/auth/reset_password`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit these vulnerabilities, as indicated by the "unauthenticated" nature of the XSS flaws.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All product versions of SECURE DATA SPACE (Online, Dedicated, For Linux/Windows) in Web-Client v3.1.1-2.
*   restApiVersion: 3.5.7-FINAL.
*    sdsServerVersion: 3.4.14-FINAL.

**Vulnerability Fix:**

*   Update to Secure Data Space Versions: Web-Client 3.1.3 - Rev. 3 or higher with SDS-API 3.5.7 or higher.
