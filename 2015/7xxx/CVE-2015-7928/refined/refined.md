Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Passwords are transmitted in plain text over the network and are not encrypted.
*   The autocomplete feature of some eWON forms allows passwords to be retrieved from the browser's history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Transmission of Passwords:** Sensitive data like passwords are not encrypted when transmitted, making them vulnerable to interception.
*   **Insecure Password Storage in Browser:** The browser's autocomplete function can store and expose passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Compromise:** Attackers can easily obtain user credentials through network traffic interception or browser history access.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Successful compromise of user credentials would allow unauthorized access to the eWON device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can capture network traffic to intercept passwords sent in plain text.
*   **Browser Access:** Attackers with access to a user's browser can retrieve stored passwords through the autocomplete feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network where they can capture traffic between the user and the eWON device.
*   **Browser Access (optional):**  If the attacker does not have network access, they can compromise the machine of a user who has accessed the eWON device to retrieve stored credentials.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vendor's response to this issue was that the "final user is supposed to configure eWON through VPN" and considered the issue not critical.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity.
*   eWON partially mitigated this issue with its new updated firmware.
