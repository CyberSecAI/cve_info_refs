  "CVE-2015-7502": {
    "description": "A privilege escalation flaw was discovered in CloudForms, where in certain situations, CloudForms could read encrypted data from the database and then write decrypted data back into the database. If the database was then exported or log files generated, a local attacker might be able to gain access to sensitive information.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application decrypts sensitive data from the database, then writes the decrypted data back into the database, potentially exposing it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of encrypted data",
         "Privilege escalation"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could gain access to sensitive information by exporting the database or accessing log files containing decrypted data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Database export",
        "Accessing log files"
      ],
