Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7850:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the remote configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd). Specifically, it occurs when ntpd is configured to allow remote configuration and an attacker provides a crafted configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Infinite Loop:** A malicious configuration file can cause ntpd to enter an infinite loop. This happens when an attacker configures extended logging and points the key file to the log file. The repeated attempts to parse the log file as a key file trigger the endless loop.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises because ntpd doesn't properly check if the log and key files are the same, allowing for a loop to be created through remote configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. The infinite loop consumes resources, effectively making ntpd unresponsive and preventing it from performing its intended function of synchronizing time.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The infinite loop can also lead to the creation of a potentially large log file which can further exacerbate the denial of service due to disk space exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Configuration:** The attack is carried out via the remote configuration feature of ntpd.
*   **Crafted Configuration File:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted configuration file to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable ntpd server.
*   **Remote Configuration Access:**  The attacker must either know the remote configuration password or the ntpd server must be configured to disable authentication. Additionally, the attacker's source IP address must be allowed for remote configuration.
*   **Knowledge of Configuration Directives**: The attacker needs to understand the ntpd configuration directives to set up the infinite loop by making the logfile and keyfile the same.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Yves Younan of Cisco Talos.
*   The issue was resolved in ntp version 4.2.8p4 and later.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entries indicate that the issue can be triggered using the `:config` command
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory lists this CVE as part of a larger advisory with multiple NTP vulnerabilities
*   NetApp lists this as one of many CVE's fixed in their October 2015 NTP security advisory, and includes a CVSS score of 3.9 (Low) with the vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:C
*   The Debian Security Advisory indicates that remote configuration is disabled by default.
