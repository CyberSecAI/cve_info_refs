- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Control Panel executable `nvSmartMaxApp.exe` contains an unquoted path vulnerability. The process name paths lack double quotes when launching process threads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unquoted path vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could gain elevated privileges by inserting an executable file in the path of the affected process, allowing malicious code to execute with elevated privileges during Windows startup.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker can place a malicious executable in a directory within the unquoted path, which will then be executed when the vulnerable application attempts to launch a process using the unquoted path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to place an executable file in a directory within the unquoted path.
