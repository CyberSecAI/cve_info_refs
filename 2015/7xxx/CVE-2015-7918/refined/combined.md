ICS Advisory
# Schneider Electric ProClima ActiveX Control Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-335-02

## OVERVIEW

Ariele Caltabiano, working with HP’s Zero Day Initiative, has identified 11 remote code execution vulnerabilities in Schneider Electric’s ProClima F1 Bookview ActiveX control application. Schneider Electric has produced an update to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Schneider Electric reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following versions of ProClima:

* Version 6.1 and prior.

## IMPACT

These vulnerabilities can be used to modify arbitrary memory and lead to remote code execution.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Schneider Electric’s corporate headquarters is located in Paris, France, and maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.

The affected product, ProClima, is a configuration utility used to design control panel enclosures to accommodate the thermal load from the electrical/electronic devices inside and from the environment. According to Schneider Electric, ProClima is used across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, and Energy. Schneider Electric estimates that this product is used primarily in the United States and Europe with a small percentage in Asia.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### REMOTE CODE EXECUTIONCWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (“Code Injection”), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html, web site last accessed December 01, 2015.

ProClima has 11 vulnerabilities that allow code injection. This could allow the attacker to cause a crash or to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-7918NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-7918, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report. This web site will be active sometime after publication of this advisory. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).CVSS Calculator, https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L , web site last accessed December 01, 2015.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### EXPLOITABILITY

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

#### EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

#### DIFFICULTY

An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## MITIGATION

Schneider Electric has developed an update for ProClima software. The update is available at the following URL:

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range-download/2560-proclima>.

For more information on this vulnerability and the associated patch, please see Schneider Electric’s SEVD-2015-329-01, released November 25, 2015:

<http://www.schneider-electric.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2015-329-01>

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

## Schneider Electric ProClima F1BookView ActiveX Control DefinedName Method Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-630ZDI-CAN-3076

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-7918](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7918) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Schneider Electric](http://www.schneider-electric.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [ProClima](http://www.schneider-electric.com/proclima-software) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['20652']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric ProClima. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the DefinedName method. Memory corruption occurs when a long user-supplied name is supplied. Later in processing, the code jumps to an address outside of normal flow. An attacker may be able to leverage this flaw to execute code under the context of the process. |
