Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the netlink module during socket creation. This race can lead to a kernel panic in the `netlink_release->module_put` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a race condition.
- It occurs specifically within the `NETLINK_NFLOG` socket creation process.
- The vulnerability is triggered when multiple operations occur concurrently during netlink socket creation.
- The flaw is related to the backported `nf_log_register` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation results in a kernel panic, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local users creating netlink sockets can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The `nfnetlink_log` module must be loaded for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- No special user privileges beyond local access appear to be necessary.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The issue was introduced in kernel version `3.10.0-304.el7` through a fix related to protecting `nf_log_register` against double registering.
- The vulnerability is specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux and does not affect upstream kernels.
- The issue is a result of backporting netfilter functionality while maintaining KABI (Kernel Application Binary Interface) compatibility.
