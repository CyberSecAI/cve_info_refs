Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7946:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `mtp-server` (Media Transfer Protocol server) interacts with the greeter service on Ubuntu mobile devices. Specifically, the `mtp-server` relies on the greeter service's DBus signals to determine when to become active and make the device's storage accessible via MTP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is a timing issue in the greeter service. When transitioning between the emergency dialer and the greeter screen, the greeter briefly signals an inactive state to `mtp-server`.  This triggers `mtp-server` to become active, even though the device is locked. A race condition exists where the greeter briefly advertises the inactive state before fully transitioning back to a locked greeter state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation leads to information exposure. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device's storage via MTP without unlocking the device. This means an attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the phone.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating the device's state to trigger the greeter's incorrect signaling during the transition between the emergency dialer and the greeter screen.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs physical access to the device. The attacker needs to be able to initiate an emergency call and then cancel the call to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `unity8` version `8.11+16.04.20160111.1-0ubuntu1`
*   A merge proposal was created and merged into the unity8 trunk to address the issue.
*   The fix involved preventing the emergency dialer from unintentionally exposing the MTP service by addressing the timing gap.
