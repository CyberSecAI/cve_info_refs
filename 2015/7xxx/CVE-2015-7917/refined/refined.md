Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element. The application loads DLL files from an insecure location, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The application does not properly validate the location of the DLL files it loads, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking. It loads a DLL from a location where a malicious user can place a crafted file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation grants an attacker the same privilege level as the application that loads the malicious DLL. This could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities on the affected system, depending on the application's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves local access to the target machine. An attacker needs to place a crafted DLL on the victim's machine in a location where the application searches for DLLs.
- The attack is triggered when a user runs the vulnerable application, and the application attempts to load the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files to the file system on the target machine where the vulnerable application looks for DLLs.
- Social engineering is required to convince the victim to accept the malformed DLL file and trigger the loading of the malicious DLL by running the vulnerable application.
