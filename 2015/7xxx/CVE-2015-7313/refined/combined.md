| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1265998#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-09-24 09:36:53 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way libtiff parsed certain tiff files. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would cause an application using libtiff to exhaust all available memory on the system.  Original report:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/601>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1265998#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-09-24 09:37:49 UTC  ```  Created libtiff tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1265999](show_bug.cgi?id=1265999 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-7313 libtiff: OOM when parsing crafted tiff files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1265998#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-09-24 09:37:54 UTC  ```  Created mingw-libtiff tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1266000](show_bug.cgi?id=1266000 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-7313 mingw-libtiff: libtiff: OOM when parsing crafted tiff files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1265998#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-10-07 10:48:48 UTC  ``` On Fedora and RHEL7, disabling memory overcommit (echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory) seems to "fix" this issue. Thus, there is nothing wrong with the libtiff code. Instead, the memory overcommit will prevent certain memory errors to be passed to the libtiff code, ultimately "bypassing" the libtiff error checks, leading to an OOM kill instead of a libtiff exit.   On RHEL6, it detects and integer overflow and exits: TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, oom.tif: Bogus "StripByteCounts" field, ignoring and calculating from imagelength. oom.tif: Integer overflow in TIFFVStripSize. TIFFReadDirectory: oom.tif: cannot handle zero strip size.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1265998#c4)  Federico Leva    2015-10-26 14:45:28 UTC  ``` A variant with "bus error" was seen libtiff 3.4 <http://markmail.org/message/igqy46wj7kzhnkjv>   ``` |  |

# DoS in libtiff

---

*From*: Gustavo Grieco <gustavo.grieco () gmail com>

*Date*: Mon, 21 Sep 2015 12:02:10 -0300

---

```
Hi,

We found a DoS using a crafted tiff file that causes a OOM kill in low memory
system (usually less than 3GB). This was tested in Ubuntu 14.04 (64bit) but the
issue exists even in the CVS libtiff version. Please find attached the
compressed test case (otherwise it can kill my browser since gdk-pixbuf is
loading tiff files in the preview dialog!). You can test it executing:

$ tiffdither oom.tif /dev/null

If you run it with ltrace, you can see some very large reallocs:

libtiff.so.5->realloc(0, 1636178024)
             = 0x7f71a42b6010
libtiff.so.5->realloc(0, 1636178024)
             = 0x7f7142a54010

Upstream was notified but there is still no fix.

Regards,

Gustavo.

```

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libTIFF, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.7** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifier and bug reports referenced for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
image file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.7"

```
