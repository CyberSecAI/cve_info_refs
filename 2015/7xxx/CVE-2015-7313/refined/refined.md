Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how libtiff parses certain crafted TIFF files. Specifically, the issue involves the processing of "StripByteCounts" field, potentially leading to an integer overflow, which can cause a large memory allocation when processing the strip size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The libtiff library is susceptible to an integer overflow when processing the "StripByteCounts" field in a specially crafted TIFF file.
- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The integer overflow leads to the allocation of a very large memory block, potentially causing out-of-memory conditions when processing the strip size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to create a specially crafted TIFF file that, when processed by an application using libtiff, will lead to the exhaustion of all available system memory. This can result in the application crashing or becoming unresponsive, effectively causing a denial-of-service.
- **Bus Error:** In some cases, specifically with older versions of libtiff (3.4), a "bus error" may occur instead of an OOM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted TIFF File:** The attack vector involves delivering a malicious TIFF file to a target system. This file contains specific parameters in the "StripByteCounts" field that trigger the integer overflow vulnerability in libtiff.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability can be triggered when an application using libtiff attempts to process this crafted TIFF file. This could include image viewers, converters, or any application utilizing libtiff for TIFF image handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted TIFF file designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **File Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious TIFF file to a system running software that utilizes the vulnerable libtiff library. This could be done through a variety of means such as email attachments, web uploads or by tricking users into opening the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the TIFF file, when libtiff attempts to process the "StripByteCounts" field, which determines the size of strips in a tiled image.
- Disabling memory overcommit on certain systems might prevent the OOM condition, although it does not address the underlying flaw.
- RHEL6 detects the integer overflow, issues a warning, and exits, whereas Fedora and RHEL7 can be affected by memory exhaustion depending on the memory overcommit settings.
- The issue was originally reported with a test case causing an OOM condition.
- The vulnerability has been reported to affect even the CVS version of libtiff as of the time of the initial report (2015).
