    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2015-7176",
      "Description": "The AnimationThread function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 uses an incorrect argument to the sscanf function, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The `sscanf` function was used with an incorrect format specifier and without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking with sscanf."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a specially crafted input file.",
      "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can control the content of the operating system file parsed by the `AnimationThread` function." ,
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a way to modify the contents of the file parsed by the `AnimationThread`, which is an operating system controlled file."

 "CVE-2015-7177": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2015-7177",
      "Description": "The InitTextures function in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The `InitTextures` function calls `IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect` without proper error handling. It checks for a NULL pointer in the `pBits` member of the `D3DLOCKED_RECT` structure but does not check the return code of the `LockRect` function, resulting in the usage of a wild pointer when locking fails.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Use of a wild pointer due to missing return code check from `IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect`.",
          "Memory corruption when `LockRect` fails and an uninitialized `D3DLOCKED_RECT` structure is used."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code by causing `LockRect()` to fail and triggering a memory overwrite via the use of an invalid `aLockedRect` pointer.  The memory corruption is likely an overwrite of the stack, making exploitation more likely.",
      "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by causing the `IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect` call to fail, which results in an arbitrary memory write due to the wild pointer. The source of the surface determines how easily the exploit can be reached by an attacker. A source derived from rendered web content is more easily manipulated by an attacker than something like a const color fill.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs a way to influence the memory allocation to cause `LockRect` to fail and also have a degree of control over the memory being written to as it overwrites the stack with an invalid pointer."
