Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Mozilla Firefox handles `data:` and `view-source:` URIs. The browser incorrectly processes these URIs, allowing a bypass of the same-origin policy. Specifically, it fails to prevent these URIs from accessing resources from different origins, including cross-site URLs and local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the same-origin policy, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers designed to prevent scripts from one origin from accessing resources from another origin.
*   **Cross-Site Data Access:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to potentially read data from cross-site URLs, effectively violating the confidentiality of resources from other domains.
*   **Local File Access:** An attacker could leverage this flaw to read local files on the user's system, again a violation of confidentiality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:**  An attacker could steal sensitive information from other websites.
*   **Local File Exposure:** An attacker could gain access to potentially sensitive data stored in local files on the user's computer.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The cross-site reading capability allows an attacker to potentially gather information about a user's activity across different websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Web Page:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page that exploits this vulnerability by utilizing the flawed behavior of `data:` and `view-source:` URIs.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to load the malicious page or trigger the vulnerability within a browser context.
*   **Email:** While generally not exploitable directly through email due to the disabling of scripting, the Thunderbird component is listed as vulnerable, so there is a possibility an email could trigger this in a browser like context (or if scripting was enabled).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, requiring only the ability to serve a malicious web page.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** No user authentication is needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content indicates this vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS, and Thunderbird.
*   The issue is resolved in Firefox 43, Firefox ESR 38.5, Firefox OS 2.5, and Thunderbird 38.5.
*   The vulnerability is specific to how Firefox handles the schemes and is not just a generic browser flaw.
*   Mozilla acknowledged Tsubasa Iinuma as the original reporter of this issue.
