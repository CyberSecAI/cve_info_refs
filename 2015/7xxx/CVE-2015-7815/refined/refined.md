Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `viewDataTable` request parameter in the `/core/ViewDataTable/Factory.php` script. This unsanitized input is then directly used in a `class_exists()` function call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `viewDataTable` parameter is not checked or sanitized before being used in a `class_exists()` call.
*   **File Inclusion:** Because `class_exists()` triggers the autoloader in PHP, an attacker can use this to include arbitrary PHP files by specifying a class name that is mapped to a file, either within the Piwik codebase or outside of it.
*   **Autoloading Abuse:** The Composer autoloading functionality is leveraged to achieve arbitrary file inclusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can include and potentially execute arbitrary PHP files.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This can lead to unauthorized access to Piwik functionalities or the server itself, potentially compromising the application and the data it handles.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Parameter:**  The `viewDataTable` parameter in an HTTP request is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Piwik instance.
*   **PHP Version:** The vulnerability is exploitable when the Piwik application is running on PHP versions prior to 5.4.24 or 5.5.8.
*   **Understanding of Autoloading:** The attacker must understand how PHP autoloading works.
