Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a privilege escalation issue within the IBM Data Protection Extension used in the VMware GUI component of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware and IBM Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for VMware. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how the Data Protection Extension handles user privileges during a restore operation of virtual machines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user, lacking the required permissions to restore a virtual machine, can still initiate the restore operation.
- **Bypass Access Control:** The user is able to bypass the intended access control checks, allowing them to access data they should not be able to.
- **Creation of New VM:** Instead of overwriting the original VM, the restore function creates a new virtual machine with the same data, circumventing security measures that may exist on the original VM.
- **Access to Unencrypted Data:** The newly created VM contains the same data as the original VM and the user can access the data without the required permissions or the data encryption that might be in place on the original.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data from virtual machines they are not authorized to access.
- **Data Exposure:** Even if the original virtual machine had access restrictions, the attacker will be able to access the data within the restored virtual machine.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The attacker can expose sensitive information contained within virtual machines, potentially resulting in a significant confidentiality breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the VMware environment.
- **VMware vSphere Web Client GUI:** The vulnerability is exploited through the VMware vSphere Web Client GUI where the IBM Data Protection Extension is installed.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the vSphere Web Client, even if they do not have restore permissions on the targeted virtual machines.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the vSphere Web Client GUI.
- **Basic User Permissions:** The attacker does not require special admin permissions, but needs to have access to the vSphere Web Client.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** Knowledge about how to initiate a restore via the IBM Data Protection Extension.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.3.x of Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware and versions 4.1.0.0 through 4.1.3.x of Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for VMware.
- Patches are available for both products in the 7.1.4 and 4.1.4 release levels, respectively.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations for the vulnerability.
