# Security Bulletin: Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware and Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for VMware affected by privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2015-7429)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM Data Protection Extension in the VMware GUI component of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware (IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments) and IBM Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for VMware (IBM Spectrum Protect Snapshot) are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability that can result in an authenticated user being able to restore a virtual machine even though the user does not have the required privilege for this operation.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7429](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7429) The IBM Data Protection Extension in the Tivoli Storage Manager and FlashCopy Manager Data Protection for VMware GUI has a privilege escalation vulnerability. When the IBM Data Protection Extension is installed in the VMware vSphere Web Client GUI, it is possible for an authenticated user to select an existing virtual machine from the vSphere inventory and perform a Restore operation even though the user does not have the required privilege for the operation. The restore operation will not overwrite the existing virtual machine, but instead will create a new virtual machine with the same data as the existing virtual machine. After the restore creates the new virtual machine, the user can access its unencrypted data, regardless of their access permissions to the existing virtual machine data.

CVSS Base Score: 8.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107858> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

The affected GUI is part of the following products and versions:

* Tivoli Storage Manager for Virtual Environments: Data Protection for VMware 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.3.x
* Tivoli Storage FlashCopy Manager for VMware 4.1.0.0 through 4.1.3.x
