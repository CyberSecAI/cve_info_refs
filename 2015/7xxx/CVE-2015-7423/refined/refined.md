- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site, potentially stealing cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted URL that, when clicked, triggers the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. The attacker does not need any special access or position on the server to exploit this vulnerability.
