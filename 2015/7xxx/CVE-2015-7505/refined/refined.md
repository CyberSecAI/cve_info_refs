The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the libnsgif library, identified as CVE-2015-7505.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how libnsgif processes LZW-compressed GIF data. Specifically, the `gif_next_LZW()` function writes data onto the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack overflow:** The `gif_next_LZW()` function writes to a stack buffer using `*stack_pointer++` without proper validation. The loop continues as long as `code >= clear_code`, which, when processing a specially crafted image, leads to `stack_pointer` exceeding the stack boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:** A stack overflow can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided GDB output demonstrates a segmentation fault due to the stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted GIF image:** An attacker can craft a GIF image with specific LZW compressed data that forces the `gif_next_LZW()` function to write beyond the stack buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GIF image that is processed by an application using the vulnerable libnsgif library.
