Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7857:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate filtering of request data, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability within the Joomla Content History component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability in the Joomla Content History component. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection allows the attacker to retrieve active Super User session IDs.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By using the hijacked admin session, the attacker can login to the Joomla administrator backend. Subsequently, the attacker can create a new template file containing malicious code, thus achieving remote code execution on the server.
- **Full Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows full administrative control over the Joomla installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests to the `index.php` file.
- The vulnerable component is `com_contenthistory`.
- The attack exploits parameters such as `list[ordering]` and `list[select]` to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- No authentication is needed for initial SQL injection.
- The attacker must be able to access the administrator panel after obtaining the admin session cookie.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Joomla versions 3.2.0 through 3.4.4.
- The exploit requires the attacker to first retrieve the database table prefix, then exploit the SQL injection to steal the admin session cookie, and finally use the session cookie to achieve RCE via template manipulation.
- The exploit is possible due to the ability to insert malicious SQL into the `list[select]` parameter.
- The exploit uses a multi-step process, including retrieving table prefix, admin cookie, authenticating to administrator panel, creating a new template file, injecting payload into it, and finally executing it.
- Successful exploitation leads to a full compromise of the Joomla instance, providing RCE.

The provided information contains a detailed explanation of the exploit, including the SQL injection and the steps for achieving RCE through session hijacking and template manipulation. This is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
