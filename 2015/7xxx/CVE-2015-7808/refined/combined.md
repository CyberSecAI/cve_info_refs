# vBulletin Exploits in the Wild

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)   [Daniel Cid](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/dcid)

* November 4, 2015
 ![](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Disclosure-Image-Vbulletin-820x386.jpg)

*\*\*Update: CheckPoint disclosed more details here: [Check Point Discovers Critical vBulletin 0-Day](http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/11/05/check-point-discovers-critical-vbulletin-0-day/).*

The vBulletin team patched a serious object injection vulnerability yesterday, that can lead to full command execution on any site running on an out-of-date vBulletin version. The [patch](http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?p=2558144#post2558144) supports the latest versions, from 5.1.4 to 5.1.9.

The vulnerability is serious and easy to exploit; it was used to hack and deface the main [vBulletin.com](http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?p=2558196#post2558196) website. As a precaution, all passwords were reset; you will have to create a new one before you can access vbulletin.com again and download the patches.

##### Exploits in the Wild

This vulnerability seems to have been around for a bit. We were able to trace exploit attempts to the end of October, they were targeting a few high profile vBulletin sites protected by our [Website Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/).

The exploit was [shared publicly](http://pastie.org/pastes/10527766/text?key=wq1hgkcj4afb9ipqzllsq) yesterday. It attacks the **decodeArguments** Ajax API hook. Here is an example of an exploit attempt in the wild:

> 108.47.xx.yy – – [02/Nov/2015:22:18:21 -0500] “GET /vbforum[/]ajax/api/hook/decodeArguments?
>  arguments=O%3A12%3A%22vB\_dB\_Result%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A5%3A%22%00%2a%00
>  db%22%3BO%3A11%3A%22vB\_Database%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22functions%22
>  %3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A11%3A%22free\_result%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22phpinfo%22
>  %3B%7D%7Ds%3A12%3A%22%00%2a%00recordset%22%3Bi%3A1%3B%7D%22

Once decoded, it executes:

> vB\_Database”:1:{s:9:”functions”;a:1:{s:11:”free\_result”;s:7:”phpinfo”;}}s:12:”

This shows the attacker the result of **phpinfo** indicating that his exploit succeeded. If this test payload works, the attacker will proceed with a full compromise. We are not seeing widespread exploitation attempts yet, as just a few high profile sites were targeted, but we expect it to change soon as it makes its way into the automation engines.

### Patch and Protect

If we have not emphasized before, you have to **patch your vBulletin site now**! Websites behind our [WAF](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall) are (and always were) protected against this vulnerability due to our virtual hardening technology. If you can not patch your vBulletin site, we recommend looking at a solution to stop these exploits before they reach you.

   What kind of OOTB defences do you have against such attacks? I assume you don’t block any request with “phpinfo” in it..

   1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df3ec5506ba59d2ed3b951b7057e97d0?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **[Daniel Cid](http://dcid.me)** says: [November 4, 2015 at 11:20 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/11/vbulletin-exploits-in-the-wild.html#comment-6948)

      We have protection against generic object injection attacks, which patches this specific vulnerability. We also have specific virtual hardening for vBulletin that blocks access to the vulnerable file path.

      Hope it clarifies.

      thanks,

# Check Point Discovers Critical vBulletin 0-Day

![author image](/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/author-image.png)
By**Check Point Research Team**

Share

vBulletin is a commercial forum and blog platform developed by vBulletin Solutions, Inc. It was created over 10 years ago and is written in PHP. It is the world’s most popular forum platform, powering ~78% out of the forums in the top 100K web-sites. Currently there are estimated to be over 40,000 live sites using vBulletin.

A month ago, Check Point privately reported a critical unauthenticated RCE vulnerability to vBulletin support. This vulnerability was independently discovered by Netanel Rubin, and assigned CVE-2015-7808.

When exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute PHP code on any vBulletin server without requiring user authentication. It does not require any themes or modules other than the ones installed by default.

As widely reported, the main vBulletin.org forum was compromised earlier this week and an exploit for a vBulletin 0-day was up for sale in online markets.

A patch later released by vBulletin fixes the vulnerability reported, but fails to neither credit any reporting nor mention the appropriate CVE number.

As the vulnerability is now fixed and an exploit exists in the wild with public analyses, we follow with the technical description as submitted to vBulletin.

If you administer any vBulletin web site, we urge you to apply the patch as soon as possible, as exploitation risk is imminent.

It is important to note the analyzed public exploit shows a different chain than the one we used for our PoC; therefore we cannot link the attacks directly to our report.

**Disclosure Timeline**

**Technical Description**

vBulletin handles a lot of the heavy lifting through an internal API. Unfortunately parts of that API are also used as a gate for Ajax requests, and as a result this API is also accessible through the regular CGI.

This API does not validate the origin of the request, allowing us to access any part of its interface. That interface, in fact, allows us to call any public method in any class that inherits from ‘vB\_Api’ and located in ‘/core/vb/api/’. This folder contains dozens of classes and hundreds of methods for us to use as an attack surface, and as noted, some of them considered internal methods. Moreover, we can call these methods with any arguments we’d like, as the API doesn’t have any sort of argument white listing.

Our findings begin with the vulnerable method ‘vB\_Api\_Hook::decodeArguments()’, which, again, requires no authentication, and at its first line of code contains an ‘unserialize’ call. This can be seen in the following code:

[![pic 1](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-11.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-11.png)

Because we control the ‘$arguments’ parameter we can also control what goes into the ‘unserialize()’ call. That means we can actually craft and inject any object we’d like into the ‘$args’ variable.

PHP objects share several ‘magic methods’ that get called automatically whenever specific events occur. Such a trigger event, for example, is the destruction of an object (the ‘\_\_destruct()’ method gets called), or an attempt to use an object as a string, triggering its ‘\_\_toString()’ method.

That means we can now trigger a call to any ‘\_\_destruct()’ method for any defined class. We only set our object to be of that type, and when the ‘decodeArguments()’ function returns, that object will get destructed.

Examine the following interesting destructor for vB\_vURL:

[![pic 2](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-22.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-22.png)

This method takes the ‘tmpfile’ property and treats it as a file name that, if exists, gets deleted.

This can obviously be exploited to remove any file accessible to the web server, most likely rendering the server inoperable, or even causing permanent data loss. However, we are after higher goals. We can leverage this code to gain more access to protected methods in objects. If we insert *another* object into ‘tmpfile’, an attempt to convert it into a string will happen once the ‘file\_exists()’ call is reached. In effect, this now added all ‘\_\_toString()’ methods to our widening attacking surface.

Take a look at vB\_View’s ‘\_\_toString()’:

[![pic 3](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-32.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-32.png)

This ‘\_\_toString()’ make a call to vB\_View’s ‘render()’ method right off the bat. Unfortunately, this base ‘render()’ method doesn’t do anything of interest for our exploitation purposes. Consider, however, the ‘vB\_View\_AJAXHTML’ class, inheriting from vB\_View, and implementing a very different ‘render()’ method:

[![pic 4](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-41.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-41.png)

As seen above, this ‘render()’ calls another ‘render()’, for the object under the ‘content’ property. Since we can control that one, too, we can now target our ‘render()’ call at *any* class (not only vB\_View objects).

This leads us to the ‘vB5\_Template’ class, which implements its own ‘render()’ method:

[![pic 5](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-51.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-51.png)

Basically, this method loads a template from the cache or DB using the template name specified in the ‘template’ property. Afterwards, it evals or includes it based on the template type.

Because the template name is only used inside a (properly escaped) SQL query, we can’t use it for a LFI attempt. Still, this allows us to load any template we want from the DB.

Let’s look at the ‘widget\_php’ template code:

[![pic 6](https://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-61.png)](http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pic-61.png)

The ‘code’ value in the ‘$widgetConfig’ dictionary is the argument for a function which (ultimately) evals its content. If we could control this variable, we would be able to execute any PHP code we’d like on the server.

Let’s see how we do exactly that.

The ‘render()’ method at the ‘vB5\_Template’ class call the ‘extract()’ function with the ‘$this->registered’ as an argument. As some readers may observe, ’extract()’ receives a key-value dictionary as an argument and adds the key-value pairs as variables and respective values to the current scope. Because we control ‘$this->registered’, we can add any variable and value to the current scope.

Finally, we add the ‘$widgetConfig’ variable to the ‘registered’ property, set its value as a dictionary containing ‘code’ as a key and our exploit PHP code as its value.

**POC**

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
