Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-7615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs when handling PDF documents containing media content. Specifically, when attempting to save a specially crafted PDF, a dangling pointer is reused after it has been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A memory location is freed, but a pointer to that location is still used, leading to potentially corrupt memory access and control-flow hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (the user's instance of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC). This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF Document:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF document that triggers the vulnerability when the user attempts to save it.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to either open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable save operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF document to the target user. This can be done through various means like email attachments, links on websites, or social engineering tactics.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the specific structure required within the media content of a PDF file to trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
- The vulnerability was patched in a security update released on October 13, 2015.
- The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of HP Zero Day Initiative.
