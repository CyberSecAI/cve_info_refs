## Amped Wireless R10000 router contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#763576

Original Release Date: 2015-12-10 | Last Revised: 2015-12-10

---

### Overview

Amped Wireless R10000 router, firmware version 2.5.2.11, uses default credentials, is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, and uses insufficiently random values for DNS queries.

### Description

| [**CWE-255**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html)**: Credentials Management** - CVE-2015-7277  The Amped Wireless R10000 web administration interface uses non-random default credentials of admin:admin. A local area network attacker can gain privileged access to a vulnerable device's web management interfaces or leverage default credentials in remote attacks such as cross-site request forgery.[**CWE-352**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) -** CVE-2015-7278The Amped Wireless R10000 contains a global CSRF vulnerability. An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. Note that in combination with default credentials, an attacker can establish an active session as part of an attack and therefore would not require a victim to be logged in.The CVSS score below reflects CVE-2015-7278.[**CWE-330**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)**: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - CVE-2015-7279The Amped Wireless R10000 uses static source ports and predictable TXIDs that increment from 0x0002 for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). An attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can cause R10000 LAN clients to contact incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control.The following graph shows a distribution of 264 DNS queries captured on the WAN port of the R10000: |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to spoof DNS responses to cause R10000 LAN clients to contact attacker-controlled hosts or induce an authenticated user into making an unintentional request to the web server that will be treated as an authentic request. A local area network attacker can take complete control of a device using default admin credentials. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Until these vulnerabilities are addressed, users should consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access and use strong passwords**As a general good security practice, only allow trusted hosts to connect to the LAN. Implement strong passwords for WiFi and for the web management interface. Strong passwords can help to prevent blind guessing attempts that would establish sessions for CSRF attacks. LAN hosts should not browse the Internet while the web management interface has an active session in a browser tab.Note that there are no practical workarounds for the DNS spoofing vulnerability, as general users are unlikely to be able to monitor traffic entering the router's WAN port. |
