Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-7278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Amped Wireless R10000 router has a global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (CWE-352):** The router's web interface lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a logged-in victim user.
- If default credentials are in use, the attacker can establish a session and perform actions even without a logged-in user. This would mean that the victim need not be logged in to the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious request, often embedded in a link, email or website.
- A victim with an active session is induced (e.g., by clicking on the link) to trigger the malicious request.
- The router's web interface, lacking CSRF protections, executes the request as if it came from the legitimate user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim user to trigger the malicious request. This typically means the victim would have to visit a malicious site or click a malicious link.
- In the case where the default credentials have not been changed, no user interaction is required, as the attacker can directly establish a session.
- This is a remote unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The content explicitly mentions the combination with default credentials (CVE-2015-7277) increases the impact of CSRF vulnerability.
- The provided CVSS score of 6.8 (Base score) is for CVE-2015-7278
