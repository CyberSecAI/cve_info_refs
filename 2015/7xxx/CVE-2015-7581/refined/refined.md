    "description": "actionpack/lib/action\_dispatch/routing/route\_set.rb in Action Pack in Ruby on Rails 4.x before 4.2.5.1 and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (superfluous caching and memory consumption) by leveraging an application's use of a wildcard controller route.",
    "vulnerability": "Object leak vulnerability for wildcard controller routes in Action Pack",
     "affected_component": "Action Pack component's caching of controller references",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an object leak due to the use of wildcard controller routes, which leads to unbounded memory growth.",
