- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Xcode did not honor the .gitignore directive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to properly handle .gitignore files leading to potential unintended inclusion of files in repositories.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Intentionally untracked files may be uploaded to repositories.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when using Xcode to commit changes to a repository where a .gitignore file exists.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to a git repository and be able to use Xcode to commit changes.
