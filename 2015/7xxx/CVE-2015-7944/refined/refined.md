Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-7944 and CVE-2015-7945:

**CVE-2015-7944: Unauthenticated Remote DoS**

*   **Root Cause:** The Ganeti RAPI daemon is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through excessive SSL renegotiation requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The RAPI daemon's handling of SSL renegotiation is inefficient, leading to high CPU usage when a malicious client initiates repeated renegotiation attempts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause resource exhaustion on the Ganeti master node by sending a continuous stream of SSL renegotiation requests, potentially leading to a denial of service, making the Ganeti cluster unavailable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a stream of 'R' characters to openssl s\_client, which triggers SSL renegotiation, leading to resource exhaustion. Alternatively, attackers can use tools like THC-SSL-DOS to achieve the same effect.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the Ganeti master node where the RAPI daemon is running and the ability to establish a TCP connection to the RAPI port, which is open on every interface by default, making it vulnerable to remote exploitation.

**CVE-2015-7945: Unauthenticated Remote Information Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The Ganeti RAPI daemon, by default, does not require authentication for certain read-only operations, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. The RAPI daemon also leaks the DRBD secret in job results.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The RAPI daemon listens on every interface by default and lacks authentication for read-only requests.
    *   Sensitive information, including network configuration, DRBD secrets, `osparams_secret`, LVM VG and LG names, and DRBD configuration are exposed via the RAPI interface through job results.
    *   The DRBD secret, which is stored in `/var/lib/ganeti/config.data`, can be extracted from job data through the RAPI.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can gain access to the network topology of the Ganeti cluster, the DRBD secret, and other sensitive parameters.
    *   With knowledge of the DRBD secret, an attacker can potentially gain access to the file systems of virtual machines by impersonating a DRBD node and synchronizing the disks, potentially leading to complete compromise of the virtual machines.
    *  Attackers could add SSH keys to gain unauthorized access and modify system files within the VMs.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending unauthenticated HTTP requests to the RAPI daemon to obtain job results containing the sensitive information. A tool called `GHETTO-BLASTER` was created to automate the retrieval of this information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the Ganeti master node where the RAPI daemon is running.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access the vulnerable RAPI endpoints.
    *   To exploit the information gathered for VM compromise, the attacker needs to be on the same network segment and be able to perform ARP poisoning or another man-in-the-middle technique.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect Ganeti versions up to and including 2.9.6, 2.10.7, 2.11.7, 2.12.5, 2.13.2, 2.14.1 and 2.15.1.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Pierre Kim.
*   The fix involves updating Ganeti to versions 2.9.7, 2.10.8, 2.11.8, 2.12.6, 2.13.3, 2.14.2 and 2.15.2 or higher.
*   Workarounds include:
    *   Forcing the RAPI daemon to listen on 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0.
    *   Adding authentication to the RAPI daemon for read-only access.
    *   Filtering the output of jobs to avoid leaking secrets.
    *   Disabling SSL renegotiation and updating default ciphers.
*   The provided information includes more detail than the official CVE descriptions, such as the step-by-step process of how the DRBD secret can be leveraged to compromise virtual machines.
