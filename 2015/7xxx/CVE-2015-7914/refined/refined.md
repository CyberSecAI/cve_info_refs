Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-7914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Credential Storage:** The moduWeb Vision application stores credential elements in an encrypted format, but uses the same encryption scheme as the authentication mechanism. This allows for a "pass-the-hash" attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CVE-2015-7914: Insecure Credential Storage (CWE-311):** Credentials are not adequately protected, allowing for potential reuse of stored, hashed credentials to bypass authentication. This is due to the system using the same encryption for authentication tokens as for stored credentials.
*   **CVE-2015-7915: Insecure Transmission of Credentials (CWE-319):** The application transmits credentials in plain text.
*   **CVE-2015-7916: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The web server allows for queries that enable an attacker to obtain and change protected information, and to redirect users to malicious locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanisms of the application, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate privileges to administrator level by exploiting the insecure storage of authentication tokens.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can add, modify accounts and credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain full control over the system and associated email accounts used for notifications.
*    **Network Reconnaissance:** An attacker can use XSS to engage in network reconnaissance.
*    **Malicious Code Injection:** XSS vulnerabilities can lead to attackers planting backdoor programs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need access to the network where the moduWeb Vision system is running.
*   **Web Interface:** The cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in the web interface.
*    **Plain Text Transmission:** Attackers can eavesdrop on network traffic to obtain credentials transmitted in plain text.
*    **Pass-the-Hash:** Attackers can leverage the improperly encrypted credentials stored by the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit requires low skill level.
*    **Network Access:** The attacker needs some form of network access to the affected system, either through direct access or via remote network connectivity.
*    **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic:**  For exploiting the cleartext transmission, an attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic.
*    **Ability to Access Web Interface:**  For the XSS and other web based attack vectors, an attacker needs to be able to access the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The "remember me" function uses cached credentials that are encrypted with the same method as backup passwords, allowing for privilege escalation.
*   Backups contain other encrypted configuration data which could further assist an attacker.
*   The system does not adequately protect configuration details, displaying credentials in plain text within the configuration when viewed by an administrator.
*   The vulnerabilities were identified by Martin Jartelius and John Stock of Outpost24.
*   Sauter has released a new firmware version 1.6.0 to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
