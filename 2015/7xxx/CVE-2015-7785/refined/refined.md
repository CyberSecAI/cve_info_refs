Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GANMA! App for iOS fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation. This means the app does not sufficiently check the authenticity and validity of the SSL certificate presented by the server, allowing for a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can eavesdrop on encrypted communications between the app and the server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive user data transmitted through the app.
- According to the provided CVSS scores, the confidentiality and integrity of data are at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, specifically a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the app and the server, like setting up a malicious Wi-Fi access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the app and the server. This can be achieved by:
    - Controlling a network access point used by the device.
    - Being on the same network as the device and using ARP spoofing, for example.
-  A high attack complexity is noted, which likely relates to the need for specific MITM setup and interception of communications.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable application is the GANMA! App for iOS, specifically version 2.0.9 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yuji Tounai to IPA, and JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer to address the issue.
- The weakness is categorized as "No Mapping(CWE-Other)" within JVN iPedia which means that the vulnerability did not map to an existing CWE category within the subset that they used at the time.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how it can be exploited, along with the necessary steps for remediation.
