Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Wget's behavior of falling back from passive FTP mode (PASV) to active FTP mode (PORT) when the passive connection fails. The PORT command in active mode transmits the client's IP address to the FTP server. This can be a privacy issue if the client intends to hide their IP address through a proxy or Tor, as the FTP server would learn the client's real IP address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the client's IP address, which was meant to be hidden through a proxy.
-   **Privacy Violation:** The fallback mechanism undermines the user's privacy and can lead to unexpected exposure of the client's actual location.
-   **Protocol Behavior:** The issue isn't directly with the FTP protocol itself, as the PORT command is a standard feature. The issue is wget's use of active mode as a fallback after passive mode failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privacy Loss:** An attacker controlling an FTP server or able to intercept the connection can uncover the client's real IP address.
-   **Circumvention of Anonymity:** Users relying on proxies (e.g., Tor) to anonymize their connections could have their real IP revealed.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious FTP Server:** An attacker can set up a malicious FTP server that intentionally refuses passive connections to trigger the fallback to active mode, thus obtaining the client's IP.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle:**  An attacker positioned as a man-in-the-middle could manipulate the FTP handshake to force the client to use active mode and disclose the IP.
-   **HTTP to FTP redirection:** An attacker could redirect a user from a HTTP site to a malicious FTP server, using active mode to reveal the client IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **FTP Server Control:** The attacker needs control of an FTP server or the ability to manipulate the FTP response to trigger the fallback to active mode.
-   **Network Positioning:** In a man-in-the-middle scenario, the attacker requires the ability to intercept and modify FTP traffic between the client and the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involved removing the fallback from passive to active mode in Wget, ensuring that if passive mode fails, active mode is not attempted, protecting the user's privacy.
- This CVE was specifically assigned to the Tails operating system, acknowledging that this behavior was a vulnerability in the context of their security goals.
- The fix was included in Wget version 1.16.4 and later.
- The issue is also related to the use of FTP protocol with IPv6 where active mode is more likely to succeed by default, increasing the likelihood of IP disclosure.
