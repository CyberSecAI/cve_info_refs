The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7255. The vulnerability note VU#566724 describes the widespread issue of embedded devices using non-unique X.509 certificates and SSH host keys. CVE-2015-7255 is specifically assigned to ZTE products affected by this issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Embedded devices are shipped with hard-coded, non-unique X.509 certificates and SSH host keys. This means multiple devices share the same cryptographic keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of hard-coded cryptographic keys (CWE-321).
- Non-unique X.509 certificates and SSH host keys across multiple devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Impersonation: Attackers can impersonate legitimate devices.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers can intercept and manipulate communications between devices and other entities.
- Passive decryption attacks: Attackers can decrypt communications that were encrypted using the shared keys.
- Potential to obtain credentials or sensitive information that can be used in further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or connect to the vulnerable device, they do not need to be authenticated.
