Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed through the `asc` or `desc` GET parameters in the `edit_marks.php` script. This unsanitized input is then directly incorporated into a string that is later executed using the `eval()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **PHP Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by manipulating the `asc` or `desc` GET parameters. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the user-provided input before being used in the `eval()` function.
- **Unsafe use of eval():** The `eval()` function is used in a dangerous way where a string assembled from user-controlled input is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to:
    - Complete compromise of the web application and server.
    - Data theft, modification, or deletion.
    - Installation of backdoors or malware.
    - Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `edit_marks.php` script. The malicious payload is placed in the `asc` or `desc` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs an account with the `AT_PRIV_GRADEBOOK` privilege in the ATutor application to directly exploit this vulnerability. This is required for accessing the vulnerable `edit_marks.php` page.
- **Bypass of Authentication:** As noted, this vulnerability can be exploited in conjunction with another vulnerability ([KIS-2015-06]) to bypass the authentication requirement, though details of this second vulnerability are not provided.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker must know the vulnerable `edit_marks.php` file path within the ATutor application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 04 November 2015, after the vendor failed to address it for over a year.
- The provided content gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the exact vulnerable code snippet and the timeline of vendor communication.
- The `addslashes` function is present, but it is insufficient for sanitizing user-provided data in this context because it doesn't prevent the attacker from injecting code through the `eval()` function.
