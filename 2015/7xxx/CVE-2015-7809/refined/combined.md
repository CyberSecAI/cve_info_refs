Package        : twig

James Kettle, Alain Tiemblo, Christophe Coevoet and Fabien Potencier
discovered that twig, a templating engine for PHP, did not correctly
process its input. End users allowed to submit twig templates could
use specially crafted code to trigger remote code execution, even in
sandboxed templates.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.2-1+deb8u1.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1.20.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your twig packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: CVE Request: twig remote code execution

Hello,

the symphony project released a security advisory for the Twig PHP library:
<http://symfony.com/blog/security-release-twig-1-20-0>

The linked GitHub pull requests provides the fixes:
<https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/pull/1759>

AFAICT there are least two issues: a remote code execution fixed by the "fixed
sandbox security issue" patch, and at least another issue regarding access to
"reserved macro names".

The RCE deserves a CVE IMO, but I'm not sure about the other one (or if it is
indeed only one issue).

Can CVE(s) be assigned for the above issue(s) as you deem appropriate?

Thanks

The MITRE CVE team doesn't have any straightforward way to satisfy CVE
requests about an uncertain set of vulnerabilities (e.g., "least two
issues" and "if it is indeed only one").

If the information had been broken down into specific independent
vulnerabilities with distinct discoverers, we would typically be able
to provide a separate CVE ID per discoverer; however, "I want to thank
James Kettle who was the first to report a RCE security issue, Alain
Tiemblo, Christophe Coevoet, and Fabien Potencier for finding more
possible and dangerous RCEs." doesn't really do that.

It's true that "Prevent importing or calling reserved macro names"
seems to correspond to a bug, but the listed references don't have any
statements about whether it's independently exploitable.

Similarly, the new code for "Accessing the environment from templates
is forbidden to prevent untrusted changes to the environment" in
a8a125ba9b31d20e8ad50e0d1078983ed7fa41a7 and
22500609b69a9f17a64102d9376cb114f706ee2f, which weren't mentioned in
the CVE request, seems like it is probably for a security-related bug
fix; however, again we don't know that it's independently exploitable.

So, what we'll do here is focus only on
30be07759a3de2558da5224f127d052ecf492e8f, which is described as "fixed
sandbox security issue" and suggests that the problem was that,
previously, a critical constraint of "A block must be a method on a
Twig_Template instance" wasn't being enforced. Use CVE-2015-7809 for
this 30be07759a3de2558da5224f127d052ecf492e8f issue.

# Security Release: Twig 1.20.0

August 12, 2015

•
Published by
[![Avatar of Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/images/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15.png?format=28x28)](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)
[Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)

I've just released Twig 1.20.0 which contains a security vulnerability fix for Twig's Sandbox mode.

## Description

Your application is affected if you allow end users to submit Twig templates, even if you protected this template with Twig's sandbox mode.

End users can craft valid Twig code that allows them to execute arbitrary code (RCEs) via the `_self` variable, which is always available, even in sandboxed templates.

## Affected Versions

All versions of Twig are affected.

## How to Patch

If you cannot upgrade, you can apply the patches provided in the [dedicated pull request](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/pull/1759).

## Credits

I want to thank James Kettle who was the first to report a RCE security issue, Alain Tiemblo, Christophe Coevoet, and Fabien Potencier for finding more possible and dangerous RCEs.

Thank you Christophe Coevoet, Tugdual Saunier, and Fabien Potencier for providing the fixes for the various attack vectors.

## Check your Project

As a quick remember, you can check your projects using Composer for vulnerability issues with the [SensioLabs Security Checker](https://security.sensiolabs.org/).
