Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Twig, a templating engine for PHP, handles block calls within sandboxed environments. Specifically, the code responsible for rendering blocks did not enforce that the called block is a method on a `Twig_Template` instance. This lack of verification allowed an attacker to bypass the sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The core issue is a sandbox bypass vulnerability. Twig's sandbox mode was intended to prevent untrusted code execution. However, by exploiting the lack of block verification, an attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:**  The Twig template engine did not properly validate the type of object being called as a block, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By crafting malicious Twig templates, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server where the Twig template is processed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Twig Templates:** The primary attack vector involves submitting specially crafted Twig templates that exploit the missing type check.
- **End-user Supplied Templates:** Applications that allow end-users to submit Twig templates are vulnerable if these templates are processed with Twig's sandboxing feature enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit or inject Twig templates into an application that processes them using the vulnerable version of the Twig library.
- The attacker does not need to have any elevated privileges beyond the ability to submit a template and have the application process it.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix was implemented by adding a type check to ensure that the template being called is actually a `Twig_Template` instance. This prevents the injection of arbitrary objects to bypass sandbox restrictions
- The vulnerability is located in the `displayBlock` function within the `Twig/Template.php` file.
- Multiple individuals are credited with discovering and reporting the issue, including James Kettle, Alain Tiemblo, Christophe Coevoet and Fabien Potencier.
