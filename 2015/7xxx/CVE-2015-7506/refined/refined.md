Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7506:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how libnsgif processes LZW-compressed GIF data. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read can occur in the `gif_next_LZW` function.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `gif_next_LZW` function accesses the `table` array using the `code` variable as an index. The code does not properly validate the value of the `code` before using it as an index, which can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the `table` array.
*   The code attempts a fix by comparing `code` against `max_code`. However, this fix isn't sufficient because the original value of `code` that caused the issue is still used for further processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to crashes and information disclosure. In some instances, this can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the memory.
*   The provided gdb output shows that the out-of-bounds read leads to a crash (segmentation fault).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted malicious GIF image.
*   The attacker needs to provide a GIF image that has the `set_code_size` value set to 0xc, which causes `clear_code` to be 4096.
*   The image data must also contain specific codes that will cause the `code` variable to increase beyond the size of the table array in the `gif_next_LZW` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GIF image to a system that uses the vulnerable libnsgif library. This could involve a variety of vectors, such as tricking a user into opening a malicious GIF image or sending one to a vulnerable service that processes GIFs.

The content provides a good, detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, including code snippets, example malicious GIF images and gdb debugging output which clearly demonstrates the vulnerability, going beyond the basic description provided by a CVE.
