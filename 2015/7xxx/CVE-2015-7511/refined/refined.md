{
  "CVE-2015-7511": {
    "Description": "Libgcrypt was susceptible to a side-channel attack. A local attacker could use this attack to possibly recover private keys.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Libgcrypt performs elliptic-point curve multiplication during decryption.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Side-channel attack susceptibility due to the way the ECDH decryption algorithm is implemented."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to the recovery of private keys, potentially compromising the security of encrypted data.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack involves measuring electromagnetic emanations from the target device while it performs decryption. This can be done from an adjacent room, using a specialized setup.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be physically proximate to the target device and have specialized equipment to capture and analyze electromagnetic emanations. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the decryption of a specially crafted ciphertext."
