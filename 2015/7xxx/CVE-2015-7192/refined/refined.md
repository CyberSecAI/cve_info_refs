      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of CVE-2015-7192 is an error in how HTML tables are exposed to accessibility tools on OS X. Specifically, it occurs when an accessibility tool requests the index of a table row through the `NSAccessibilityIndexAttribute` value. The incorrect implementation leads to a read access violation.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a read access violation within the accessibility code for HTML tables on macOS. The code attempts to access a child element using an index that could be out of bounds, which occurs when the index of a table row in its parent is greater than number of children of the object",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker who can craft a malicious web page or email can cause a crash of the application on a targeted user's macOS system, if the user is using assistive technologies. This could also lead to possible arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage or email which, when viewed by a user with an active accessibility tool, triggers the flawed code path.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to view the malicious content, either through a web page or email. They do not require a user account on the target system."
