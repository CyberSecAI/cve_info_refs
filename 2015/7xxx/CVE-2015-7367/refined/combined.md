Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
---------------------------------

N B Sri Harsh–∞ has discovered that some plugin actions (e.g. enabling,
disabling) could be performed via GET without any CSRF protection mechanism.
Succesful CSRF attacks could potentially lead to service disruptions in case
some core plugins are disabled. He also discovered that the account-user-*.php
scripts were not actuallly checking the CSRF token sent via POST, allowing
minor attacks, such as changing the victim's contact name and language.

CWE: CWE-532
CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2015-001

## Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2015-001

* Advisory ID: [REVIVE-SA-2015-001](https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2015-001/)
* CVE-IDs: CVE-2015-7364, CVE-2015-7365, CVE-2015-7366, CVE-2015-7367, CVE-2015-7368, CVE-2015-7369, CVE-2015-7370, CVE-2015-7371, CVE-2015-7372, CVE-2015-7373
* Date: 2015-10-07
* Risk Level: Medium
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 3.2.1
* Versions not affected: >= 3.2.2
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 ‚Äì Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7364
* CWE-ID: CWE-352
* CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### Description

Abdullah Hussam Gazi discovered that the CSRF protection mechanism introduced a few years ago to secure the forms generated with the HTML\_Quickform library (most of the forms in Revive Adserver‚Äôs admin UI) could be easily bypassed by sending an empty token along with the POST data. The range of malicious actions includes, but is not limited to, modifying entities like banners and zones and altering preferences and settings.

## Vulnerability 2 ‚Äì Reflected XSS

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7365
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Abdullah Hussam Gazi has discovered that the plugin upgrade form was not properly escaping filenames before displaying them when uploading a file containing errors. Exploiting the vulnerability required a specifically crafted multipart POST message.

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7365
* http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html

## Vulnerability 3 ‚Äì Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7366
* CWE-ID: CWE-532
* CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### Description

N B Sri Harsha has discovered that some plugin actions (e.g. enabling, disabling) could be performed via GET without any CSRF protection mechanism. Successful CSRF attacks could potentially lead to service disruptions in the case of core plugins being disabled. He also discovered that the account-user-\*.php scripts were not checking the CSRF token sent via POST, allowing minor attacks, such as changing the victim‚Äôs contact name and language.

## Vulnerability 4 ‚Äì Improper Access Control

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7367
* CWE-ID: CWE-284
* CVSSv2: 4.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### Description

N B Sri Harsha discovered that deleting or unlinking users with an active session didn‚Äôt have any effect until the session was expired, potentially allowing the users to perform undesired actions while such sessions were still active.

* http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7367
* http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html

## Vulnerability 5 ‚Äì Information Exposure Through Browser Caching

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7368
* CWE-ID: CWE-525
* CVSSv2: 2.1 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

### Description

N B Sri Harsha has discovered that the cached copies of pages visited in Revive Adserver‚Äôs admin UI were still reachable via the browser history after successfully logging out. This potentially allowed expose of sensitive information to unauthorised parties.

* https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/c76f675d

## Vulnerability 6 ‚Äì Overly Permissive Cross-domain Whitelist

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7369
* CWE-ID: CWE-942
* CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### Description

Sergey Markov has reported that the crossdomain.xml files shipped with Revive Adserver are overly permissive. On a default installation they could in fact be exploited with malicious intents, e.g. to steal session cookies.

## Vulnerability 7 ‚Äì Reflected XSS

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7370
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Sergey Markov has discovered that the open-flash-chart.swf file, used by the VideoAds plugin in Revive Adserver, was vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks on the id and data-file parameters. This file was included via the third party LGPLv2 graphing library, Open Flash Chart 2, which appears to be currently unmaintained. The Revive Adserver team has therefore decided to fix the vulnerabilities that had been reported and to publish a github repository for the library, containing its history and the vulnerability fixes, for the benefit of everyone else using it: https://github.com/revive-adserver/open-flash-chart

* https://github.com/revive-adserver/open-flash-chart/commit/0a181c56

## Vulnerability 8 ‚Äì Improper Access Control

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7371
* CWE-ID: CWE-284
* CVSSv2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

### Description

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that run-mpe.php, a script used by the admin UI to asynchronously trigger a run of the Maintenance Priority Engine when necessary, was lacking proper authentication and access control and could therefore be called by any third party. Running maintenance is a resource intensive task, although a locking mechanism prevents it from being run multiple times concurrently; thus, run-mpe.php cannot be used alone for a resource exhaustion attack.

* http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html

## Vulnerability 9 ‚Äì Local File Inclusion

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7372
* CWE-ID: CWE-98
* CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

### Description

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that the layerstyle parameter in al.php was not properly sanitized, causing a potential LFI vulnerability. Under normal circumstances, an attacker would need to place a file named layerstyle.inc.php in an arbitrary directory on the server and craft the layerstyle parameter accordingly to load it. If an old version of PHP is being used the server, other attack techniques might be possible, e.g. NULL-byte truncation.

* https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/c76f675d

## Vulnerability 10 ‚Äì Reflected XSS (Cross-site scripting)

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7373
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

### Description

A feature called ‚Äúmagic-macros‚Äù in Revive Adserver allows dynamic data to be displayed in the banner output. There is a predefined set of such macros (e.g. {random}, {clickurl}, etc.), but the feature also allows the display of arbitrary GET parameters. A user reported that the values coming from GET parameters were not properly escaped before being displayed, thus making banners using such magic-macros a potential vector for XSS attacks.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7364
CWE-ID: CWE-352
CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
========================================================================

Abdullah Hussam Gazi discovered that the CSRF protection mechanism
introduced a few years ago to secure the forms generated with the
HTML_Quickform library (most of the forms in Revive Adserver's admin
UI) could be easily bypassed by sending an empty token along with the
POST data. The range of malicious actions includes, but is not limited
to, modifying entities like banners and zones and altering preferences
and settings.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 2 - Reflected XSS
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7365
CWE-ID: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
========================================================================

Abdullah Hussam Gazi has discovered that the plugin upgrade form was
not properly escaping filenames before displaying them when uploading
a file containing errors. Exploiting the vulnerability required a
specifically crafted multipart POST message.

Vulnerability 3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7366
CWE-ID: CWE-532
CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
========================================================================

N B Sri Harsha has discovered that some plugin actions (e.g. enabling,
disabling) could be performed via GET without any CSRF protection
mechanism. Successful CSRF attacks could potentially lead to service
disruptions in the case of core plugins being disabled. He also
discovered that the account-user-*.php scripts were not checking the
CSRF token sent via POST, allowing minor attacks, such as changing the
victim's contact name and language.

Vulnerability 4 - Improper Access Control
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7367
CWE-ID: CWE-284
CVSSv2: 4.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
========================================================================

N B Sri Harsha discovered that deleting or unlinking users with an
active session didn't have any effect until the session was expired,
potentially allowing the users to perform undesired actions while such
sessions were still active.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 5 - Information Exposure Through Browser Caching
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7368
CWE-ID: CWE-525
CVSSv2: 2.1 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
========================================================================

N B Sri Harsha has discovered that the cached copies of pages visited
in Revive Adserver's admin UI were still reachable via the browser
history after successfully logging out. This potentially allowed
exposuse of sensitive information to unauthorised parties.

Vulnerability 6 - Overly Permissive Cross-domain Whitelist
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7369
CWE-ID: CWE-942
CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
========================================================================

Sergey Markov has reported that the crossdomain.xml files shipped with
Revive Adserver are overly permissive. On a default installation they
could in fact be exploited with malicious intents, e.g. to steal
session cookies.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 7 - Reflected XSS
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7370
CWE-ID: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
========================================================================

Sergey Markov has discovered that the open-flash-chart.swf file, used
by the VideoAds plugin in Revive Adserver, was vulnerable to reflected
XSS attacks on the id and data-file parameters. This file was included
via the third party LGPLv2 graphing library, Open Flash Chart 2, which
appears to be currently unmaintained. The Revive Adserver team has
therefore decided to fix the vulnerabilities that had been reported
and to publish a github repository for the library, containing its
history and the vulnerability fixes, for the benefit of everyone else
using it:

<https://github.com/revive-adserver/open-flash-chart>

========================================================================
Vulnerability 8 - Improper Access Control
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7371
CWE-ID: CWE-284
CVSSv2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
========================================================================

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that run-mpe.php, a script used by
the admin UI to asynchronously trigger a run of the Maintenance
Priority Engine when necessary, was lacking proper authentication and
access control and could therefore be called by any third party.
Running maintenance is a resource intensive task, although a locking
mechanism prevents it from being run multiple times concurrently;
thus, run-mpe.php cannot be used alone for a resource exhaustion attack.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 9 - Local File Inclusion
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7372
CWE-ID: CWE-98
CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
========================================================================

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that the layerstyle parameter in
al.php was not properly sanitized, causing a potential LFI
vulnerability. Under normal circumstances, an attacker would need to
place a file named layerstyle.inc.php in an arbitrary directory on the
server and craft the layerstyle parameter accordingly to load it. If
an old version of PHP is being used the server, other attack
techniques might be possible, e.g. NULL-byte truncation.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 10 - Reflected XSS (Cross-site scripting)
========================================================================
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7373
CWE-ID: CWE-79
CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
========================================================================

A feature called "magic-macros" in Revive Adserver allows dynamic data
to be displayed in the banner output. There is a predefined set of
such macros (e.g. {random}, {clickurl}, etc.), but the feature also
allows the display of arbitrary GET parameters. A user reported that
the values coming from GET parameters were not properly escaped before
being displayed, thus making banners using such magic-macros a
potential vector for XSS attacks.

Successful CSRF attacks could potentially lead to service disruptions in the case of core plugins being disabled. He also discovered that the account-user-\*.php scripts were not checking the CSRF token sent via POST, allowing minor attacks, such as changing the victim‚Äôs contact name and language.

## Vulnerability 5 ‚Äì Information Exposure Through Browser Caching

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7368
* CWE-ID: CWE-525
* CVSSv2: 2.1 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

### Description

N B Sri Harsha has discovered that the cached copies of pages visited in Revive Adserver‚Äôs admin UI were still reachable via the browser history after successfully logging out. This potentially allowed expose of sensitive information to unauthorised parties.

## Vulnerability 6 ‚Äì Overly Permissive Cross-domain Whitelist

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7369
* CWE-ID: CWE-942
* CVSSv2: 5.1 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

### Description

Sergey Markov has reported that the crossdomain.xml files shipped with Revive Adserver are overly permissive. On a default installation they could in fact be exploited with malicious intents, e.g. to steal session cookies.

## Vulnerability 7 ‚Äì Reflected XSS

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7370
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

### Description

Sergey Markov has discovered that the open-flash-chart.swf file, used by the VideoAds plugin in Revive Adserver, was vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks on the id and data-file parameters. This file was included via the third party LGPLv2 graphing library, Open Flash Chart 2, which appears to be currently unmaintained. The Revive Adserver team has therefore decided to fix the vulnerabilities that had been reported and to publish a github repository for the library, containing its history and the vulnerability fixes, for the benefit of everyone else using it: https://github.com/revive-adserver/open-flash-chart

## Vulnerability 8 ‚Äì Improper Access Control

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7371
* CWE-ID: CWE-284
* CVSSv2: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

### Description

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that run-mpe.php, a script used by the admin UI to asynchronously trigger a run of the Maintenance Priority Engine when necessary, was lacking proper authentication and access control and could therefore be called by any third party. Running maintenance is a resource intensive task, although a locking mechanism prevents it from being run multiple times concurrently; thus, run-mpe.php cannot be used alone for a resource exhaustion attack.

## Vulnerability 9 ‚Äì Local File Inclusion

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7372
* CWE-ID: CWE-98
* CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

### Description

Krzysztof K. Wasielewski reported that the layerstyle parameter in al.php was not properly sanitized, causing a potential LFI vulnerability. Under normal circumstances, an attacker would need to place a file named layerstyle.inc.php in an arbitrary directory on the server and craft the layerstyle parameter accordingly to load it. If an old version of PHP is being used the server, other attack techniques might be possible, e.g. NULL-byte truncation.

## Vulnerability 10 ‚Äì Reflected XSS (Cross-site scripting)

* CVE-ID: CVE-2015-7373
* CWE-ID: CWE-79
* CVSSv2: 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

### Description

A feature called ‚Äúmagic-macros‚Äù in Revive Adserver allows dynamic data to be displayed in the banner output. There is a predefined set of such macros (e.g. {random}, {clickurl}, etc.), but the feature also allows the display of arbitrary GET parameters. A user reported that the values coming from GET parameters were not properly escaped before being displayed, thus making banners using such magic-macros a potential vector for XSS attacks.
