{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that deleting or unlinking users with active sessions doesn't invalidate those sessions immediately. Instead, the user remains logged in with an active session until it expires.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
    ],
    "impact": "Users can continue to perform actions after being deleted/unlinked, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the administrative interface. An attacker would need to have admin access to delete or unlink a user.",
    "required_capabilities": "Requires an attacker with administrative access to the application."
  },
  "additional_notes": "This commit fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that when a user is deleted or unlinked, their session is immediately invalidated."
