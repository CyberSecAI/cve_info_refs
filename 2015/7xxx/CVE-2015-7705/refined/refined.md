Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The rate limiting feature in NTP versions before 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.x before 4.3.77 is vulnerable to improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper input validation in the rate limiting feature

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering rate limiting on an NTP server
    * An attacker can send a large number of crafted requests to an NTP server. This triggers the server's rate limiting, causing it to reject subsequent legitimate client requests, potentially disrupting time synchronization.
*   Unspecified impact due to a large number of crafted requests.
*   An attacker can also send packets claiming to be from a target, triggering a KoD (Kiss of Death) response from a server implementing KoD rate limiting. This causes the target to delay or stop querying servers. It could also lead to firewall blocks.
*   A client that receives a KoD message may delay or stop querying its servers, disrupting time synchronization.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote network attack
    *   Attackers can be anywhere on the network.
    *   Attackers can spoof packets.
    *   Attackers need to know what NTP servers the target is communicating with. This information is often publicly available through sending a time query to the target.
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to send network packets to the target NTP server
*   Network access and ability to perform off-path or MITM attacks
*   Knowledge of the target's NTP server configuration
*   For certain scenarios, a low-privileged attacker with network access may suffice.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an improper input validation issue, where the rate-limiting feature is not robust enough to handle a large number of crafted requests.
*   The attacker can learn what servers a client communicates with by sending the client a time query
*   The vulnerability can lead to an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
*   The vulnerability can also cause a denial of service due to a client-server association tear down when an invalid authentication is sent to a broadcast client
