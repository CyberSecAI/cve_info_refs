#### 3.2.13    [IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION CWE-287](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html)

ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (ephemeralassociation demobilization) by sending a spoofed crypto-NAK packet with incorrect authentication data at a certain time.

[CVE-2016-4953](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4953) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.14    [CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION')CWE-362](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)

The process\_packet function in ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (peer-variable modification) by sending spoofed packets from many source IP addresses in a certain scenario, as demonstrated by triggering an incorrect leap indication.

[CVE-2016-4954](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4954) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to the Port UDP/123 of an affected device.
* Migrate to a successor product.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-497656](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-497656.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

***The Security of the Network Time Protocol***

**Boston University**

Time is a fundamental building block for computing applications, and is heavily utilized by many cryptographic protocols (eg. [digital certificates and TLS](https://www.thawte.com/resources/getting-started/ssl-faq/%22),
[bitcoin](http://culubas.blogspot.com/2011/05/timejacking-bitcoin_802.html),
[authentication with Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29), [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions), etc). Time on computer clocks is commonly set using the Network Time Protocol ([NTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5905.txt)). This project considers the security of NTP, and its [specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905), and its reference implementation [ntpd](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). We consider various threats to NTP that allow an attacker to either (a) alter time on computer systems that set their clocks using NTP (timeshifting attacks), or (b) prevent those systems from synchronizing their clocks (denial of service attacks). We are also designing protocols that can secure NTP against these attacks.

## NTP.org ntpd contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#718152

Original Release Date: 2016-04-27 | Last Revised: 2016-04-28

---

### Overview

The NTP.org reference implementation of ntpd contains multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| NTP.org's reference implementation of NTP server, ntpd, contains multiple vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay -** CVE-2015-7973An attacker on the network can record and replay authenticated broadcast mode packets. Also known as the "Deja Vu" attack.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7974A missing key check allows impersonation between authenticated peers. Also known as the "Skeleton Key" attack.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7975The nextvar() function does not properly validate length.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7976ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in filenames[**CWE-476**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**: NULL Pointer Dereference -** CVE-2015-7977reslist NULL pointer dereference[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2015-7978Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction list[**CWE-821**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/821.html)**: Incorrect Synchronization -** CVE-2015-7979Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast and other pre-emptable modes[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-8138Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass[**CWE-200**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure -** CVE-2015-8139Network Time Protocol ntpq and ntpdc Origin Timestamp Disclosure Vulnerability<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2946>[**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay -** CVE-2015-8140Network Time Protocol ntpq Control Protocol Replay Vulnerability<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2947>[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2015-8158Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2948>[**CWE-821**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/821.html)**: Incorrect Synchronization -** CVE-2016-1547An off-path attacker can deny service to ntpd clients by demobilizing preemptable associations using spoofed crypto-NAK packets. This vulnerability involves different code paths than those used by CVE-2015-7979.[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2016-1548By spoofing packets from a legitimate server, an attacker can change the time of an ntpd client or deny service to an ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode.[**CWE-362**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)**: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') -** CVE-2016-1549ntpd does not prevent Sybil attacks from authenticated peers. An malicious authenticated peer can create any number of ephemeral associations in order to win ntpd's clock selection algorithm and modify a victim's clock.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-1550ntpd does not use a constant-time memory comparison function when validating the authentication digest on incoming packets. In some situations this may allow an attacker to conduct a timing attack to compute the value of the valid authentication digest causing forged packets to be accepted by ntpd.[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2016-1551ntpd does not filter IPv4 bogon packets received from the network. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to spoof refclock packets to ntpd processes on systems that do not implement bogon filtering.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-2516, CVE-2016-2517Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will cause an assertion botch in ntpd. A regression caused by the patch for CVE-2016-2516 was fixed and identified as CVE-2016-2517.[**CWE-125**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)**: Out-of-bounds Read -** CVE-2016-2518Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode > 7 causes the MATCH\_ASSOC() lookup to make an out-of-bounds reference.[**CWE-119**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer -** CVE-2016-2519ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information in ntpd. It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl\_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl\_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl\_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is "too large", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7704**,** CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's [April 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security) as well as the [January 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit). |

### Impact

| Unauthenticated remote attackers may be able to spoof packets to cause denial of service, authentication bypass on commands, or certain configuration changes. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's [April 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security) as well as the [January 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Partial patches for some of these issues were initially released in January 2016 as version 4.2.8p6. Complete patches for all of these issues are now available in version [4.2.8p7](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html), released 2016-04-26. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. |

An update that solves 28 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
ntp was updated to version 4.2.8p6 to fix 28 security issues.
Major functional changes:
- The "sntp" commandline tool changed its option handling in a major way,
some options have been renamed or dropped.
- "controlkey 1" is added during update to ntp.conf to allow sntp to work.
- The local clock is being disabled during update.
- ntpd is no longer running chrooted.
Other functional changes:
- ntp-signd is installed.
- "enable mode7" can be added to the configuration to allow ntdpc to work
as compatibility mode option.
- "kod" was removed from the default restrictions.
- SHA1 keys are used by default instead of MD5 keys.
Also yast2-ntp-client was updated to match some sntp syntax changes.
(bsc#937837)
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).

the origin timestamp field (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data
packet length checks (bsc#951608).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
- Add a controlkey line to /etc/ntp.conf if one does not already exist to
allow runtime configuuration via ntpq.
- bsc#946386: Temporarily disable memlock to avoid problems due to high
memory usage during name resolution.
- bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- Fix legacy action scripts to pass on command line arguments.
- bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
- bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
- Add a controlkey to ntp.conf to make the above work.
- Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
- Disable mode 7 (ntpdc) again, now that we don't use it anymore.
- Add "addserver" as a new legacy action.
- bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
- bsc#926510: Disable chroot by default.
- bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to Port UDP/123 of an affected device.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for industrial security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and follow the recommendations in the product manual.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information about this issue, please see Siemens security advisory [SSA-211752](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-211752.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

An update that solves 30 vulnerabilities and has 6 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This network time protocol server ntp was updated to 4.2.8p6 to fix the
following issues:
Also yast2-ntp-client was updated to match some sntp syntax changes.
(bsc#937837)
Major functional changes:
- The "sntp" commandline tool changed its option handling in a major way.
- "controlkey 1" is added during update to ntp.conf to allow sntp to work.
- The local clock is being disabled during update.
- ntpd is no longer running chrooted.
Other functional changes:
- ntp-signd is installed.
- "enable mode7" can be added to the configuration to allow ntdpc to work
as compatibility mode option.
- "kod" was removed from the default restrictions.
- SHA1 keys are used by default instead of MD5 keys.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-5219: An endless loop due to incorrect precision to double
conversion (bsc#943216).
- CVE-2015-8158: Fixed potential infinite loop in ntpq (bsc#962966).
- CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (bsc#963002).
- CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated
broadcast mode (bsc#962784).
- CVE-2015-7978: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction
list (bsc#963000).
- CVE-2015-7977: reslist NULL pointer dereference (bsc#962970).
- CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in
filenames (bsc#962802).
- CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
- CVE-2015-7974: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation
between authenticated peers (bsc#962960).
- CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
- CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks (bsc#962994).
- CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin (bsc#962997).
- CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker could have forced ntpd to make a step
larger than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
- CVE-2015-7871: NAK to the Future: Symmetric association authentication
bypass via crypto-NAK (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7855: decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning
FAIL on some bogus values (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7854: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7853: Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock driver
could cause a buffer overflow (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7852: ntpq atoascii() Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7851: saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7850: remote config logfile-keyfile (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7849: trusted key use-after-free (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7848: mode 7 loop counter underrun (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7701: Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7703: configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile" should
only be allowed locally (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705: Clients that receive a KoD should validate
the origin timestamp field (bsc#951608).
- CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data
packet length checks (bsc#951608).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- fate#320758 bsc#975981: Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP
(--enable-ntp-signd). This replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added
the authreg directive.
- bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which
caused the synchronization to fail.
- bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
- bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
- bsc#956773: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen
quite a lot on loaded systems.
- bsc#951559,bsc#975496: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
- Add a controlkey line to /etc/ntp.conf if one does not already exist to
allow runtime configuuration via ntpq.
- bsc#946386: Temporarily disable memlock to avoid problems due to high
memory usage during name resolution.
- bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- Fix legacy action scripts to pass on command line arguments.
- bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
- bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
- Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
- Disable mode 7 (ntpdc) again, now that we don't use it anymore.
- Add "addserver" as a new legacy action.
- bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
- bsc#926510: Disable chroot by default.
- bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.
- bsc#784760: Remove local clock from default configuration.
- bsc#942441/fate#319496: Require perl-Socket6.
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- bsc#920183: Allow -4 and -6 address qualifiers in "server" directives.
- Use upstream ntp-wait, because our version is incompatible with the new
ntpq command line syntax.

# NTP BUG 2901: Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field

Last update: April 22, 2024 18:49 UTC ([7e7bd5857](https://git.nwtime.org/websites/ntpwww/commit/7e7bd5857f893277639b3765bf9347c4c6faa447))

#### Summary

| **Resolved** | [4.2.8p4](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8p4-release-announcement/) | 21 Oct 2015 |

| **References** | [Bug 2901](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2901) | [CVE-2015-7704](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-7704) [CVE-2015-7705](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-7705) |
| **Affects** | All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77. | Resolved in 4.2.8p4. |
| **CVSS2 Score** | 4.3-5.0 at worst | [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator?calculator&version=2.0&vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)) |

#### Description

An `ntpd` client that honors Kiss-of-Death responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target’s time source by sending the target a time query.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you cannot upgrade, restrict who can query `ntpd` to learn who its servers are, and what IPs are allowed to ask your system for the time. This mitigation is heavy-handed.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

> **NOTE:** 4.2.8p4 protects against the first attack. For the second attack, all we can do is warn when it is happening, which we do in 4.2.8p4.

#### Credit

This weakness was discovered by Aanchal Malhotra, Issac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg of Boston University.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1274184#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 08:16:59 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way NTP handled rate limiting. An attacker able to send a large number of crafted requests to an NTP server could trigger the rate limiting on that server, and prevent clients from getting a usable reply from the server.  The default NTP configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not enable rate limiting.  External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1274184#c4)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-06 13:57:24 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1296166](show_bug.cgi?id=1296166 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2015-7705 ntp: denial of service by trigerring rate limiting on NTP server [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1274184#c6)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-07 13:32:23 UTC  ``` While mitigating this particular issue by adding a log message into the log files, the upstream fix may have inadvertently introduced a new issue that could fill up all log files.  The correct fix for this issue is randomized response rate limiting. However, implementing this issue would radically change the way limiting works in NTP and could potentially break other application's functionality relying on this feature currently.  An additional, less intrusive fix for this issue may be developed at a later time and included in later releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  Rate limiting is by default disabled in the ntp packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. To specifically disable rate limiting, use the following workaround.  Mitigation:  Do not add the "limited" configuration option to any restrict lines in the ntp.conf file.   ``` |  |

In products that allow editing the *ntp.conf* file, this is accomplished by the *notrust* directive and configuring peer authentication. Other products may support **ntp access-group** commands that can be used to filter NTP queries to trusted hosts only. Potential workarounds for each affected Cisco product are referenced in the Cisco Bug ID workarounds section.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

## Details

Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain remote

config packets. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated

attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in

a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5146](/security/CVE-2015-5146))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logconfig

directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5194](/security/CVE-2015-5194))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain statistics

types. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-5195](/security/CVE-2015-5195))

# CVE-2016-1548

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2016-1547.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2016-1549.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-1548 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1548)

#### Description

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched.

V1.0

SUMMARY

There are multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying NTP component of the affected TIM 4R-IE.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

TIM 4R-IE (incl. SIPLUS NET variants):
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

TIM 4R-IE DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants):
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time syncronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default.

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to the port udp/123 of an affected device.

• Migrate to a successor product.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The TIM 4R-IE is a SINAUT ST7 communications module for the SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface
for SINAUT communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for SINAUT communication via an
IP-based network (WAN or LAN).

The TIM 4R-IE DNP3 communication module for SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface for DNP3
communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for DNP3 communication via a IP-based network
(WAN or LAN).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

This release also contained improved patches for CVE-2015-7704,
CVE-2015-7705, CVE-2015-7974.
These non-security issues were fixed:
- bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker process to
avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
- bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().
- bsc#979981: ntp-wait does not accept fractional seconds, so use 1
instead of 0.2 in ntp-wait.service.
- Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".
- bsc#957226: Restrict the parser in the startup script to the first
occurrance of "keys" and "controlkey" in ntp.conf.

An update that fixes 37 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for ntp fixes the following issues:
- Update to 4.2.8p7 (boo#977446):
\* CVE-2016-1547, boo#977459: Validate crypto-NAKs, AKA: CRYPTO-NAK DoS.
\* CVE-2016-1548, boo#977461: Interleave-pivot
\* CVE-2016-1549, boo#977451: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association
attack.
\* CVE-2016-1550, boo#977464: Improve NTP security against buffer
comparison timing attacks.
\* CVE-2016-1551, boo#977450: Refclock impersonation vulnerability
\* CVE-2016-2516, boo#977452: Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will
cause an assertion botch in ntpd.
\* CVE-2016-2517, boo#977455: remote configuration trustedkey/
requestkey/controlkey values are not properly validated.
\* CVE-2016-2518, boo#977457: Crafted addpeer with hmode > 7 causes array
wraparound with MATCH\_ASSOC.
\* CVE-2016-2519, boo#977458: ctl\_getitem() return value not always
checked.
\* integrate ntp-fork.patch
\* Improve the fixes for: CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705, CVE-2015-7974
- Restrict the parser in the startup script to the first
occurrance of "keys" and "controlkey" in ntp.conf (boo#957226).
- Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP (--enable-ntp-signd). This
replaces the w32 patches in 4.2.4 that added the authreg directive.
(fate#320758).
- Fix ntp-sntp-dst.patch (boo#975496).
- Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in start-ntpd. When
run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path, which caused the
synchronization to fail. (boo#962318)
- Speedup ntpq (boo#782060, ntp-speedup-ntpq.patch).
- Sync service files with openSUSE Factory.
- Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST (boo#951559).
- Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
- Update to 4.2.8p6:
\* CVE-2015-8158, boo#962966: Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq.
\* CVE-2015-8138, boo#963002: origin: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass.
\* CVE-2015-7979, boo#962784: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on
authenticated broadcast mode.
\* CVE-2015-7978, boo#963000: Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of
restriction list.
\* CVE-2015-7977, boo#962970: reslist NULL pointer dereference.
\* CVE-2015-7976, boo#962802: ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous
characters in filenames.
\* CVE-2015-7975, boo#962988: nextvar() missing length check.
\* CVE-2015-7974, boo#962960: Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows
impersonation between authenticated peers.
\* CVE-2015-7973, boo#962995: Deja Vu: Replay attack on authenticated
broadcast mode.
\* CVE-2015-8140: ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks.
\* CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin.
\* CVE-2015-5300, boo#951629: Small-step/Big-step.
- Add /var/db/ntp-kod (boo#916617).
- Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might happen quite a lot
on loaded systems (boo#956773).
- add ntp.bug2965.diff (boo#954982)
\* fixes regression in 4.2.8p4 update
- Update to 4.2.8p4 to fix several security issues (boo#951608):
\* CVE-2015-7871: NAK to the Future: Symmetric association authentication
bypass via crypto-NAK
\* CVE-2015-7855: decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning
FAIL on some bogus values
\* CVE-2015-7854: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability
\* CVE-2015-7853: Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock
driver could cause a buffer overflow
\* CVE-2015-7852 ntpq atoascii() Memory Corruption Vulnerability
\* CVE-2015-7851 saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability
\* CVE-2015-7850 remote config logfile-keyfile
\* CVE-2015-7849 trusted key use-after-free
\* CVE-2015-7848 mode 7 loop counter underrun
\* CVE-2015-7701 Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC
\* CVE-2015-7703 configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile"
should only be allowed locally
\* CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705 Clients that receive a KoD should
validate the origin timestamp field
\* CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702 Incomplete autokey data
packet length checks
\* obsoletes ntp-memlock.patch.
- Add a controlkey line to /etc/ntp.conf if one does not already exist to
allow runtime configuuration via ntpq.
- Temporarily disable memlock to avoid problems due to high memory usage
during name resolution (boo#946386, ntp-memlock.patch).
- Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys (boo#905885).
- Improve runtime configuration:
\* Read keytype from ntp.conf
\* Don't write ntp keys to syslog.
- Fix legacy action scripts to pass on command line arguments.
- Remove ntp.1.gz, it wasn't installed anymore.
- Remove ntp-4.2.7-rh-manpages.tar.gz and only keep ntptime.8.gz. The rest
is partially irrelevant, partially redundant and potentially outdated
(boo#942587).
- Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf (boo#944300).
- Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd (boo#936327).
- Add a controlkey to ntp.conf to make the above work.
- Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
- Disable mode 7 (ntpdc) again, now that we don't use it anymore.
- Add "addserver" as a new legacy action.
- Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf (boo#910063).
- Update to version 4.2.8p3 which incorporates all security fixes and most
other patches we have so far (fate#319040). More information on:
<http://archive.ntp.org/ntp4/ChangeLog-stable>
- Disable chroot by default (boo#926510).
- Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility (boo#920238).
- Security fix: ntp-keygen may generate non-random symmetric keys

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:34:45 UTC  ``` It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:  -g   Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the thresh‐ old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for other options.  ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by attackers to expire certificates, etc.  This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082271](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=diff "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=edit "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [CVE-2015-5300](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5300) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:39:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:40:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274166](show_bug.cgi?id=1274166 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2015-5300 ntp: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger than the panic threshold [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

\* CVE-2015-7976: ntpq saveconfig command allowed dangerous characters
in filenames (bsc#962802).
\* CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (bsc#962988).
\* CVE-2015-7974: NTP did not verify peer associations of symmetric
keys when authenticating packets, which might have allowed remote
attackers to conduct impersonation attacks via an arbitrary trusted
key, aka a "skeleton" key (bsc#962960).
\* CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
(bsc#962995).
\* CVE-2015-5300: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger
than the panic threshold (bsc#951629).
\* CVE-2015-5194: Crash with crafted logconfig configuration command

\* CVE-2015-7855: decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning
FAIL on some bogus values (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7854: Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7853: Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock
driver could cause a buffer overflow (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7852: ntpq atoascii() Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7851: saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7850: Clients that receive a KoD now validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7849: Prevent use-after-free trusted key (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7848: Prevent mode 7 loop counter underrun (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7701: Slow memory leak in CRYPTO\_ASSOC (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7703: Configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile"
should only be allowed locally (bsc#943221).
\* CVE-2015-7704: Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7705: Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin
timestamp field (bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7691: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7692: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-7702: Incomplete autokey data packet length checks
(bsc#952611).
\* CVE-2015-1798: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP required a correct MAC only if the MAC
field has a nonzero length, which made it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof packets by omitting the MAC
(bsc#924202).
\* CVE-2015-1799: The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
ntp\_proto.c in ntpd in NTP performed state-variable updates upon
receiving certain invalid packets, which made it easier for
man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service
(synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer
(bsc#924202).
These non-security issues were fixed:
\* Keep the parent process alive until the daemon has finished
initialisation, to make sure that the PID file exists when the
parent returns.
\* bsc#979302: Change the process name of the forking DNS worker
process to avoid the impression that ntpd is started twice.
\* bsc#981422: Don't ignore SIGCHILD because it breaks wait().
\* Separate the creation of ntp.keys and key #1 in it to avoid problems
when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1,
which is needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".
\* bsc#957226: Restrict the parser in the startup script to the first
occurrance of "keys" and "controlkey" in ntp.conf.
\* Enable compile-time support for MS-SNTP (--enable-ntp-signd)
\* bsc#975496: Fix ntp-sntp-dst.patch.
\* bsc#962318: Call /usr/sbin/sntp with full path to synchronize in
start-ntpd. When run as cron job, /usr/sbin/ is not in the path,
which caused the synchronization to fail.
\* bsc#782060: Speedup ntpq.
\* bsc#951559: Fix the TZ offset output of sntp during DST.
\* bsc#916617: Add /var/db/ntp-kod.
\* bsc#951351: Add ntp-ENOBUFS.patch to limit a warning that might
happen quite a lot on loaded systems.
\* Add ntp-fork.patch and build with threads disabled to allow name
resolution even when running chrooted.
\* bnc#784760: Remove local clock from default configuration.
\* Fix incomplete backporting of "rcntp ntptimemset".
\* bsc#936327: Use ntpq instead of deprecated ntpdc in start-ntpd.
\* Don't let "keysdir" lines in ntp.conf trigger the "keys" parser.
\* bsc#910063: Fix the comment regarding addserver in ntp.conf.
\* bsc#944300: Remove "kod" from the restrict line in ntp.conf.
\* bsc#905885: Use SHA1 instead of MD5 for symmetric keys.
\* bsc#926510: Re-add chroot support, but mark it as deprecated and
disable it by default.
\* bsc#920895: Drop support for running chrooted, because it is an
ongoing source of problems and not really needed anymore, given that
ntp now drops privileges and runs under apparmor.
\* bsc#920183: Allow -4 and -6 address qualifiers in "server"
directives.
\* Use upstream ntp-wait, because our version is incompatible with the
new ntpq command line syntax.
\* bsc#920905: Adjust Util.pm to the Perl version on SLE11.
\* bsc#920238: Enable ntpdc for backwards compatibility.
\* bsc#920893: Don't use %exclude.
\* bsc#988417: Default to NTPD\_FORCE\_SYNC\_ON\_STARTUP="yes"
\* bsc#988565: Ignore errors when removing extra files during
uninstallation
\* bsc#988558: Don't blindly guess the value to use for IP\_TOS

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c0)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-24 20:20:28 UTC  ``` 4.2.6p5 and 4.2.8p2/3 clients have been observed to honor any received KoD with the source address of a sys.peer, even when the packet contains an origin timestamp that does not match the one in the client's chime request. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:47:47 UTC  ``` No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c2)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:49:22 UTC  ``` I also don't think this is a security issue. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c3)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-26 00:22:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)) > No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps > are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem > it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing?  The observations aren't mine, but the problem is that the implementation is honoring, in client mode, KoDs it receives even if they don't match the chime request.  Validating that the KoD matches the original request helps to mitigate a possible attack where an attacker spoofs KoDs from a clients upstream servers, and by walking the refIDs (at least for v4), successfully denies time service to that client (or worse, steers it towards one hostile upstream server.)  > I also don't think this is a security issue.  Unfortunately in a world where BCP38 compliance is far from universal, it's possible to knock a client offline using only a few spoofed packets.    Validating the origin timestamp returned to us matches the one sent is low cost and would help to up the bar on these sorts of attacks. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2015-08-26 05:10:20 UTC  ``` There are clearly problems with any choice here.  Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from good servers.  I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was similarly authenticated.  There are potential problems no matter what we do here.  There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.  We need to let folks make local policy choices. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c5)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 03:18:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)) > There are clearly problems with any choice here. >  > Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by > sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and > then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from > good servers. >   Well not really. If you are properly set up you get multiple packets from different servers and it's extremely hard for an attacker to do this to all of them. In any case, for DENY or RSTR codes the recipient of a kiss code packet is required to drop the association. For RATE it needs to reduce the frequency of queries.   For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet. The values of the timestamps cannot be used. I've had discussions with Dave Mills on some of this and it is clear that this is the design of the kiss codes. Under NO circumstances can the contents of the packets be used so even if there was a DOS attack these packets could not be used for anything to set the clock.  The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more important and required than possible attack vectors.   > I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is > authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was > similarly authenticated. >   It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.   > There are potential problems no matter what we do here. >  > There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.

Any change would be detrimental to real live and busy systems. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c6)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-28 05:19:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c5)) > Well not really.

It turns out it's not that hard, at least in an IPv4 world where we helpfully place the IP address of the server in the refid field. For v6, provided the server is not publicly listed anywhere the truncated hash protects it to some degree.  For public servers it's not hard to pre-compute a table of hash entries, limiting the number of possible v6 addresses to source an attack from.  > For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet.

This has nothing to do with setting the clock; it has to do with validating that a KoD received actually came from our associated server, and wasn't spoofed.  Since the origin TS comes from the client, using it is not providing time service -- it just gives the client a way to  validate bidirectional communication with the server.  > The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers > (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more > important and required than possible attack vectors.          At this point the biggest worry is going to be selective denial of service attacks by spoofing chimes from a client towards their  associated servers to trigger rate limits, thus knocking them offline.   I have no answer there other than overprovisioning and generous rate  limits.  > It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.          The packet does not need to be dropped; the association needs to be dropped, or at least rate limited, provided that the origin timestamp is  the one the client sent, which helps to validate that it came from the server (or at least an attacker with access to the network path.)          Processing one timestamp out of the packet (which was originally provided by the client to begin with), on the client itself, just to validate the KoD, seems fairly safe.  > The problem raised is more theoretical than real. Any change would be > detrimental to real live and busy systems.          Unfortunately NTF is facing a series of soon-to-be-published attacks around the KoD functionality.  Validating the origin TS on the client may be the only way to save KoD in campus environments (it's probably dead on the wider Internet after this publication.)          Since the origin TS is copied to the transmit and receive TS fields when sending a KoD, this involves no change to the KoD generation code, so it should not affect deployed systems or harm anything in the field.          It just allows us to slightly harden up the clients handling of a received KoD by validating bidirectional communication. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c7)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 20:11:56 UTC  ``` I've received updated information on this and will be reviewing this. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c8)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:36:11 UTC  ``` I have created a repository here ~mayer/ntp-4.2.8-[Bug2901](show_bug.cgi?id=2901 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.") that makes changes to drop any bogus packets. Only if the packet is validated will it check for KoD's and for RATE it will adjust the rate and it will drop all KoD packets. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c9)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:38:07 UTC  ``` Ready for review. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c10)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-06 08:26:18 UTC  ``` BU folks, thanks for the report.  Danny, thanks for your work on this.  STAGED for 4.2.8p4. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-23 06:27:56 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.77 ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c12)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-21 09:25:35 UTC  ``` As discussed on the ntp hackers list couple months ago, this issue doesn't seem to be fully fixed. When the TEST3 check performed on the transmit timestamp fails, the TEST2 check is skipped and a KoD reply is accepted even when its origin timestamp doesn't match the transmit timestamp from the request. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c13)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-21 11:41:27 UTC  ``` Miroslav,  I'm marking this as IN_PROGRESS per your comment.  I don't yet see what you are describing.  In ntp_proto.c, starting at line 1462, we have the case where:  - we are not in interleave mode - if we are not a KOD packet {(in this case we *are*) clear the origin stamp} - else if(aorg is zero, or the org stamps differ) we: - - flash TEST2 - - log a message about unexpected origin timestamps - - see if this qualifies for starting interleave - - RETURN  This case should cover this bug report - a KoD packet is tested for origin timestamp.  Only if the origin timestamps are OK do we get past this point.  - else we clear the origin timestamp  Otherwise, we *are* handling interleave.  We look for a TEST3 violation.  If there isn't a TEST3 violation we do TEST2 checks for interleaved symmetric mode.  I think I may see a case here - the case where we get a KoD response and we're in interleave mode.  Or do you see something else I'm missing?  Now I'm curious about exactly what should happen with KoD packets in interleave mode. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c14)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-22 08:02:59 UTC  ``` In the current stable code on line 1416 in ntp_proto.c is checked the transmit timestamp. When it's zero the code that checks the origin timestamp starting at line 1462 is not executed. A packet that has zero transmit timestamp avoids validation of the origin timestamp. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c15)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 13:56:52 UTC  ``` I've refactored the way KoD packets are checked to include more than just the origin timestamp (the original thrust of this report).  These fixes are STAGED for 4.2.8p7. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c16)  Harlan Stenn    2016-04-27 04:04:20 UTC  ``` Majdi,  Thanks for the report.  Please check 4.2.8p7 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or IN_PROGRESS, as appropriate. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c17)  Ulrich Windl    2016-06-29 10:38:03 UTC  ``` In 4.2.8p8 I got this message (which is not very helpful): 28 Jun 16:04:25 ntpd[17516]: receive: KoD packet from 172.20.16.7 has inconsistent xmt/org/rec timestamps.  Ignoring.  Maybe more details should be added, like in this message: 28 Jun 16:00:04 ntpd[17516]: receive: Unexpected origin timestamp 0xdb1d0120.83568ef6 does not match aorg 0000000000.00000000 from sym_active@172.20.16.3 xmt 0xdb1d0164.82428466 ``` |  |

when upgrading installations that have the file, but no key #1, which is
needed e.g. by "rcntp addserver".
- Update to 4.2.8p7 (bsc#977446):
\* CVE-2016-1547, bsc#977459: Validate crypto-NAKs, AKA: CRYPTO-NAK DoS.
\* CVE-2016-1548, bsc#977461: Interleave-pivot
\* CVE-2016-1549, bsc#977451: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association
attack.
\* CVE-2016-1550, bsc#977464: Improve NTP security against buffer
comparison timing attacks.
\* CVE-2016-1551, bsc#977450: Refclock impersonation vulnerability
\* CVE-2016-2516, bsc#977452: Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will
cause an assertion botch in ntpd.
\* CVE-2016-2517, bsc#977455: remote configuration trustedkey/
requestkey/controlkey values are not properly validated.
\* CVE-2016-2518, bsc#977457: Crafted addpeer with hmode > 7 causes array
wraparound with MATCH\_ASSOC.
\* CVE-2016-2519, bsc#977458: ctl\_getitem() return value not always
checked.
\* integrate ntp-fork.patch
\* Improve the fixes for: CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705, CVE-2015-7974
- Restrict the parser in the startup script to the first
occurrance of "keys" and "controlkey" in ntp.conf (bsc#957226).

SUMMARY

All versions of the SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA contain multiple vulnerabilities in the underlying third party
component NTP.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 443-1 OPC UA (6GK7443-1UX00-
0XE0):
All versions

Currently no remediation is planned
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by

default

• Conﬁgure an additional ﬁrewall to prevent communication to port udp/123 of an affected device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

SSA-211752

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
