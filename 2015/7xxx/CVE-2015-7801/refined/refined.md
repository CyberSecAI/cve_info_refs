Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the `optipng` software, specifically version 0.6.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that memory is freed, and then the program attempts to access it again, leading to unpredictable behavior. This is triggered during the processing of malformed PNG images.
- **Double Free**: The vulnerability also causes a double free, where memory that is already released is attempted to be freed again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the `optipng` application, leading to a denial of service. The valgrind output indicates invalid reads and multiple free errors.
- **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources mention a possibility of arbitrary code execution. This is likely due to the nature of use-after-free vulnerabilities that can sometimes be exploited to achieve more severe effects than simple crashes, although the main vector observed is a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted PNG File:** The attack vector is a malformed PNG image file specifically designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when `optipng` processes the malicious PNG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PNG file to the `optipng` application. This might be through a website that processes user-uploaded images using `optipng`, or other direct input channels. No special privileges are required
- **Target user needs to process the crafted file**: The attacker needs to convince the user to process the crafted file using optipng.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Gustavo Grieco.
- The affected version of OptiPNG (0.6.4) is considered unsupported by the upstream developers, but it is included in distributions like Debian and Ubuntu, which prompted the CVE assignment.
- The vulnerability was fixed in subsequent versions of `optipng`.
- A test case that triggers the vulnerability was provided as an attachment in one of the bug reports.
- Red Hat stated that the vulnerability did not affect versions of `optipng` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
