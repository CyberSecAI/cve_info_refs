*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

                 CVE-2016-2195 CVE-2016-2849
Debian Bug     : 817932 822698

Several security vulnerabilities were found in botan1.10, a C++
library which provides support for many common cryptographic
operations, including encryption, authentication, X.509v3 certificates
and CRLs.

CVE-2015-5726
    The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an
    empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain
    any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications
    reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for
    code execution.

CVE-2015-5727
    The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory
    in a length field, even if there was no chance the read request
    would succeed. This might cause the process to run out of memory or
    invoke the OOM killer.

CVE-2015-7827
    Use constant time PKCS #1 unpadding to avoid possible side channel
    attack against RSA decryption

CVE-2016-2194
    Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm.
    The ressol function implementing the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for
    finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due
    to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite
    modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.
    This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the
    OS2ECP function during ECC point decompression.

CVE-2016-2195
    Fix Heap overflow on invalid ECC point.

CVE-2016-2849
    Use constant time modular inverse algorithm to avoid possible
    side channel attack against ECDSA.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.8-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your botan1.10 packages.

## 2024[Â¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

* 2024-07-08 (CVE-2024-34702): Denial of Service Due to Excessive Name Constraints

  Checking name constraints in X.509 certificates is quadratic in the number of
  names and name constraints. An attacker who presented a certificate chain
  which contained a very large number of names in the SubjectAlternativeName,
  signed by a CA certificate which contained a large number of name constraints,
  could cause a denial of service.

  Introduced in 2.0.0, fixed in 2.19.5 and 3.5.0

  Found and reported by Bing Shi.
* 2024-07-08 (CVE-2024-39312): Authorization Error due to Name Constraint Decoding Bug

  A bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions in X.509 certificates meant
  that if the extension included both permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees,
  only the permitted subtree would be checked. If a certificate included a name
  which was permitted by the permitted subtree but also excluded by excluded
  subtree, it would be accepted.

  Introduced in 2.0.0, fixed in 2.19.5 and 3.5.0
* 2024-02-20: Kyber side channel

  The Kyber implementation was vulnerable to the KyberSlash1 and
  KyberSlash2 side channel issues.

  Introduced in 3.0.0, fixed in 3.3.0
* 2024-02-20 (CVE-2024-34703): DoS due to oversized elliptic curve parameters

  When decoding an ASN.1 encoded elliptic curve, Botan would verify the p
  parameter was actually prime, and at least some minimum size. However it
  failed to check if the prime was far too large (for example thousands of
  bits), in which case checking the prime would take a significant amount of
  computation. Now the maximum size of arbitrary elliptic curves when decoding
  from ASN.1 is limited.

  Reported by Bing Shi

  Fixed in 3.3.0 and 2.19.4

## 2022[Â¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

* 2022-11-16 (CVE-2022-43705): Failure to correctly check OCSP responder embedded certificate

  OCSP responses for some end entity are either signed by the issuing CA certificate of
  the PKI, or an OCSP responder certificate that the PKI authorized to sign responses in
  their name. In the latter case, the responder certificate (and its validation path
  certificate) may be embedded into the OCSP response and clients must verify that such
  certificates are indeed authorized by the CA when validating OCSP responses.

  The OCSP implementation failed to verify that an authorized responder certificate
  embedded in an OCSP response is authorized by the issuing CA. As a result, any valid
  signature by an embedded certificate passed the check and was allowed to make claims
  about the revocation status of certificates of any CA.

  Attackers that are in a position to spoof OCSP responses for a client could therefore
  render legitimate certificates of a 3rd party CA as revoked or even use a compromised
  (and actually revoked) certificate by spoofing an OCSP-âOKâ response. E.g. an attacker
  could exploit this to impersonate a legitimate TLS server using a compromised
  certificate of that host and get around the revocation check using OCSP stapling.

  Introduced in 1.11.34, fixed in 2.19.3 and 3.0.0

## 2020[Â¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

* 2020-12-21 (CVE-2021-24115): Codec encoding/decoding was not constant time

  The base64, base32, base58 and hex encoding/decoding routines used lookup
  tables which could leak information via a cache-based side channel attack.
  The encoding tables were small and unlikely to be exploitable, but the
  decoding tables were large enough to cause non-negligible information
  leakage. In particular parsing an unencrypted PEM-encoded private key within
  an SGX enclave could be easily attacked to leak key material.

  Identified and reported by Jan Wichelmann, Thomas Eisenbarth,
  Sebastian Berndt, and Florian Sieck.

  Fixed in 2.17.3
* 2020-07-05: Failure to enforce name constraints on alternative names

  The path validation algorithm enforced name constraints on the primary DN
  included in the certificate but failed to do so against alternative DNs which
  may be included in the subject alternative name. This would allow a corrupted
  sub-CA which was constrained by a name constraints extension in its own
  certificate to issue a certificate containing a prohibited DN. Until 2.15.0,
  there was no API to access these alternative name DNs so it is unlikely that
  any application would make incorrect access control decisions on the basis of
  the incorrect DN. Reported by Mario Korth of Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum.

  Introduced in 1.11.29, fixed in 2.15.0
* 2020-03-24: Side channel during CBC padding

  The CBC padding operations were not constant time and as a result would leak
  the length of the plaintext values which were being padded to an attacker
  running a side channel attack via shared resources such as cache or branch
  predictor. No information about the contents was leaked, but the length alone
  might be used to make inferences about the contents. This issue affects TLS
  CBC ciphersuites as well as CBC encryption using PKCS7 or other similar padding
  mechanisms. In all cases, the unpadding operations were already constant time
  and are not affected. Reported by Maximilian Blochberger of UniversitÃ¤t
  Hamburg.

  Fixed in 2.14.0, all prior versions affected.

## 2018[Â¶](#id4 "Link to this heading")

* 2018-12-17 (CVE-2018-20187): Side channel during ECC key generation

  A timing side channel during ECC key generation could leak information about
  the high bits of the secret scalar. Such information allows an attacker to
  perform a brute force attack on the key somewhat more efficiently than they
  would otherwise. Found by JÃ¡n JanÄÃ¡r using ECTester.

  Introduced in 1.11.20, fixed in 2.8.0.
* 2018-06-13 (CVE-2018-12435): ECDSA side channel

  A side channel in the ECDSA signature operation could allow a local attacker
  to recover the secret key. Found by Keegan Ryan of NCC Group.

  Bug introduced in 2.5.0, fixed in 2.7.0. The 1.10 branch is not affected.
* 2018-04-10 (CVE-2018-9860): Memory overread in TLS CBC decryption

  An off by one error in TLS CBC decryption meant that for a particular
  malformed ciphertext, the receiver would miscompute a length field and HMAC
  exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer as if it was part of the
  message. This cannot be used to leak information since the MAC comparison will
  subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. However it might be used
  for denial of service. Found by OSS-Fuzz.

  Bug introduced in 1.11.32, fixed in 2.6.0
* 2018-03-29 (CVE-2018-9127): Invalid wildcard match

  RFC 6125 wildcard matching was incorrectly implemented, so that a wildcard
  certificate such as `b*.domain.com` would match any hosts `*b*.domain.com`
  instead of just server names beginning with `b`. The host and certificate
  would still have to be in the same domain name. Reported by Fabian WeiÃberg of
  Rohde and Schwarz Cybersecurity.

  Bug introduced in 2.2.0, fixed in 2.5.0

## 2017[Â¶](#id5 "Link to this heading")

* 2017-10-02 (CVE-2017-14737): Potential side channel using cache information

  In the Montgomery exponentiation code, a table of precomputed values
  is used. An attacker able to analyze which cache lines were accessed
  (perhaps via an active attack such as Prime+Probe) could recover
  information about the exponent. Identified in âCacheD: Identifying
  Cache-Based Timing Channels in Production Softwareâ by Wang, Wang,
  Liu, Zhang, and Wu (Usenix Security 2017).

  Fixed in 1.10.17 and 2.3.0, all prior versions affected.
* 2017-07-16: Failure to fully zeroize memory before free

  The secure\_allocator type attempts to zeroize memory before freeing it. Due to
  a error sometimes only a portion of the memory would be zeroed, because of a
  confusion between the number of elements vs the number of bytes that those
  elements use. So byte vectors would always be fully zeroed (since the two
  notions result in the same value), but for example with an array of 32-bit
  integers, only the first 1/4 of the elements would be zeroed before being
  deallocated. This may result in information leakage, if an attacker can access
  memory on the heap. Reported by Roman Pozlevich.

  Bug introduced in 1.11.10, fixed in 2.2.0
* 2017-04-04 (CVE-2017-2801): Incorrect comparison in X.509 DN strings

  Botanâs implementation of X.509 name comparisons had a flaw which
  could result in an out of bound memory read while processing a
  specially formed DN. This could potentially be exploited for
  information disclosure or denial of service, or result in incorrect
  validation results. Found independently by Aleksandar Nikolic of
  Cisco Talos, and OSS-Fuzz automated fuzzing infrastructure.

  Bug introduced in 1.6.0 or earlier, fixed in 2.1.0 and 1.10.16
* 2017-03-23 (CVE-2017-7252): Incorrect bcrypt computation

  Botanâs implementation of bcrypt password hashing scheme truncated long
  passwords at 56 characters, instead of at bcryptâs standard 72 characters
  limit. Passwords with lengths between these two bounds could be cracked more
  easily than should be the case due to the final password bytes being ignored.
  Found and reported by Solar Designer.

  Bug introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 2.1.0.

## 2016[Â¶](#id6 "Link to this heading")

* 2016-11-27 (CVE-2016-9132) Integer overflow in BER decoder

  While decoding BER length fields, an integer overflow could occur. This could
  occur while parsing untrusted inputs such as X.509 certificates. The overflow
  does not seem to lead to any obviously exploitable condition, but exploitation
  cannot be positively ruled out. Only 32-bit platforms are likely affected; to
  cause an overflow on 64-bit the parsed data would have to be many gigabytes.
  Bug found by Falko Strenzke, cryptosource GmbH.

  Fixed in 1.10.14 and 1.11.34, all prior versions affected.
* 2016-10-26 (CVE-2016-8871) OAEP side channel

  A side channel in OAEP decoding could be used to distinguish RSA ciphertexts
  that did or did not have a leading 0 byte. For an attacker capable of
  precisely measuring the time taken for OAEP decoding, this could be used as an
  oracle allowing decryption of arbitrary RSA ciphertexts. Remote exploitation
  seems difficult as OAEP decoding is always paired with RSA decryption, which
  takes substantially more (and variable) time, and so will tend to mask the
  timing channel. This attack does seems well within reach of a local attacker
  capable of a cache or branch predictor based side channel attack. Finding,
  analysis, and patch by Juraj Somorovsky.

  Introduced in 1.11.29, fixed in 1.11.33
* 2016-08-30 (CVE-2016-6878) Undefined behavior in Curve25519

  On systems without a native 128-bit integer type, the Curve25519 code invoked
  undefined behavior. This was known to produce incorrect results on 32-bit ARM
  when compiled by Clang.

  Introduced in 1.11.12, fixed in 1.11.31
* 2016-08-30 (CVE-2016-6879) Bad result from X509\_Certificate::allowed\_usage

  If allowed\_usage was called with more than one Key\_Usage set in the enum
  value, the function would return true if *any* of the allowed usages were set,
  instead of if *all* of the allowed usages are set. This could be used to
  bypass an application key usage check. Credit to Daniel Neus of Rohde &
  Schwarz Cybersecurity for finding this issue.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.31
* 2016-03-17 (CVE-2016-2849): ECDSA side channel

  ECDSA (and DSA) signature algorithms perform a modular inverse on the
  signature nonce k. The modular inverse algorithm used had input dependent
  loops, and it is possible a side channel attack could recover sufficient
  information about the nonce to eventually recover the ECDSA secret key. Found
  by Sean Devlin.

  Introduced in 1.7.15, fixed in 1.10.13 and 1.11.29
* 2016-03-17 (CVE-2016-2850): Failure to enforce TLS policy

  TLS v1.2 allows negotiating which signature algorithms and hash functions each
  side is willing to accept. However received signatures were not actually
  checked against the specified policy. This had the effect of allowing a
  server to use an MD5 or SHA-1 signature, even though the default policy
  prohibits it. The same issue affected client cert authentication.

  The TLS client also failed to verify that the ECC curve the server chose to
  use was one which was acceptable by the client policy.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.29
* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2196): Overwrite in P-521 reduction

  The P-521 reduction function would overwrite zero to one word
  following the allocated block. This could potentially result
  in remote code execution or a crash. Found with AFL

  Introduced in 1.11.10, fixed in 1.11.27
* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2195): Heap overflow on invalid ECC point

  The PointGFp constructor did not check that the affine coordinate
  arguments were less than the prime, but then in curve multiplication
  assumed that both arguments if multiplied would fit into an integer
  twice the size of the prime.

  The bigint\_mul and bigint\_sqr functions received the size of the
  output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in
  cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled
  multiplication function.

  The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding,
  which accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for
  remote code execution.

  On systems which use the mlock pool allocator, it would allow an
  attacker to overwrite memory held in secure\_vector objects. After
  this point the write will hit the guard page at the end of the
  mmapâed region so it probably could not be used for code execution
  directly, but would allow overwriting adjacent key material.

  Found by Alex Gaynor fuzzing with AFL

  Introduced in 1.9.18, fixed in 1.11.27 and 1.10.11
* 2016-02-01 (CVE-2016-2194): Infinite loop in modular square root algorithm

  The ressol function implements the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm for
  finding square roots could be sent into a nearly infinite loop due
  to a misplaced conditional check. This could occur if a composite
  modulus is provided, as this algorithm is only defined for primes.
  This function is exposed to attacker controlled input via the OS2ECP
  function during ECC point decompression. Found by AFL

  Introduced in 1.7.15, fixed in 1.11.27 and 1.10.11

## 2015[Â¶](#id7 "Link to this heading")

* 2015-11-04: TLS certificate authentication bypass

  When the bugs affecting X.509 path validation were fixed in 1.11.22, a check
  in Credentials\_Manager::verify\_certificate\_chain was accidentally removed
  which caused path validation failures not to be signaled to the TLS layer. So
  for affected versions, certificate authentication in TLS is bypassed. As a
  workaround, applications can override the call and implement the correct
  check. Reported by Florent Le Coz in GH #324

  Introduced in 1.11.22, fixed in 1.11.24
* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7824): Padding oracle attack on TLS

  A padding oracle attack was possible against TLS CBC ciphersuites because if a
  certain length check on the packet fields failed, a different alert type than
  one used for message authentication failure would be returned to the sender.
  This check triggering would leak information about the value of the padding
  bytes and could be used to perform iterative decryption.

  As with most such oracle attacks, the danger depends on the underlying
  protocol - HTTP servers are particularly vulnerable. The current analysis
  suggests that to exploit it an attacker would first have to guess several
  bytes of plaintext, but again this is quite possible in many situations
  including HTTP.

  Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.22
* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7825): Infinite loop during certificate path validation

  When evaluating a certificate path, if a loop in the certificate chain
  was encountered (for instance where C1 certifies C2, which certifies C1)
  an infinite loop would occur eventually resulting in memory exhaustion.
  Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Introduced in 1.11.6, fixed in 1.11.22
* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7826): Acceptance of invalid certificate names

  RFC 6125 specifies how to match a X.509v3 certificate against a DNS name
  for application usage.

  Otherwise valid certificates using wildcards would be accepted as matching
  certain hostnames that should they should not according to RFC 6125. For
  example a certificate issued for `*.example.com` should match
  `foo.example.com` but not `example.com` or `bar.foo.example.com`. Previously
  Botan would accept such a certificate as also valid for `bar.foo.example.com`.

  RFC 6125 also requires that when matching a X.509 certificate against a DNS
  name, the CN entry is only compared if no subjectAlternativeName entry is
  available. Previously X509\_Certificate::matches\_dns\_name would always check
  both names.

  Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Introduced in 1.11.0, fixed in 1.11.22
* 2015-10-26 (CVE-2015-7827): PKCS #1 v1.5 decoding was not constant time

  During RSA decryption, how long decoding of PKCS #1 v1.5 padding took was
  input dependent. If these differences could be measured by an attacker, it
  could be used to mount a Bleichenbacher million-message attack. PKCS #1 v1.5
  decoding has been rewritten to use a sequence of operations which do not
  contain any input-dependent indexes or jumps. Notations for checking constant
  time blocks with ctgrind (<https://github.com/agl/ctgrind>) were added to PKCS
  #1 decoding among other areas. Found in a review by Sirrix AG and 3curity GmbH.

  Fixed in 1.11.22 and 1.10.13. Affected all previous versions.
* 2015-08-03 (CVE-2015-5726): Crash in BER decoder

  The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an empty vector if
  it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain any data at all. This can be
  used to easily crash applications reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not
  seem exploitable for code execution. Found with afl.

  Fixed in 1.11.19 and 1.10.10, affected all previous versions of 1.10 and 1.11
* 2015-08-03 (CVE-2015-5727): Excess memory allocation in BER decoder

  The BER decoder would allocate a fairly arbitrary amount of memory in a length
  field, even if there was no chance the read request would succeed. This might
  cause the process to run out of memory or invoke the OOM killer. Found with afl.

  Fixed in 1.11.19 and 1.10.10, affected all previous versions of 1.10 and 1.11

## 2014[Â¶](#id8 "Link to this heading")

* 2014-04-10 (CVE-2014-9742): Insufficient randomness in Miller-Rabin primality check

  A bug in the Miller-Rabin primality test resulted in only a single random base
  being used instead of a sequence of such bases. This increased the probability
  that a non-prime would be accepted by is\_prime or that a randomly generated
  prime might actually be composite. The probability of a random 1024 bit
  number being incorrectly classed as prime with a single base is around 2^-40.
  Reported by Jeff Marrison.

  Introduced in 1.8.3, fixed in 1.10.8 and 1.11.9
