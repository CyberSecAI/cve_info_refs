{
  "CVE-2015-7560": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NTLMSSP authentication implementation in Samba does not properly implement the DCE-RPC layer, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to perform protocol downgrade attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Protocol downgrade vulnerability in NTLMSSP authentication that allows disabling security features like sealing or signing",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can remove encryption settings by modifying the client-server data stream and potentially disrupt LDAP security.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks, network traffic sniffing and modification.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between a client and server using Samba's NTLMSSP authentication. No prior authentication is required but attacker must have network position to intercept traffic."
  },
  "CVE-2015-5370": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DCE-RPC layer in Samba does not handle the protocol correctly, which allows remote attackers to perform protocol downgrade attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper implementation of DCE-RPC, allowing downgrade attacks which might cause denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform protocol downgrade attacks, cause a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code on a client system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can use unspecified vectors via network.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to send crafted packets to a vulnerable Samba server."
