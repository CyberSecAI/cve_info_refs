Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7500:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap buffer overflow in the `xmlParseMisc` function of libxml2. This function is responsible for parsing miscellaneous content within XML documents.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow caused by incorrect handling of entities boundaries within start tags during parsing.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can be exploited to cause:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): A specially crafted XML document can cause the application to crash.
    *   Potential Information Disclosure (implied): The Red Hat advisory mentions "leak potentially sensitive information", and the SUSE advisory mentions the possibility of "sensitive process memory information" being revealed.
*  **Attack vector:** A remote attacker could provide a maliciously crafted XML or HTML file. This requires the target application to use libxml2 for parsing such content.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious XML file to a system that uses libxml2. No authentication is required and the attack can be delivered through the network.

**2. Affected Software/Products:**

The vulnerability affects various operating systems and products including:

*   Apple tvOS 9.2
*   Apple watchOS 2.2
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
*  SUSE Linux Enterprise 11,12,15
*   openSUSE Leap 15.0, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
*   openSUSE Tumbleweed
*   Ubuntu 15.10, 15.04, 14.04, 12.04
*  Oracle Linux
*  Gentoo Linux

**3. Technical Details (from Red Hat and SUSE advisories):**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `xmlParseMisc` function, dealing with the parsing of XML.
*   The issue stems from incorrect processing of entity boundaries and start tags.
*   Specifically, a heap buffer overflow may occur.
*  The root cause in the libxml2 library is the way the xmlParseMisc() function handles entities. Specifically, during the parsing process, it does not correctly manage or validate the boundaries of entities within the start tags. This improper validation results in a situation where data might be written outside of the intended buffer, leading to memory corruption.

**4. Fixes and Mitigations:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `libxml2` versions 2.9.3 and later.
*   Patches have been backported for older systems by vendors.
*   Users are advised to upgrade to the latest available packages.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The content from both Red Hat and SUSE also mention additional CVEs fixed in the same update, which were all related to libxml2.
*  The Red Hat advisory mentions that affected applications could "crash the application" or "leak potentially sensitive information".
*  The SUSE advisory notes that the vulnerability may be used for a DoS attack or to obtain "sensitive process memory information".
*  The Gentoo advisory is relevant because it groups a variety of libxml2 issues (including CVE-2015-7500) into a single advisory.
*  The Apple advisories indicate that the issue was addressed through "improved memory handling," indicating a likely patch in memory management.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-7500 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability within the libxml2 library that can be triggered by parsing malicious XML/HTML. It could lead to denial of service and potential information leaks. This vulnerability requires a malicious XML file to be processed by an application using libxml2. Vendors have provided fixes with updates to the library, which users are advised to apply as soon as possible.
