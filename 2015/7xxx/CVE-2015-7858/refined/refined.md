Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Inadequate filtering of request data leads to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability within the Content History component of the Joomla administrator panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to retrieve active Super User sessions by stealing session IDs.
- With a valid session ID, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the Joomla backend.
- Once authenticated, an attacker can create a new template file containing malicious PHP payload.
- Remote Code Execution is then achieved by accessing this newly created file.
- Full administrative access to the Joomla site and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file.
- The attack involves manipulating the `list[select]` parameter within the request to inject SQL code.
- Once the admin session is hijacked, further requests are sent to the administrator panel to create new template files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla site.
- No prior authentication is necessary to exploit the SQL injection.
-  After gaining admin access, the attacker must craft specific requests to create template files and insert payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Joomla versions 3.2 up to 3.4.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4.5
- The exploit is publicly available as a Metasploit module.
- This vulnerability was discovered by Asaf Orpani of Trustwave and Netanel Rubin of PerimeterX.
- The exploit leverages the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve active Super User sessions and then abuses the template file creation mechanism for remote code execution.
