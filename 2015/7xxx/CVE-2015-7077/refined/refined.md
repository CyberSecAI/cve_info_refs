Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking in the `gst_configure` method of the `IGAccelGLContext` in the Intel Graphics Driver on macOS. This method takes an input structure of arbitrary size but doesn't validate the provided size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `gst_configure` method reads a dword at offset 0x800 of the input structure without checking if this offset is within the allocated buffer. This leads to an out-of-bounds read if the provided input structure is smaller than 0x800.
2.  **Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) Bug:** The value read at offset 0x800 is later used as the size parameter in a `memcpy` operation within `IntelAccelerator::gstqConfigure`. Because this value is not validated initially and can be changed after the initial out-of-bounds read due to heap manipulation by an attacker, a TOCTOU condition is created. An attacker can manipulate the heap such that the value at offset 0x800 is initially small during the first read but then changed to a larger value before the `memcpy` operation causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** By providing a small input structure with the value at offset 0x800 greater than 0x200, the out-of-bounds read will trigger a log message to `/var/log/system.log`, which is readable by a user. This allows an attacker to leak some kernel memory content.
2.  **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The TOCTOU vulnerability allows an attacker to control the size parameter of the `memcpy` leading to a heap overflow in the `_gstCustomCounterConfigPair` buffer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `gst_configure` method (external method 0x206) of the `IGAccelGLContext` IOKit driver.
*   This method is called through the MIG interface by userspace using `IOConnectCallMethod`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with IOKit driver through the `IOConnectCallMethod` interface.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the heap in order to trigger the TOCTOU vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit code provided demonstrates how to trigger this vulnerability using the IOKit API and `IOConnectCallMethod`, with the vulnerability residing in the `IGAccelGLContext` driver.
* The vulnerability was tested on OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 (15b42) on a MacBookAir5,2.
*   The provided exploit code first makes a call to `IOConnectCallMethod` using method ID `0x205` which is not related to this vulnerability. This was likely done to prepare the heap before triggering the vulnerability in method `0x206`.
