{
  "CVE-2015-7311": {
    "description": "libxl in Xen 4.1.x through 4.6.x does not properly handle the readonly flag on disks when using the qemu-xen device model, which allows local guest users to write to a read-only disk image.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libxl",
      "Xen hypervisor",
      "qemu-xen device model"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The libxl code doesn't pass the read-only flag to qemu-xen, and qemu itself does not have the functionality to make the disk read-only.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of readonly flag on disks with qemu-xen",
	  "Lack of validation of configurations"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious guest administrators or users can write to supposedly read-only disk images, leading to potential data modification or corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access from within a guest OS",
	  "Exploitation via devices emulated by the device model"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the guest OS with administrative privileges or control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line.",
	"additional_details": [
	  "CDROM devices are not affected",
	  "Systems using qemu-xen-traditional or stub domain device models are not affected",
	  "Issue is exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of the guest kernel or guest kernel command line if the host and guest together usually support PVHVM"
	],
    "remediation": "Applying provided patches to libxl will reject unsupported configurations that allow write access to read-only disks, or by switching to `qemu-xen-traditional` or using stub domains for device models.",
	"patches_available": true
  }
