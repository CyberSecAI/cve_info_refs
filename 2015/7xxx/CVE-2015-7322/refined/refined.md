Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7322

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way the Junos Pulse Collaboration Secure Meeting handles meeting IDs. It's possible to systematically try different meeting IDs and, based on the server's response, determine if a meeting ID exists and/or is still valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage. An attacker can determine the validity of meeting IDs by observing the server's responses.
*   **Lack of Proper Meeting ID Handling:** The system doesn't properly conceal the existence of valid meeting IDs, making them discoverable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can enumerate valid meeting IDs.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Combined with CVE-2015-7323 (mentioned in the advisory), it could allow an attacker to join protected meetings of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending requests to the Junos Pulse server.
*   **Systematic ID Guessing:** Attackers systematically try different meeting IDs and analyze the server responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Junos Pulse server.
*   **No Authentication Required for Discovery:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication (Guest Access).
*   **Ability to Send Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted requests to the server, typically by using the java client.
