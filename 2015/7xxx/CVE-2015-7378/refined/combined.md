# Panda Security 2016 Home User Products - Privilege Escalation

---

*From*: Kyriakos Economou <keconomou () nettitude com>

*Date*: Wed, 6 Apr 2016 09:54:26 +0000

---

```
* CVE: CVE-2015-7378
* Vendor: Panda Security
* Reported by: Kyriakos Economou
* Date of Release: 05/04/2016
* Affected Products: Multiple
* Affected Version: Panda Security URL Filtering < v4.3.1.9
* Fixed Version: Panda Security URL Filtering v4.3.1.9

Description:
All Panda Security 2016 Home User products for Windows are vulnerable to privilege escalation,  which allows a local
attacker to execute code as SYSTEM from any account (Guest included), thus completely compromising the affected host.

Affected Products:

Panda Gold Protection 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Global Protection 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Internet Security 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Antivirus Pro 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Free Antivirus v16.0.1

Impact:

A local attacker can elevate his privileges from any user account and execute code as SYSTEM.

Technical Details:

By default all the aforementioned products install (current version:4.3.0.4), which creates a service named
'panda_url_filtering' that runs as SYSTEM.
The executable modules are by default installed in "C:\ProgramData\Panda Security URL Filtering" directory.
However, the ACLs assigned to the directory itself, and to the rest of the installed files, allow any user to modify
those files and/or substitute them with malicious ones.
A local attacker can easily execute code with SYSTEM account privileges by modifying or substituting the main
executable  module of this service, 'Panda_URL_Filteringb.exe', which will run at the next reboot of the host.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
