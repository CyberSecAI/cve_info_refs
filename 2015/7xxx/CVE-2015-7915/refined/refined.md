Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure transmission of credentials in plaintext within the Sauter moduWeb Vision application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** The application transmits credentials in plain text, making them vulnerable to interception by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassing Authentication:** An attacker can intercept the credentials and use them to bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to use the system without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Sniffing:** Attackers can intercept the transmitted data if they have network access to the communication channel between the user and the moduWeb Vision application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to sniff network traffic to intercept the credentials being transmitted. This could be through a man-in-the-middle attack or by being on the same network as the affected system.
*   **Low Skill:** The provided information indicates that an attacker with low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 and a temporal score of 9.0, indicating a critical severity.
* The same encryption scheme used for password protection is used for authentication tokens, enabling potential privilege escalation.
* The vendor has released a firmware update (version 1.6.0) to address the vulnerability.
* The provided content includes references to other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7914 and CVE-2015-7916) affecting the same product.
