  "CVE-2015-7222": {
    "Description": "Integer underflow in the Metadata::setData function in MetaData.cpp in libstagefright in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (incorrect memory allocation and application crash) via an MP4 video file with crafted covr metadata that triggers a buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer underflow when processing 'covr' metadata in MP4 files due to insufficient bounds checking which can lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Underflow",
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Incorrect Memory Allocation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this via a crafted MP4 video file served through a website or another browser-like context.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malformed MP4 file with specific crafted covr metadata."
