Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient initialization of padding within Rx ACK packets in OpenAFS implementations derived from Project Andrew. Specifically, a variable-length padding added at the end of the ACK packet for MTU detection was not fully initialized. Only the first four bytes of this padding were initialized, leaving the rest uninitialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Initialization:** The Rx ACK packet padding wasn't fully initialized, leading to the leakage of data from previously used memory.
- **Memory Reuse:** Rx implementations reuse packet structures without zeroing them out, so uninitialized parts of the padding can contain remnants of previous packet data.
- **In-place decryption**: Decryption of packets is performed in place, thus making it more likely that decrypted content is leaked via ACK packets.
- **Duplicate Packet Handling:** When a duplicate or out-of-window packet is received, its decrypted content is immediately used to construct the return ACK packet, allowing an attacker to control leaked content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Plaintext Leakage:** An attacker can obtain portions of plaintext from previously processed packets by observing or triggering the transmission of ACK packets.
- **Information Disclosure:** Leaked plaintext can expose sensitive data, including potentially decrypted content of encrypted communications.
- **Control over Leaked Data**: By sending duplicate or out-of-window packets, attackers can control what plaintext is leaked in the ACK responses.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Passive Observation:** Attackers can passively monitor network traffic to capture ACK packets and extract leaked plaintext from them.
- **Active Injection:** Attackers can actively inject replayed, duplicate, or out-of-window packets to trigger the transmission of ACK packets containing chosen plaintext data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need the ability to observe network traffic between OpenAFS clients and servers.
- **Packet Injection:** To control the leaked content, attackers need to inject crafted packets into the network. This requires a position on the network that enables packet injection.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in OpenAFS versions prior to 1.7.33 and 1.6.15 and other software using Rx implementations derived from Project Andrew.
- The leaked plaintext amount can be up to the interface MTU minus approximately forty octets.
- The security advisory notes that the fcrypt encryption used by rxkad is weak, making the plaintext exposure more significant.
- CVE-2015-7763 is related to a second vulnerability CVE-2015-7762 where the size calculation of the packet left three bytes of padding uninitialized, which were also leaked.
