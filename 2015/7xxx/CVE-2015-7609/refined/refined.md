Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7609:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-7609 in multiple locations:
   - The bug report for bug 101436 includes `CVE Number: CVE-2015-7609`.
   - The bug report for bug 101435 also includes `CVE Number: CVE-2015-7609`
   - This indicates that both vulnerabilities were assigned the same CVE, likely due to their similar nature (XSS) and time of discovery.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Bug 101436:** The root cause is the lack of proper HTML encoding of folder names when they are displayed in error or warning dialogs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted folder name.
*   **Bug 101435:** The root cause is an overly permissive regex used by the "URL links" zimlet to identify UNC links. The regex incorrectly identifies a string containing javascript as a link, which causes the browser to execute the code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Both bugs involve XSS vulnerabilities (CWE-79), where malicious scripts can be injected and executed in the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input (folder names and email bodies) leads to the XSS.
*   **Insecure Regex:** The UNC link regex within the URL links zimlet was not sufficiently strict, leading to the identification of malicious javascript as a link.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies or session tokens to hijack the user's session.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal sensitive information from the user's account or machine.
*   **Account Takeover:** In the case of bug 101435, the attacker could potentially take over the victim's account.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Bug 101436:**
    *   An attacker creates a folder with a malicious name.
    *   When a user interacts with the folder, an error or warning dialog displays the folder name, triggering the XSS.
*   **Bug 101435:**
    *   An attacker sends an email with a crafted text string containing a javascript event handler such as `onmouseover="alert(/xss/)"`.
    *   The Zimbra web client incorrectly identifies this as a UNC link, and renders it as a link, which executes the code when hovered over.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Bug 101436:** An attacker needs the ability to create shared folders.
*   **Bug 101435:** An attacker needs the ability to send emails to a vulnerable user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes a link to a Fortinet advisory, indicating that the vulnerability was reported by FortiGuard Labs.
*   The bug reports mention that both issues were fixed by HTML-encoding folder names and refining the UNC regex, respectively.
*   The Zimbra Security Center wiki page shows that the fixes for these bugs were included in ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 5.
*   The Bugzilla entry for bug 101435 notes that a workaround is to disable or undeploy the com_zimbra_url (aka URL links) zimlet.

**In summary**, CVE-2015-7609 was assigned to two related but distinct XSS vulnerabilities in Zimbra Collaboration. One stemmed from improper handling of folder names in error dialogs, and the other from a faulty regex used by a zimlet that caused malicious javascript to be rendered as a link. Both allowed arbitrary code execution within a victim's browser, making them potentially serious security flaws. Both issues were resolved by encoding output in the former case, and refining the regex in the latter.
