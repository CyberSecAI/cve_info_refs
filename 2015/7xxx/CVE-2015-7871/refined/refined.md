Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-7871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A logic error in ntpd's handling of crypto-NAK packets when mobilizing new passive symmetric associations. This error bypasses the authentication normally required for establishing peer associations. The vulnerability was introduced when the code handling the mobilization of new passive symmetric associations was refactored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to bypass authentication when establishing a peer association.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The vulnerability is caused by an improper error condition handling related to crypto-NAK packets.
- **Unauthenticated Peer Association:** A passive peer association can be mobilized upon receiving a crypto-NAK packet, creating an ephemeral association that does not require cryptographically authenticated packets. The key ID used for this association defaults to 0, meaning no authentication is required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Time Changes:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can force an ntpd server to peer with a time source of their choice, potentially leading to arbitrary changes in the victim system's time.
- **Denial of Service:** By establishing many such peer associations, an attacker can cause the victim to reject legitimate peers, eventually leading to denial of service.
- **Acceptance of False Time:** Once the association is mobilized, nothing prevents an attacker from using the association to send false time updates.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Off-path Attack:** An attacker doesn't need to be directly in the network path between the client and server.
- **Spoofed Packets:** The attacker sends spoofed symmetric active crypto-NAK packets.
- **Unauthenticated Packets:** Crypto-NAK packets are not authenticated themselves, which allows an attacker to inject them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the target ntpd server.
- **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need to know the authentication keys since the vulnerability bypasses authentication.
- **Knowledge of NTP Protocol:** The attacker needs knowledge of the NTP protocol to craft crypto-NAK packets.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects `ntpd` versions between 4.2.5p186 and 4.2.8p4 and versions 4.3.0 up to but not including 4.3.77.
- The issue is related to refactoring of the code handling the mobilization of passive symmetric associations, specifically lines 1103-1165 in `ntp_proto.c`.
- The vulnerability is tracked as Bug 2941 in the NTP bug tracker.
- The CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability is 6.4 and CVSS v3.1 score is 9.8
- The only configuration directive that appears to prevent exploitation is the `notrust` restriction, which is incompatible with typical unauthenticated client-server configurations.
- It has been confirmed that the 4.2.6 version of NTP is not vulnerable because the ephemeral association is removed immediately after creation.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Van Gundy of Cisco ASIG.

In summary, this is a serious vulnerability that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate the system time of vulnerable ntpd servers, leading to potentially severe consequences.
