# Security Bulletin: IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) Hadoop connector is affected by a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7430)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in the IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) Hadoop connector which could allow an unprivileged user the ability to read, write, modify, or delete any data in a GPFS file system (CVE-2015-7430)

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7430](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7430) IBM General Parallel File System Hadoop connector could allow an unprivileged user the ability to read, write, modify, or delete any data in a GPFS file system.

CVSS Base Score: 8.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/107859> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) Hadoop connector 1.1.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7.0-0 thru 2.7.0-2

## Remediation/Fixes

Users of the IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) Hadoop connector should upgrade to 2.7.0-3 available at

<https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20%28GPFS%29/page/Hadoop%20Connector%20Download%20%26%20Info>

Uninstall the old connector and upgrade to 2.7.0-3. To upgrade the connector, see chapter 15 of the *Deploying a Big Data Solution using IBM Spectrum Scale* technical white paper at <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20%28GPFS%29/page/Big%20Data%20Best%20practices>.

After upgrading to 2.7.0.3:

If you have configured one group as **gpfs.supergroup** (e.g. gpfs.supergroup="hadoop"):

1. Create the directory **/var/mmfs/bi** on all nodes if the directory is not yet present.

2. Issue the **chown** <*anyone-super-user*>:<*super-group*> **/var/mmfs/bi** command on all nodes.

If the group **hadoop** is configured as **gpfs.supergroup** in connector

chown hdfs:hadoop /var/mmfs/bi

3. Issue the **chmod** command to limit access to the **hadoop** super group users

chmod 0660 /var/mmfs/bi

4. Restart the connector by issuing the commands on all nodes:

mmhadoopctl connector stop

mmhadoopctl connector start

If you have configured more than one group as **gpfs.supergroup** (e.g. gpfs.supergroup="bigsql,hadoop"):

1. Create the directory **/var/mmfs/bi** on all nodes if the directory is not yet present.

2. Issue the **chown** <*anyone-super-user*>:<*anyone-super-group*> **/var/mmfs/bi** command on all nodes.

If the group **hadoop** is configured as **gpfs.supergroup** in connector:

chown hdfs:hadoop /var/mmfs/bi

3. Issue the chmod command to limit access to the **hadoop** super group users:

chmod 0660 /var/mmfs/bi

4. Restart the connector by issuing the commands on all nodes:

mmhadoopctl connector stop

mmhadoopctl connector start

5. After you have restarted the connector daemon, for each *super\_group\_i*, issue:

setfacl -m g:*super\_group\_i*:rw /var/run/ibm\_bigpfs\_gcd

*For* *the GPFS Hadoop Connector 1.1.1,* *IBM recommends upgrading both your level of Hadoop and level of IBM Spectrun Scale (GPFS) Hadoop Connector code to current levels. See* [*https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20%28GPFS%29/page/Hadoop%20Connector%20Download%20%26%20Info*](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20%28GPFS%29/page/Hadoop%20Connector%20Download%20%26%20Info)
