Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-7358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt handle drive letter symbolic link creation on Windows. The `IsDriveLetterAvailable` function in the driver incorrectly determines if a drive letter is available by checking if a symbolic link with that name can be opened, using the NT_SUCCESS macro. This macro treats any error as success, allowing an attacker to bypass the check by creating an object of a different type with the same name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Drive Letter Availability Check:** The `IsDriveLetterAvailable` function uses `NT_SUCCESS` incorrectly, which leads to bypassing the check when it encounters an error while opening a symbolic link.
*   **Abuse of Device Map Directory:** An attacker can manipulate the device map directory of a process using `NtSetInformationProcess` and replace the global device map directory `\GLOBAL??`.
*  **Lack of Explicit Symbolic Link Path Specification:** The driver does not explicitly specify the location where symbolic links are written to, which allows an attacker to write them to a location of their choosing using techniques such as `NtSetInformationProcess`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Elevation of Privilege:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can remap existing drive letters, including the system drive (e.g., C:), to an encrypted volume they control. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by controlling the contents of the system drive or any other globally mounted drive.
*   **Complete Control over Drive Contents:**  Once a drive letter is remapped, the attacker gains full control over the contents of that drive, including the system drive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt Installation:** The target system must have TrueCrypt 7 or a derived product like VeraCrypt 1.13 or 1.14 installed.
*   **Abuse of Device Objects:** The attacker connects to the Truecrypt device object and attempts to mount an encrypted volume to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   A user with the ability to mount a volume through TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt drivers.
*   Knowledge of Windows object management and system calls like `NtSetInformationProcess` and `ZwOpenSymbolicLinkObject` to manipulate device map directories and create objects.
*   Ability to execute code locally.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in TrueCrypt 7 and its forks, like VeraCrypt 1.13 and 1.14.
*   The vulnerability was reported by James Forshaw from Google Security Research.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit is available which demonstrates how to remap an arbitrary global drive letter to a VeraCrypt volume.
*   The suggested fix involves changing `IsDriveLetterAvailable` to only return `FALSE` if `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND` is returned from the `ZwOpenSymbolicLinkObject` call or specifying the exact path of the symbolic link
*   The correct fix is to explicitly specify where the symbolic link needs to be written by specifying either the per-user directory at `\Sessions\0\DosDevices\X-Y` or `\GLOBAL??`.
