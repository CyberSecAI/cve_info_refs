Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7286:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of a weak, proprietary encryption scheme in the CSL DualCom CS2300-R alarm signalling boards. This scheme is a form of polyalphabetic substitution cipher, similar to a Vigen√®re cipher, but with a fixed key, making it vulnerable to cryptanalysis.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Broken Cryptographic Algorithm:** The encryption algorithm is fundamentally flawed, easily decrypted using basic cryptanalysis techniques.
*   **Fixed Encryption Key:** The encryption key (mapping table) is hardcoded in the firmware and is the same across all devices and all firmware versions (v1.25 - v3.53) and cannot be changed.
*   **Short Effective Key Length:**  The key is relatively short, making brute-force attacks feasible.
*   **Lack of Message Integrity:** Messages lack sequence numbers, checksums, hashes, and message authentication codes (MACs), making them susceptible to tampering.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  The device's ICCID and chip number, used for identification, are transmitted in each message which can be easily decrypted and used to spoof messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of Communications:** Attackers can easily decrypt the communications between the CS2300-R devices and the Alarm Receiving Centers (ARCs).
*   **Message Spoofing:** Attackers can forge messages, potentially sending false alarms, suppressing genuine alarms, or causing denial of service.
*   **General Inability to Trust Communications:** The lack of secure communication can lead to a complete loss of trust in the alarm system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the device and the ARC can intercept and manipulate messages. The use of GPRS or the internet allows for such positioning remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to intercept network communications between the CSL DualCom CS2300-R and the monitoring center. This could be achieved by setting up a rogue GPRS cell tower or via a man-in-the-middle attack on the IP network if the device is connected via the internet.
*   The attacker must also have the capability to perform cryptanalysis using the cipher and fixed key. This is relatively easy.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The encryption algorithm is described as being on a par with techniques state-of-the-art in the time before computers, and that it offers "nanosecond scale brute force" security.
*   The vendor, CSL DualCom, has stated that the product is certified to the required European standard EN-50136, but there is no evidence that the standard tests for actual cryptographic security.
*   The devices are not able to receive firmware updates over the air, making it impossible to fix the vulnerability on deployed units.
*   The vendor has disputed the researcher's findings, stating that their internal review concluded there is no threat.
*   There's concern that CSL doesn't have a security-focused development culture, as evidenced by other security issues related to their company.
*   The vendor's statements suggest that they believe the units are not designed to be protected against the type of attack described in the research, which is contradicted by the use of a communications path.
* The vendor has indicated they are releasing a new product in May that will address these areas.

This vulnerability is considered severe due to the potential for widespread disruption of alarm systems, with a CVSS base score of 9.3.
