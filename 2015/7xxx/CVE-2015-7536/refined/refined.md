- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate handling of user-generated content within workspace files and archived artifacts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Low privilege users could create HTML files containing malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into workspace files or archived artifacts, which would then execute when accessed by other users.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating malicious HTML files in workspaces or archived artifacts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privilege user account on the Jenkins server. The attacker needs to be able to create files in workspaces or artifacts.
