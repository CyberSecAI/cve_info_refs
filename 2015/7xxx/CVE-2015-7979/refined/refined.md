{
  "CVE-2015-7979": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in NTP's broadcast mode allowed remote attackers to send packets with bad authentication, disrupting synchronization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication handling",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Clients would break their association with the broadcast server, causing time synchronization to become out of sync over a longer period of time.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker broadcasting malformed NTP packets with bad authentication."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker"
  },
  "CVE-2016-1547": {
    "Root cause": "A denial of service flaw existed in the way NTP handled preemptable client associations, allowing attackers to disrupt time synchronization.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of preemptable client associations"
    ],
     "Impact": "A remote attacker could send several crypto NAK packets to a victim client, each with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer, preventing that client from synchronizing its time.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending crypto NAK packets with spoofed source addresses."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with ability to spoof source addresses."
  },
   "CVE-2016-1548": {
    "Root cause": "An ntpd client could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to the interleaved symmetric mode, leading to denial of service.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of mode switching"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could use a spoofed packet that, when processed by an ntpd client, would cause that client to reject all future legitimate server responses, effectively disabling time synchronization on that client.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Remote attacker sending a spoofed packet forcing client to interleaved symmetric mode"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with ability to send spoofed packets."
  },
  "CVE-2016-1550": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the way NTP's libntp performed message authentication, allowing for potential message digest recovery.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Timing attack vulnerability in message authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker able to observe the timing of the comparison function used in packet authentication could potentially use this flaw to recover the message digest.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Attacker observing timing of the comparison function during authentication."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs the ability to observe timing of authentication process."
  },
    "CVE-2016-2518": {
    "Root cause": "An out-of-bounds access flaw in ntpd processing of crafted packets, potentially leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds access",
         "Improper handling of crafted packets"
      ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker could use a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode of 7 and larger, which could potentially (although highly unlikely) cause ntpd to crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Authenticated attacker sending crafted packets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated attacker with the ability to create crafted packets."
