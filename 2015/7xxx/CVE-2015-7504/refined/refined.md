  "CVE-2015-7504": {
    "description": "Qemu emulator built with the AMD PC-Net II Ethernet Controller support is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow flaw. While receiving packets in the loopback mode, it appends CRC code to the receive buffer. If the data size given is same as the receive buffer size, the appended CRC code overwrites 4 bytes beyond this 's->buffer' array.  A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the Qemu process on the host.",
    "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow due to incorrect handling of CRC code appending in loopback mode within the AMD PC-Net II Ethernet Controller emulation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash of the host QEMU process) or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network packets received in loopback mode."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged user (with CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability) inside a guest."
