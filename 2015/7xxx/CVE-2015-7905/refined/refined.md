The provided content describes three distinct vulnerabilities that are all associated with CVE-2015-7905. All three vulnerabilities exist within the IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX control used by Unitronics UniDownloader and/or Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `PostDataB` and `FirewallDataB` properties of the `IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1` ActiveX control. The control takes a value from the script, treats it as the address of a SafeArray, and processes information from the SafeArray structure.
*   **Weaknesses:** Type confusion vulnerability. The control does not properly validate or sanitize the input, treating arbitrary data as a SafeArray.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution under the context of the process running the vulnerable software.
*   **Attack vectors:** Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file containing specially crafted script that exploits the vulnerable control.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, but requires user interaction (visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file).

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `SSLCertHandle` property of the `IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1` ActiveX control.
*  **Weaknesses:**  The ActiveX control can be made to treat arbitrary memory as a certificate structure, which is then modified by the software.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution under the context of the user.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file containing specially crafted script that exploits the vulnerable control.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, but requires user interaction (visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file).

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `WinSockPath` property of the `IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1` ActiveX control.
*   **Weaknesses:** The control passes the provided property value as a URL for a DLL to the `LoadLibraryA` API. This allows an attacker to specify a malicious DLL path, and the DLL will be loaded and executed (DllMain).
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution under the context of the process running the vulnerable software.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file containing specially crafted script that exploits the vulnerable control.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, but requires user interaction (visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file).
