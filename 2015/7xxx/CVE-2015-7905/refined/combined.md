## Unitronics UniDownloader and Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX Control PostDataB/FirewallDataB Properties Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-576ZDI-CAN-2965

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-7905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7905) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Unitronics](http://www.unitronics.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | UniDownloader VisiLogic OPLC IDE |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics UniDownloader and Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within processing of the PostDataB and FirewallDataB properties of the IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX control. Both properties take a value from the script and treat it as the address of a SafeArray and then process information from the SafeArray structure. An attacker can leverage this type confusion to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Unitronics has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2015-05-28 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2015-12-02 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## Unitronics UniDownloader IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX Control SSLCertHandle Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-575ZDI-CAN-2930

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-7905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7905) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Unitronics](http://www.unitronics.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | UniDownloader |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics UniDownloader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within processing of the SSLCertHandle property of the IPWorksSSL.HTTPS ActiveX control. A crafted value can cause system software to treat arbitrary memory as a certificate structure which is then modified. An attacker can leverage this to attain remote code execution under the context of the user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Unitronics has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## Unitronics UniDownloader and Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX Control WinSockPath Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-574ZDI-CAN-2964

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-7905](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7905) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Unitronics](http://www.unitronics.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | UniDownloader VisiLogic OPLC IDE |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics UniDownloader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within implementation of the WinSockPath property of the HTTPS ActiveX control. The control passes this property as the URL for a DLL to the LoadLibraryA API, which will automatically execute DllMain in the DLL. This can be leveraged by an attacker for remote code execution in the context of the process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Unitronics has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
