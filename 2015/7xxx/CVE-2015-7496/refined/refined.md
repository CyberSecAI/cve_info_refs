{
  "CVE-2015-7496": {
    "Description": "It was found that gdm could crash due to a signal handler dispatched to an invalid conversation. An attacker could crash gdm by holding the escape key when the screen is locked, possibly bypassing the locked screen.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The worker proxy was not being properly disposed when the conversation associated with it was freed, leading to signal handlers being dispatched after the conversation was freed, causing a crash.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper resource management",
       "Signal handling issues",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The gdm process crashes, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the locked screen.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local/Physical access, holding escape key while screen is locked.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local or physical access to the system and the ability to lock the screen.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was triggered by repeatedly pressing the Escape key while the screen lock was active, causing the gdm to crash after about 5 times. This issue was also present when using XDMCP."
