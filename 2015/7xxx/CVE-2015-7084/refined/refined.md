Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a race condition in the `IORegistryIterator::reset` and `IORegistryIterator::exitEntry` methods within the IOKit framework. Specifically, it involves a double-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Race Condition:** Multiple threads can call `IORegistryIterator::reset` or `IORegistryIterator::exitEntry` concurrently.
2.  **Double-Free:** The `done` member (in `reset`) or the `where` member (in `exitEntry`) of the `IORegistryIterator` can be released multiple times, leading to a double free.
3. **Lack of Locking:** The registry APIs lack proper locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access and modification to shared data structures, exacerbating the race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Kernel Code Execution:** By controlling the freed object, an attacker can overwrite the vtable pointer with a pointer to a controlled heap allocation. This allows them to control the instruction pointer when `release()` is called, leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
2.  **Denial of Service:** The double-free can cause a crash of the system, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Userspace API Calls:** The `IOIteratorReset` method (for `reset`) and `IORegistryIteratorExitEntry` (for `exitEntry`) can be called from userspace, making the vulnerability reachable from sandboxed applications.
2. **Thread Race:** Multiple threads are created to trigger the race condition and cause the double free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to execute the exploit.
2.  **Ability to Create Threads:** The attacker needs to be able to create multiple threads to trigger the race condition.
3.  **Ability to Call IOKit Functions:** The attacker needs to be able to use the IOKit API to call the vulnerable methods.
4. **Knowledge of Kernel Heap:** The attacker needs to understand how the kernel heap works and the location of the freelist to gain code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both OS X and iOS.
*   The exploit can be triggered from within a sandbox.
*   The exploit uses heap spraying/poisoning to gain instruction pointer control by overwriting the vtable pointer with a controlled address.

The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the double-free using multiple threads.

The Apple security advisories mention that this issue was addressed through improved memory handling.
