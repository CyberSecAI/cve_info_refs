# **Identify** your vulnerabilities

## before others do …

# **Secure?** For Sure!

![Expresse](/assets/images/expresse.jpg)

**Nowadays** itâs incredibly hard to imagine companies are not relying on IT-systems as they, most of the time secretly in the background, fulfill important tasks. From office networks or internet portals for clients and partners up to highly-specified assembly lines in factories, IT systems and their services enable employers to work more efficient.

Even business critical processes depend more and more on smoothly flowing IT services. Most of the time this is accomplished by using a broad set of different IT products and technologies. Besides high availability of these services, particularly the security of processed data is important. Needless to say, no company wants to see their confidential information in the hands of someone else.

How can we permanently maintain a level of highest security? And just as important, how can one make sure that current security is adequate?

Profundis Labs is an IT Security company based in Munich Germany. We provide consulting services and technical assessments like [**Penetration Tests**](/services/penetrationtest) and [**Security Audits**](/services/audit) to actively check the security of your company data. Furthermore our consulting service is independent of manufacturers and weâll make your employees become more aware to the issue of security.

CVE-2015-7677
VENDOR Reference:
=================
http://docs.ipswitch.com/MOVEit/DMZ82/ReleaseNotes/MOVEitReleaseNotes82.pdf
Reference Number: MIDMZ-6126
Vulnerability Details:
======================
It is possible to enumerate valid FileIDs by using the MOVEitISAPI service.
According to whether a FileID exists or not, a different error message is returned from the server.
It is possible to write a program which automatically tries different FileIDs and
identifies existing FileIDs. Those FileIDs may later be used for unauthorized access the corresponding file using vulnerability
CVE-2015-7675 (https://profundis-labs.com/advisories/CVE-2015-7675.txt).
To exploit this vulnerability, the following information is needed:
- A valid user account (user session)
PoC code(s):
============
POST /MOVEitISAPI/MOVEitISAPI.dll?action=download HTTP/1.1
Host:
...
X-siLock-FileID:
The response from server can be evaluated as followed:
- FileID exists but user is not permitted, error message:
"Sie sind nicht zum Lesen dieser Datei berechtigt" (Error message is in German, it may differ in setups with other languages)
- FileID does not exist, error message: No such file ID "" (this error message is always in English)
