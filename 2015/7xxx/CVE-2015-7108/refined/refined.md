Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient`'s external method dispatching mechanism. Specifically, the `SimpleDispatchWL` function does not validate the size of the `structInput` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `SimpleDispatchWL` function reads a value from offset `+0x70` of the `structInput`. Since the size of the `structInput` isn't checked, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Unvalidated function pointer dereference:** The code fetches a value from `structInput+0x70` twice, using the first value to validate an index into a function pointer table and the second to fetch and call the corresponding pointer from said table. An attacker can cause a second read of `structInput+0x70` to produce a different index than the first, leading to the retrieval and execution of an attacker-controlled function pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary kernel code execution:** Due to the out-of-bounds read and the subsequent function pointer dereference, a local user can execute arbitrary code within the kernel context, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted IOConnectCallMethod request to the `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` with a small input structure and a specific method number (21). The attacker needs to manipulate memory between the two reads at the vulnerable offsets to bypass checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to interact with the `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` service and trigger the vulnerable code path.
- **Ability to send IOKit messages:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send IOKit messages to the `IOBluetoothHCIUserClient` service to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted message to the vulnerable IOKit driver.
- The exploit code uses gazalloc boot args (`debug=0x144 -v pmuflags=1 kdp_match_name=en3 gzalloc_min=100 gzalloc_max=300`) to control kernel memory allocation and reliably trigger the vulnerability, which requires manipulating memory between the two vulnerable accesses.
- This vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.

The provided information gives a good explanation of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited, which is more detailed than the initial CVE description.
