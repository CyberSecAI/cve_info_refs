Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7724

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of POSIX shared memory within the AMD fglrx-driver. Specifically, the `shm_open()` function is called with flags that allow symlink following, and the created shared memory object has insecure permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure `shm_open()` flags:** The `shm_open()` call uses `O_CREAT | O_RDWR` but lacks `O_EXCL`. This allows the function to follow an existing symlink under `/dev/shm`.
2.  **Insecure Default Permissions:** The code requests that newly created files have permissions of 0666, which can lead to an arbitrary file, owned by root, to be created anywhere on the filesystem.
3.  **Forced 0666 permissions:** The code explicitly sets permissions to 0666 using `fchmod()`, which is a problem if the symlink target already exists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker can create or overwrite arbitrary files with 0666 permissions anywhere on the file system. The attacker gains the ability to create files owned by root which can lead to further privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Symlink Attack:** An attacker can create a symlink in `/dev/shm` pointing to an arbitrary file on the filesystem. The vulnerable `shm_open()` call will follow this symlink and create/overwrite the target file with root ownership and insecure permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable AMD fglrx-driver is installed.
*  The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links within /dev/shm.
*   The vulnerability is present in the userland part of the fglrx-driver so no direct access to the kernel is required.
