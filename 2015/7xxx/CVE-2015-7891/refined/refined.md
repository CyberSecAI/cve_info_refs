{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-7891",
  "description": "The Samsung Graphics 2D driver (/dev/fimg2d) is accessible by unprivileged users/applications. It was found that the ioctl implementation for this driver contains a locking error which can lead to memory errors (such as use-after-free) due to a race condition.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `g2d_lock` and `g2d_unlock` routines are no-ops when `BLIT_WORKQUE` is defined, which appears to be the default configuration. However, the alternative spin lock routines are not consistently used with this configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Concurrency issue due to missing or incorrect locking mechanism.",
      "Race condition leading to use-after-free."
    ],
     "impact": "Memory errors such as use-after-free, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.",
     "attack_vectors": "Local access to the `/dev/fimg2d` device.",
      "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user/application with access to the `/dev/fimg2d` device. Requires the ability to open the device and concurrently call the `FIMG2D_BITBLT_BLIT` ioctl from multiple processes."
