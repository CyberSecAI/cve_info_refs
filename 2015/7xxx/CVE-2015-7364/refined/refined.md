Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism within the HTML_Quickform library, which is used by Revive Adserver. The CSRF protection could be bypassed by sending an empty token along with the POST data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of the CSRF token. Specifically, the application fails to reject requests with an empty CSRF token, effectively rendering the CSRF protection ineffective.
- The `HTML_Quickform` library is used to generate forms in Revive Adserver's admin interface, and the library failed to properly validate the token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to perform a variety of malicious actions, including:
   - Modifying entities such as banners and zones.
   - Altering user preferences and settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request that includes an empty CSRF token.
   - The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
   - The attacker would need to trick the victim into submitting a malicious form or navigate to a malicious page that submits the form with an empty token on the victim's behalf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
  - The attacker needs to be able to induce a user with a valid session to submit a malicious request (e.g., via a crafted link or malicious website)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Revive Adserver versions 3.2.1 and earlier.
- The fix involves adding a requirement for a non-empty token and using a `required` rule to enforce this.
- A commit [revive-adserver/revive-adserver@288f81cc](https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/288f81cc) addresses this issue by adding a check to ensure the token is not empty and updating the `accept` method to include required and error information.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "moderate."
- This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
