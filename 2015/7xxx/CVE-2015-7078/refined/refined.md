Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) issue in the hypervisor driver (specifically `AppleHV`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `hv_space` lock group gets an extra reference dropped when a process with an `AppleHV` user client is terminated.
  - One drop occurs via `IOService::terminateWorker` calling `AppleHVClient::free`, which uses a pointer from the global `_hv` variable.
  - A second drop occurs via the hypervisor `machine_thread_destroy` callback (`hv_callback_thread_destroy`), which also uses a lock group pointer from `_hv`.
  - This double free leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- The provided exploit code causes a denial of service (DoS) by triggering the UAF condition, but can potentially be leveraged for code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local user interaction.
- A local user can exploit this by creating an `AppleHV` user client and then terminating the process associated with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create an `AppleHV` userclient and then terminate it.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code provided in the `exploit-db` entry demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by repeatedly opening and closing connections to the "AppleHV" service.
- The `support.apple.com` document confirms that this vulnerability was fixed in OS X El Capitan 10.11.2, Security Update 2015-005 Yosemite, and Security Update 2015-008 Mavericks.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
