Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-7798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in multiple functions within Cybozu Office. Specifically, this CVE is associated with the following CyVDB entries: CyVDB-894, CyVDB-792, CyVDB-782, and CyVDB-781. These entries relate to specific functions or screens within the application including the address book, file management, and the start menu.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- Potential for further attacks:  An attacker can leverage XSS to perform actions such as session hijacking, defacement, data theft, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- Malicious Input:  Attackers can inject malicious scripts via request parameters. Specific vulnerable areas include the address book screen, file management, and start menu.
