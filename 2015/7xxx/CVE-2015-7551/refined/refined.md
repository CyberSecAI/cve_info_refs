{
  "CVE-2015-7551": {
    "Description": "The Fiddle::Handle implementation in ext/fiddle/handle.c in Ruby before 2.0.0-p648, 2.1 before 2.1.8, and 2.2 before 2.2.4, as distributed in Apple OS X before 10.11.4 and other products, mishandles tainting, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted string, related to the DL module and the libffi library. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2009-5147 regression.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by mishandling of tainted strings in `Fiddle::Handle` and `DL` modules. Specifically, functions within these modules that handle string inputs from users do not properly validate or sanitize tainted strings before passing them to underlying system calls or libraries. This allows for the possibility of executing arbitrary code or causing a denial of service.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of tainted strings leading to use of untrusted data in operations.",
      "Lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied strings.",
      "Reintroduction of a previously patched vulnerability due to refactoring of the code using Fiddle and libffi."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing specially crafted strings as input when using Fiddle::Handle or DL modules.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by providing maliciously crafted string inputs to the `Fiddle::Handle.new` constructor or the `[]` method used to resolve function pointers.  This can occur through user input or configuration settings that directly control the arguments passed to these functions.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to provide input strings to the affected Ruby code. This could involve local access to modify configuration or control parameters passed to affected methods, or in cases where a program accepts user input strings and uses them in a vulnerable manner.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2009-5147.",
        "The vulnerability was introduced due to reimplementation of DL using Fiddle and libffi",
        "The patch for the vulnerability involves checking if the strings are tainted and raising a `SecurityError` if they are and `$SAFE` is > 0."
