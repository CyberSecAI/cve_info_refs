Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-7830:

**1.  Verification of CVE relevance:**

*   The content from `www.wireshark.org` and `www.zerodayinitiative.com` directly mentions `CVE-2015-7830` in relation to a "Pcapng file parser crash".
*   The `www.suse.com` content includes a description of CVE-2015-7830, stating "The pcapng_read_if_descr_block function in wiretap/pcapng.c in the pcapng parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.8 uses too many levels of pointer indirection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service".
*   The SUSE bugzilla entry 950437 also relates to this CVE.
*   Therefore, this content is directly related to CVE-2015-7830.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `pcapng_read_if_descr_block` function within the pcapng parser of Wireshark.
*   The root cause is "too many levels of pointer indirection".
*   This occurs during the copying of an interface filter.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The `pcapng_read_if_descr_block` function lacks proper checks when copying interface filters.
*   Specifically, there's insufficient validation of how pointers are handled.
*   This leads to an "incorrect free" operation when a malformed filter is processed.
*   The vulnerability occurs when the Pcapng file parser copies an interface filter.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   A successful attack results in a denial of service (DoS).
*   The application crashes due to the memory corruption (incorrect free).
*   In some cases, this could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the the current process.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   Attackers can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a malformed pcapng file.
*   The crafted file can be delivered in different ways:
     * By injecting a malformed packet on the wire.
     * By convincing someone to open a malformed pcapng file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of this malformed file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to either send crafted network packets that will be captured by the vulnerable application.
*   Or, they need to be able to convince a user to open a malicious pcapng file.
*   No special privileges are needed on the targeted system.
*   The attacker can be remote to the target.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.x before 1.12.8.
*   The SUSE content also indicates that older versions of Wireshark might be affected as well.
*   The vulnerability is considered "moderate" in severity by SUSE.
*   A fix is available in Wireshark 1.12.8 and later versions.

In summary, CVE-2015-7830 is caused by a pointer indirection issue in Wireshark's pcapng parser that can be exploited with crafted pcapng files to cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
