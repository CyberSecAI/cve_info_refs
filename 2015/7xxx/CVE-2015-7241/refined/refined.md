  "cve": "CVE-2015-7241",
  "description": "XML External Entity Injection vulnerability has been found in the XML parser in the System Administration->XML Content and Actions -> Import section.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application processes XML documents without properly sanitizing external entities, allowing an attacker to include and process external resources.",
      "Improper handling of file:// protocol which allows reading arbitrary files from the server and potentially causing denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data such as NTLM hashes, by forcing the application to make requests to a controlled server or access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious XML document containing a reference to an external entity (e.g., using the file:// protocol)",
	  "Importing this crafted XML via the System Administration->XML Content and Actions -> Import section."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to import XML files through the specified administration interface and needs a controlled server to receive the NTLM hash"
  }
