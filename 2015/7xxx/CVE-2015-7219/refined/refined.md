{
  "CVE-2015-7219": {
    "Description": "The HTTP/2 implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer underflow, assertion failure, and application exit) via a malformed PushPromise frame that triggers decompressed-buffer length miscalculation and incorrect memory allocation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer underflow due to a miscalculation of the decompressed buffer length when handling a malformed HTTP/2 PushPromise frame, leading to incorrect memory allocation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Incorrect memory allocation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application exit, triggered by an assertion failure due to excessive memory allocation).",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a malformed HTTP/2 PushPromise frame to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and needs to send the specific malformed HTTP/2 frame to trigger the vulnerability."
