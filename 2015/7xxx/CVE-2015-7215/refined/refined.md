{
  "CVE-2015-7215": {
    "description": "The importScripts function in the Web Workers API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy by triggering use of the no-cors mode in the fetch API to attempt resource access that throws an exception, leading to information disclosure after a rethrow.",
    "root_cause": "The importScripts function in Web Workers does not properly handle cross-origin exceptions when using the no-cors fetch mode, leading to an information leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of cross-origin exceptions",
       "Violation of Same Origin Policy"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the Same Origin Policy and potentially gather sensitive information, including authentication tokens and other data from third-party websites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attacker entices a user to load a malicious web page that uses a web worker and the importScripts function to fetch a cross-origin resource.",
       "The no-cors mode of the fetch API is used to attempt cross-origin access, triggering an exception"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and entice a user to visit it.",
    "additional_details": "The issue is not specific to Mozilla products and affects other browsers as well. It involves a cross-origin information leak through the error events in web workers. The vulnerability occurs when an exception is rethrown from a cross-origin importScripts() operation. This allows an attacker to read information about a cross-origin resource, like whether a user is logged into a service or not, or other details."
