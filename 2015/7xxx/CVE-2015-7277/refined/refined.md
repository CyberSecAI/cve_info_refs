Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Amped Wireless R10000 router uses default, non-random credentials (admin:admin) for its web administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-255: Credentials Management**: The use of default credentials allows unauthorized access to the router's web management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Control:** A local area network attacker can gain complete control of the device by logging in using the default credentials.
*   **Remote Attacks:** The default credentials can be leveraged in remote attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), when combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Privileged Access:** An attacker gains privileged access to the device's web management interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network Attack:** An attacker on the same local network as the router can directly attempt to log in using the default credentials.
*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can leverage the default credentials in combination with other vulnerabilities, like CSRF, for remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** A local attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router to directly exploit this vulnerability by attempting to log in using the default credentials.
*   **Remote Attack (with CSRF):** In a remote attack, the attacker would need to induce a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request or establish an active session using the default credentials as part of the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document also discusses other vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-7278 for CSRF and CVE-2015-7279 for DNS spoofing), but this analysis focuses specifically on CVE-2015-7277.
*   The vendor was notified but has not provided a statement.
*   The provided solution suggests using strong passwords and limiting network access as a workaround.
