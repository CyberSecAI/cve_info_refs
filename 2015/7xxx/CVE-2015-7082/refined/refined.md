Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities existing in Git versions prior to 2.5.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Protocols:** Some protocols, like `git-remote-ext`, can execute arbitrary code found in the URL. Submodule URLs, which may come from untrusted sources like `.gitmodules` files in remote repositories, can be exploited.
*   **Integer Overflow in xdiff:** The `xdiff` code, used for generating diffs, uses "int" in multiple places. This can lead to integer overflows when processing extremely large files, which may cause unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious URLs, particularly when users blindly enable recursive fetches.
*   **Unspecified Impacts Due to Integer Overflow:** The integer overflow in `xdiff` when processing large files could lead to unspecified negative consequences, likely affecting the stability or integrity of diff generation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs in Submodules:** Attackers can embed malicious URLs in the `.gitmodules` files of a remote repository.
*   **Large Files for xdiff Overflow:** Attackers can provide unusually large files to trigger the integer overflow in the `xdiff` code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For arbitrary code execution: Attackers need the ability to influence the `.gitmodules` file of a repository that a user clones recursively.
*  For the integer overflow, an attacker needs to have control over the files that are being compared by git diff.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Apple document specifies that the vulnerabilities were addressed by updating Git to version 2.5.4.
* The git release notes from github provide some context on the nature of the fix, indicating that the protocols allowed for submodule URLs have been restricted and that the input size for xdiff was capped.
