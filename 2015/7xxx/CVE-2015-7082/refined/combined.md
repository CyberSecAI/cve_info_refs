Fixes since v2.5.4------------------
 \* xdiff code we use to generate diffs is not prepared to handle extremely large files. It uses "int" in many places, which can overflow if we have a very large number of lines or even bytes in our input files, for example. Cap the input size to somewhere around 1GB for now.
 \* Some protocols (like git-remote-ext) can execute arbitrary code found in the URL. The URLs that submodules use may come from arbitrary sources (e.g., .gitmodules files in a remote repository), and can hurt those who blindly enable recursive fetch. Restrict the allowed protocols to well known and safe ones.
