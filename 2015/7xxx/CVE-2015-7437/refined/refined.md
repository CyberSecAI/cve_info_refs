Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7437:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Queue Watcher was displaying sensitive information (specifically, encrypted passwords) in clear text. This occurred when viewing the `si.config` properties through the Queue Watcher's "View Properties" function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary weakness is the exposure of encrypted database passwords in clear text.
- Insecure display of sensitive data: Encrypted passwords were not properly masked or handled, making them visible in plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential compromise of database credentials.
- An attacker with access to the Sterling B2B Integrator Queue Watcher could easily view and steal the database passwords. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the Sterling B2B Integrator Queue Watcher.
- Access to the Queue Watcher is necessary for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Sterling B2B Integrator Queue Watcher. This may involve having some level of administrative privileges or access to the application's interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Sterling Integrator 5.1 and IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2.
- Fixes are available through specific APARs (IC99482) and associated fix packs.
- The issue is related to the `si.config` file and how passwords are being displayed in the Queue Watcher interface.
- Database passwords, although encrypted in configuration files such as `sandbox.cfg`, `apservsetup`, and `jdbc.properties`, are being shown in clear text in the Queue Watcher.
