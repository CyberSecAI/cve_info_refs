Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7679:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient input validation in the MOVEit Mobile application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. This occurs when the application echoes unsanitized user input within the HTTP response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the victim's session cookies to gain unauthorized access to their account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Exfiltrating sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fake login forms to capture the victim's credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in a parameter.
*   The attacker would need to entice the victim to click on this specially crafted URL, often through social engineering or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute malicious URLs.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or access to the application.
*   The attacker does need to persuade a user to click on the malicious link for the attack to succeed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `MOVEit Mobile (v1.2.0.962) and below` application.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `org` parameter, within the URL.
*   The attack vector uses the following pattern: `https://<host>:8443/mobile/?org%22}%27;alert%28%27XSS%27%29;//`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory includes a CVSS v3 score of 6.1 (Medium), with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
