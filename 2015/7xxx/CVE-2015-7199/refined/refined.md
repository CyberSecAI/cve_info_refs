Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-7199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the absence of status checking within the `AddWeightedPathSegLists` and `SVGPathSegListSMILType::Interpolate` functions in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, these functions call `SetLength` on a `FallibleTArray` without verifying the success of that operation. If the `SetLength` call fails due to a low-memory condition, subsequent operations may lead to memory corruption due to a dangling or incorrect pointer reference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Status Check:** The code does not check the return value or status of the `SetLength` call, assuming it will always succeed.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Failure of `SetLength` due to low memory could result in out-of-bounds memory access or corruption when the functions attempt to write to a memory area that has not been allocated or has been deallocated.
*   **Improper Handling of Fallible Array:** The usage of a fallible array, `FallibleTArray`, without proper error checking after resize operations creates a potential for memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The memory corruption could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox, although this is considered a possibility and not confirmed in all sources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted SVG Document:** A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted SVG document.
*  **SMIL Animation:** The vulnerable functions are called during SMIL animation of path data in SVG elements. By providing a large or complex SVG, an attacker may cause a low memory condition when these functions are called during SMIL animation operations to expose a vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into opening a crafted SVG file in the browser.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `dom\svg\SVGPathSegListSMILType.cpp` file.
*  The flawed functions involved in this CVE perform operations with SVG path segments.
*  The error occurs specifically in `AddWeightedPathSegLists` where the length of the `aResult` is set without checking for memory allocation failure, resulting in the `aResult` iterator being invalidated and subsequent writes to it being out of bounds. This issue also appears in the function  `SVGPathSegListSMILType::Interpolate`.

**Additional Information from other sources**
*   The SUSE advisory indicates a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5, with the vector `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P`. This specifies network access, low complexity, no authentication, partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact, and partial availability impact.
*   The Ubuntu notice indicates that the attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.
*   The Red Hat advisory states the vulnerability could cause a crash and/or lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox. Red Hat also clarifies that this vulnerability was found through a code inspection.

In summary, CVE-2015-7199 involves a memory corruption vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox caused by missing status checks during SVG processing, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if an attacker can find a way to trigger a memory allocation failure at the correct time.
