Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to subdirectories and executable modules of SafeNet Authentication Service Agent installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insecure file system permissions: The installation folders of SafeNet Authentication Service Agents grant excessive permissions to authenticated users, allowing them to modify or substitute executable files.
*   Lack of proper permission enforcement: The system does not adequately restrict access to critical files and directories within the agent's installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Privilege escalation: A low-privileged user can modify or replace executable modules used by higher-privileged users (like administrators). When an administrator executes the modified module, the attacker gains full control over the compromised host.
*   Complete system compromise: By gaining administrator privileges, an attacker can perform malicious actions, such as installing malware, stealing sensitive data, or disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local file system manipulation: An attacker with local access to the machine can directly modify files and directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Authenticated local user: The attacker needs to have a valid account on the system, although it can be a low-privileged account (even guest accounts).
*   File system write access: The attacker requires the ability to write/modify files in the agent's installation directory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects several SafeNet Authentication Service Agents, including:
    *   Windows Logon Agent
    *   IIS Agent
    *   TokenValidator Proxy Agent
    *   Outlook Web App Agent
    *   AD FS Agent
    *   NPS Agent
    *   Remote Web Workplace Agent
    *   Citrix Web Interface Agent
    *   End User Software Tools for Windows
*   The vendor has released maintenance releases for most agents to fix the vulnerability. For some agents, a manual mitigation process is suggested. The recommended manual mitigation involves removing "Full control/modify/write permissions" for Authenticated Users, and allowing "Read & Execute only" while ensuring that Administrators group have full control permissions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in January 2016.
