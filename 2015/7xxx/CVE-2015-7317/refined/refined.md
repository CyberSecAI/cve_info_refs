Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An incorrect security declaration in Plone's Kupu WYSIWYG editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The primary vulnerability is that the misconfigured security declaration allows any authenticated user, regardless of their assigned role/permissions, to edit the settings of the Kupu editor. This allows regular users to potentially gain access to elevated privileges through manipulation of Kupu settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining the ability to edit Kupu settings, an attacker can potentially elevate their privileges within the Plone CMS. The specific actions and permissions gained would depend on the nature of the configurable settings.
- The ability to edit kupu settings could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the website through the editor settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attack vector is through the web interface and requires an attacker to be an authenticated user of the Plone system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the Plone CMS. No special privileges or elevated access are initially required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the Kupu editor's configuration settings.

**Affected Versions:**
- Plone versions 3 through 4.2 are affected.
