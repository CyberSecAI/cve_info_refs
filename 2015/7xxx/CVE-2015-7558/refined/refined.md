Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a stack exhaustion issue in librsvg2 when parsing SVG files containing circular definitions in paint servers, defined through the `xlink:href` attribute.  Specifically, the issue arises from an infinite loop during the processing of these cyclical references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Exhaustion:** The primary weakness is the potential for stack exhaustion due to the infinite loop when handling cyclic references.
- **Infinite Loop:** The lack of proper cycle detection in paint server references results in the processing code entering an infinite loop when such a cycle is present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a Denial-of-Service condition, where an application using the vulnerable librsvg2 library can crash due to stack exhaustion, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Application Crash:** Applications parsing SVG files through librsvg2 are susceptible to crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG Files:** The attack vector involves crafted SVG files containing circular definitions in their paint server references. These malicious SVGs can be delivered through various means, including websites, email attachments, or file transfers.
- **SVG Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when a vulnerable application attempts to parse a malicious SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious SVG Files:** Attackers need to be able to generate SVG files with the specific structure that causes the circular reference vulnerability.
- **Delivery of Malicious SVG:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted SVG file to a target application that utilizes the vulnerable librsvg2 library to parse SVG files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in librsvg2 version 2.40.12 by rewriting the checks for cyclic references.
- The issue affects functions such as `rsvg_cairo_pop_discrete_layer`, `rsvg_cairo_pop_render_stack`, and `rsvg_cairo_generate_mask`.
- The vulnerability was also related to and fixed in the commit <https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=a51919f7e1ca9c535390a746fbf6e28c8402dc61>
