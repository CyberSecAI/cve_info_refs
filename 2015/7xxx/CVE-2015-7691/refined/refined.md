    "description": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-9750 in NTP's ntp_crypto.c, specifically missing length checks for autokey with GQ identity scheme. The patch for CVE-2014-9750 did not fully validate the length of data within certain autokey operations.",

      "Incomplete validation of autokey data length.",
