## ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A routers contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#391604

Original Release Date: 2015-11-03 | Last Revised: 2015-11-04

---

### Overview

ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router, version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.h\_PE, and ZXV10 W300 router, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE, contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-200**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure** - CVE-2015-7248  Multiple information exposure vulnerabilities enable an attacker to obtain credentials and other sensitive details about the ZXHN H108N R1A.   1. User names and password hashes can be viewed in the page source of http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc 2. The configuration file of the device contains usernames, passwords, keys, and other values in plain text, which can be used by a user with lower privileges to gain admin account access. This issue also affects ZTE ZXV10 W300 models, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE.  [**CWE-285**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)**: Improper Authorization** - CVE-2015-7249 By default, only admin may authenticate directly with the web administration pages in the ZXHN H108N R1A. By manipulating parameters in client-side requests, an attacker may authenticate as another existing account, such as user or support, and may be able to perform actions otherwise not allowed. For instance, while authenticated as support, directly accessing http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html&var:menu=maintenance&var:page=accessctrl&var:subpage=accountpsd permits changing the password of user.[**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2015-7250The webproc cgi module of the ZXHN H108N R1A accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.[**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - CVE-2015-7251In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the Telnet service, when enabled, is accessible using the hard-coded credentials 'root' for both the username and password.[**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2015-7252In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the errorpage parameter of the webproc cgi module is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A LAN-based attacker can obtain credentials and configuration information, bypass authentication, access arbitrary files, and gain complete control of affected devices. Note that in some configurations, an external attacker may be able to leverage these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has issued ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE to address the vulnerabilities affecting ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A. Users are encouraged to contact their Internet service provider for updates.Note that W300 models are no longer officially supported and will not be receiving any updates. Users should consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Discontinue use**ZTE states:*The vulnerable W300 router was officially replaced by H108N V2.1 released in July 2014, and the vulnerable H108N was finished upgrading to version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE through operator channel that all the vulnerabilities mentioned herein were fixed. ZTE recommends users to contact local operators for upgrade service.*Since patches will not be issued to address vulnerabilities in W300 routers, users should strongly consider discontinuing use of affected devices. Users of ISP-provisioned W300 devices should request replacement routers. |

CVE-2015-7249
CVE-2015-7250
CVE-2015-7251
CVE-2015-7252

*Note*: Large deployment size, primarily in Peru, used by TdP.

Description
*CWE-200* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html>*: Information
Exposure* - CVE-2015-7248
Multiple information exposure vulnerabilities enable an attacker to obtain
credentials and other sensitive details about the ZXHN H108N R1A.
A. User names and password hashes can be viewed in the page source of
http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc

PoC:

Login Page source contents:

...snip....
//get user info
var G_UserInfo = new Array();
var m = 0;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = "admin"; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = "$1$Tsnipped/; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = "1"; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = "1"; //Index
m++;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = "user"; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = "$1$Tsnipped"; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = "2"; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = "2"; //Index
m++;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = "support"; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = "$1$Tsnipped"; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = "2"; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = "3"; //Index
m++;
...snip...

B. The configuration file of the device contains usernames, passwords,
keys, and other values in plain text, which can be used by a user with
lower privileges to gain admin account access. This issue also affects ZTE
ZXV10 W300 models, version W300V1.0.0f_ER1_PE.

*CWE-285* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html>*: Improper
Authorization* - CVE-2015-7249

By default, only admin may authenticate directly with the web
administration pages in the ZXHN H108N R1A. By manipulating parameters in
client-side requests, an attacker may authenticate as another existing
account, such as user or support, and may be able to perform actions
otherwise not allowed.

PoC 1:
1. Login page user drop-down option shows only admin only.
2. Use an intercepting proxy / Tamper Data - and intercept the Login submit
request.
3. Change the username admin to user / support and continue Login.
4. Application permits other users to log in to mgmt portal.

PoC 2:
After logging in as support, some functional options are visibly
restricted. Certain actions can still be performed by calling the url
directly. Application does not perform proper AuthZ checks.

Following poc is a change password link. It is accessible directly, though
it (correctly) is restricted to changing normal user (non-admin) password
only.

http://
<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html&var:menu=maintenance&var:page=accessctrl&var:subpage=accountpsd

Other functions / pages may also be accessible to non-privileged users.

*CWE-22* <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html>*: Improper
Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') *-
CVE-2015-7250

The webproc cgi module of the ZXHN H108N R1A accepts a getpage parameter
which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker to
read arbitrary files on the system.

Arbitrary files can be read off of the device. No authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A routers contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#391604

Original Release Date: 2015-11-03 | Last Revised: 2015-11-04

---

### Overview

ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router, version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.h\_PE, and ZXV10 W300 router, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE, contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-200**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure** - CVE-2015-7248  Multiple information exposure vulnerabilities enable an attacker to obtain credentials and other sensitive details about the ZXHN H108N R1A.   1. User names and password hashes can be viewed in the page source of http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc 2. The configuration file of the device contains usernames, passwords, keys, and other values in plain text, which can be used by a user with lower privileges to gain admin account access. This issue also affects ZTE ZXV10 W300 models, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE.  [**CWE-285**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)**: Improper Authorization** - CVE-2015-7249 By default, only admin may authenticate directly with the web administration pages in the ZXHN H108N R1A. By manipulating parameters in client-side requests, an attacker may authenticate as another existing account, such as user or support, and may be able to perform actions otherwise not allowed. For instance, while authenticated as support, directly accessing http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html&var:menu=maintenance&var:page=accessctrl&var:subpage=accountpsd permits changing the password of user.[**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2015-7250The webproc cgi module of the ZXHN H108N R1A accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.[**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - CVE-2015-7251In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the Telnet service, when enabled, is accessible using the hard-coded credentials 'root' for both the username and password.[**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2015-7252In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the errorpage parameter of the webproc cgi module is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A LAN-based attacker can obtain credentials and configuration information, bypass authentication, access arbitrary files, and gain complete control of affected devices. Note that in some configurations, an external attacker may be able to leverage these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has issued ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE to address the vulnerabilities affecting ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A. Users are encouraged to contact their Internet service provider for updates.Note that W300 models are no longer officially supported and will not be receiving any updates. Users should consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Discontinue use**ZTE states:*The vulnerable W300 router was officially replaced by H108N V2.1 released in July 2014, and the vulnerable H108N was finished upgrading to version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE through operator channel that all the vulnerabilities mentioned herein were fixed. ZTE recommends users to contact local operators for upgrade service.*Since patches will not be issued to address vulnerabilities in W300 routers, users should strongly consider discontinuing use of affected devices. Users of ISP-provisioned W300 devices should request replacement routers. |
