Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper authorization checks** in the web administration interface of the ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The web interface does not properly enforce access controls. While the login page only displays "admin" as a selectable user, it's possible to modify the client-side login request to authenticate as other existing accounts, such as "user" or "support."
*   After logging in as a lower privileged user, the web application doesn't perform proper authorization checks, allowing access to restricted pages and functionalities by directly crafting and accessing specific URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass the intended authentication mechanism and gain access to the router's management interface using a lower-privileged account.
*   This allows attackers to perform actions not otherwise allowed. For instance, an attacker could change the "user" password while authenticated as "support" by directly accessing specific URL, which leads to unauthorized modification of user settings.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed via the router's web interface.
*   **Client-side request manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate parameters in the HTTP login request. Specifically, the username parameter.
*   **Direct URL access:** After logging in with a lower privileged account, the attacker can bypass authorization checks by accessing restricted URLs directly.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **LAN Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the router's web administration interface, typically within the local network.
*   **Web proxy/Interception Tools:** The attacker requires the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, such as an intercepting proxy or browser extension.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable URLs:** The attacker needs knowledge of the router's web interface structure and the URLs of privileged pages in order to perform unauthorized actions.
