Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `decodenetnum()` function in NTP. This function is responsible for decoding network numbers from incoming packets.
- The core issue is that `decodenetnum()` doesn't properly handle unusually long data values where a network address is expected, specifically within mode 6 or mode 7 packets. Instead of returning a failure, it triggers an assertion failure, leading to a crash of the `ntpd` process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The function does not adequately validate the length of the input data.
- **Assertion Failure:** Instead of graceful error handling, the code uses an `ASSERT` statement, causing the program to terminate unexpectedly when encountering invalid input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, achieved by causing the `ntpd` process to crash. This would prevent time synchronization, affecting systems relying on accurate timekeeping.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Mode 6 or Mode 7 Packets:** An attacker sends a specially crafted NTP packet to the target system.
- **Unusually Long Data Value:** The malicious packet contains a long, unexpected data value in the network address field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the target system.
- **Mode 6 or 7 Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send mode 6 or 7 packets to the vulnerable NTP server.
- **Authentication (in some contexts):** While some sources mention 'authenticated attacker', it appears that the vulnerability can be triggered without authentication depending on the configuration of ntpd (e.g. mode 7 is disabled by default). However, restrict noquery can also be used to limit access to mode 6 and 7 requests.
- **Knowledge of NTP protocol:** The attacker needs knowledge of the NTP protocol to create malicious packets.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all `ntp-4` releases up to, but not including `4.2.8p4`, and `4.3.0` up to, but not including `4.3.77`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by John D “Doug” Birdwell with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA.org).
- The issue was resolved in `ntp-4.2.8p4` and `4.3.77`.
- Mitigation includes implementing BCP-38 filtering, upgrading to the patched versions, and limiting access to mode 6 and 7 using `restrict noquery` or authentication.
