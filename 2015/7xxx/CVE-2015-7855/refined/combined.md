NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

#### Description

If `ntpd` is fed a crafted mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an unusually long data value where a network address is expected, the `decodenetnum()` function will abort with an assertion failure instead of simply returning a failure condition.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page).
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you are unable to upgrade:
  + mode 7 is disabled by default. Don’t enable it.
  + Use `restrict noquery` to limit who can send mode 6 and mode 7 requests.
  + Configure and use the `controlkey` and `requestkey` authentication directives to limit who can send mode 6 and mode 7 requests.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-5219

The ULOGTOD function in ntp.d in SNTP before 4.2.7p366 does not properly perform type conversions
from a precision value to a double, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (inﬁnite
loop) via a crafted NTP packet.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-1548

An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the
peer->dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch, the client in NTP 4.2.8p4 and
earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate
server responses.

* **Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast, Improper Input Validation, Improper Authentication, Security Features, Null Pointer Dereference, Data Processing Errors, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Race Condition

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Siemens products TIM 4R-IE communication modules are affected:

* TIM 4R-IE (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions
* TIM 4R-IE DNP3 (incl. SIPLUS NET variants): All versions

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [INCORRECT TYPE CONVERSION OR CAST CWE-704](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/704.html)

The ULOGTOD function in ntp.d in SNTP before 4.2.7p366 does not properly perform type conversions from a precision value to a double, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted NTP packet.

[CVE-2015-5219](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5219) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Deactivate NTP-based time synchronization of the device, if enabled. The feature is disabled by default.
* Configure an additional firewall to prevent communication to the Port UDP/123 of an affected device.
* Migrate to a successor product.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-497656](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-497656.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1274264#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 11:32:33 UTC  ``` It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.  External References:  <https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/blob/stable/NEWS#L295> <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#October_2015_NTP_Security_Vulner>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1274264#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-23 09:10:23 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/commit/ba716a464ecb20618560075f2e4e1051e5b6f24f>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1274264#c5)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-06 13:54:04 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1296162](show_bug.cgi?id=1296162 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2015-7855 ntp: ASSERT in decodenetnum() on invalid values [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1274264#c7)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-07 13:22:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 as they do not include support for the mrulist feature, which exposes the decodenetnum() function.   ``` |  |
