Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when constructing the command to be executed by the `exec()` function. The `cool-video-gallery` plugin uses user-provided data (`$video->filename`, `$video->alttext`, `$video_input`) within a command string that's passed to the shell via `exec()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the command injection vulnerability in the `cool-video-gallery/lib/core.php` file, specifically around lines 709-714. The code constructs a shell command using user-provided data without any sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the string and have them executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the same privileges as the web server process. This can lead to a full compromise of the server, including data theft, malware installation, and defacement.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker could gain complete control of the system, potentially installing backdoors or causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Provided Input:** The attack vector is through manipulating user-provided input, particularly:
    *   `$video->filename` (when `$video->video_type` is not equal to `$cool_video_gallery->video_type_media`)
    *   `$video->alttext` which contributes to `$new_target_file` via `$new_target_filename`
   *   `$video_input` (when `$video->video_type` is equal to `$cool_video_gallery->video_type_media`)
*   **FFMPEG Command Injection:** The vulnerable code constructs an FFMPEG command with un-sanitized user input, allowing for command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Access:** The attacker would need some level of access to the WordPress site to manipulate video upload or edit functionality. This could be through a compromised administrator account or through vulnerabilities in other plugins that allow them to control the input passed into the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Understanding of Plugin:** The attacker needs some understanding of how the plugin stores video metadata and generates thumbnail images.
*   **Knowledge of FFMPEG:** A basic understanding of how FFMPEG works and how it can be manipulated for command injection.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `cool-video-gallery/lib/core.php`, lines 703-714.
*   The vulnerable code constructs the command using `$options['cvg_ffmpegpath']` and user-supplied parameters such as `$video->filename`, `$video_input`, and `$video->alttext`.
*   The `exec()` function is used to execute the constructed command.
*   The vulnerable plugin was closed in June 28, 2019 due to this security issue.
*   The vendor was notified on 2015-11-30.
