{
  "CVE-2015-7203": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow exists in the DirectWriteFontInfo::LoadFontFamilyData function within gfx/thebes/gfxDWriteFontList.cpp. This occurs when allocating memory for a font family name, specifically when handling out-of-memory (OOM) conditions with a crafted font-family name.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow: The code does not properly check the result of the fallible SetLength function, which can lead to an attempt to write beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer if an out-of-memory condition occurs during the allocation of memory for font family name. This is because the `memcpy` operation will occur even if `famName` has not had memory properly allocated, leading to a write to an invalid memory location.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability by tricking users into opening a specially crafted website which results in a buffer overflow. This could potentially lead to a denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted website that triggers the vulnerable code path. This involves loading a crafted font family name that causes an OOM during allocation.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to trick the user into opening a malicious website that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker needs to control the font family name being processed."
