Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7872:

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-7872 describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's keyring subsystem, specifically in how it garbage collects uninstantiated keyrings. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged attacker to trigger a kernel crash (denial of service) and potentially escalate privileges.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `key_gc_unused_keys` function within the `security/keys/gc.c` file. 
- When `request_key()` or `keyctl request2` is used to request a keyring and the upcall fails, the `keyring->type_data.reject_error` field is set to an error code like -ENOKEY.
- During garbage collection, the `keyring_destroy()` function attempts to use `list_empty()` on `keyring->type_data.link`, which is actually a union with `reject_error`. This causes the kernel to try to dereference the error code as a pointer leading to a kernel crash/oops.
- The issue is that the `key->type->destroy()` function was being called unconditionally even if the key was not successfully instantiated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of uninstantiated keyrings during garbage collection.
- Use of a union field for both error codes and list pointers without checking the current state of the key.
- Unconditional call to the key destroy function

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user can trigger a kernel panic, causing the system to crash.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** As mentioned in the Red Hat bugzilla entry, there is potential for a local attacker to escalate their privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- Attacker must be a local user on the system.
- The attack is triggered by using crafted `keyctl` commands to request a keyring and force an upcall failure, followed by garbage collection of the failed key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to execute commands including keyctl
- No special privileges required
- A method to force an upcall failure while requesting keyrings.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability's root cause and how it can be triggered using a specific sequence of `keyctl` commands. It also links to the upstream patch and mentions that the vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and MRG 2.
*   **Upstream Patch:** The upstream patch (ce1fad2740c648a4340f6f6c391a8a83769d2e8c) modifies the `security/keys/gc.c` and `security/keys/request_key.c` files. The patch prevents the crash by ensuring that the key destruction method is only called on instantiated keyrings, and it does not allow request_key() to create new keyrings
*   **SUSE Security Advisory:** Indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in a SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching update, implying a live kernel fix was issued for this. It also provides a list of fixed packages for various SUSE products.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice:** Indicates a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's keyring handler that allows a local, unprivileged attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Mitigations:**

- Apply the provided upstream patch.
- Update affected Linux distributions to versions containing the fix.
- Apply patches provided in official security advisories of vendors
