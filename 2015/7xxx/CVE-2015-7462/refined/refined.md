- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mqcertck` tool, introduced in IBM WebSphere MQ 8.0.0.4, could trace certificate keystore passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (keystore passwords) through tracing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the trace could potentially gain access to the keystore, potentially compromising the security of the MQ system.
- **Attack vectors:** Enabling MQ trace while running the `mqcertck` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to enable MQ tracing.
