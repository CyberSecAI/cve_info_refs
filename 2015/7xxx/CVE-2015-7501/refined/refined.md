  "CVE-2015-7501": {
    "description": "It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted code execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the commons-collections library.",
    "root_cause": "The Apache commons-collections library permitted code execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed chain of classes.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data leading to remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the commons-collections library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Deserialization of a specially crafted object chain"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted serialized object to a vulnerable application using the commons-collections library."
