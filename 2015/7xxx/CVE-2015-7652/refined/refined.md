Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7652:

**Root Cause:**
  - The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in Adobe Flash Player related to the `gridFitType` property of the `TextField` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Use-after-free: A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Flash Player process. This could lead to system compromise.
  - Denial of Service: The vulnerability could potentially cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
  - Disclosure of sensitive information: It is mentioned that the vulnerabilities could also potentially disclose sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted SWF file embedded on a webpage or opened locally.
  - User interaction: User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious SWF file.
  - The attacker needs to lure a victim into opening this malicious SWF file, either via a web page or as a local file.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `TextField.gridFitType` setter is vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `gridFitType` property is set to an object with a `toString()` method that causes the `TextField` object to be freed.
*   After the `TextField` object is freed, the setter attempts to write to the freed memory location, causing the use-after-free.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources mention that this vulnerability is addressed in Adobe Flash Player versions 18.0.0.261, 19.0.0.245 and 11.2.202.548.

*   The CVSS score is 9.3 as assigned by the National Vulnerability Database and 6.8 by ZDI
*   The Exploit-DB entry includes a proof-of-concept ActionScript code demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
