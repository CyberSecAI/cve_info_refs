Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authorization bypass in the "Send as attachment" feature of MOVEit. By manipulating requests, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to arbitrary files and documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce authorization controls when using the "Send as attachment" feature.
- **Lack of File Access Controls:**  The system does not prevent a user with a valid `FileID` from accessing files they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can access any file or document uploaded to the system without proper authorization.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information stored within the files can be exposed, potentially leading to data breaches and reputational damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting specific HTTP POST requests to the `/mobile/sendMsg` (mobile application) or `/human.aspx` (web application) endpoints.
- **FileID Manipulation:** The attacker needs to know or obtain a valid FileID (which, according to the advisory, can be obtained through CVE-2015-7677).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the MOVEit system.
- **Knowledge of FileID:** The attacker needs to know the `FileID` of the file they want to access. This can be obtained by exploiting CVE-2015-7677.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MOVEit server.

**Technical Details:**
- The advisory provides example POST requests for both the mobile and web application interfaces, highlighting the vulnerable parameters (`serverFileIds` in mobile and `arg02`/`arg06` in web app, referring to `FileID` values) and the required structure of the requests.

**Affected Versions:**
- MOVEit DMZ v8.1 and below
- MOVEit Mobile (v1.2.0.962)

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory explicitly states that the exploit requires a valid user session.
- The CVSS score is 6.5 (Medium), with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, which confirms the network attack vector, low complexity, low privileges, no user interaction and high confidentiality impact.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through both web and mobile interfaces.
- The advisory provides a timeline of the disclosure process with vendor notification, confirmation, patch release, and public disclosure dates.
