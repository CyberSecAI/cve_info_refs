| [Description](#c0)  a9101556    2002-02-04 10:51:03 UTC  ``` Lately the env-update process was augmented to generate /etc/csh.csh and /etc/csh.env for csh/tcsh users. There the variable $path (lowecase!) is set to some hardwired dirs in /etc/csh.csh + some things in /etc/csh.env. But unfortunately the latter uses bash-style syntax, i.e. colon separating the single dirs instead of c-style (separation by spaces). Since env-update is run after every merge manual editing of /etc/csh.env is no permanent fix. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Geert Bevin    2002-02-04 17:18:14 UTC  ``` From the tcsh man pages :  setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.  Also when logging into csh as a login shell it seems to resolve all paths correctly and finds all executables within them. Marking as INVALID ``` |  |

# Oracle JRE/JDK: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Oracle's JRE and JDK
software suites allowing remote attackers to remotely execute arbitrary
code, obtain information, and cause Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/oracle-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.0.72** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.0.72** |

| Package | **dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.0.72** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.0.72** |

### Background

Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) lets you develop and deploy
Java applications on desktops and servers, as well as in today’s
demanding embedded environments. Java offers the rich user interface,
performance, versatility, portability, and security that today’s
applications require.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in both Oracle’s JRE and JDK. Please
review the referenced CVE’s for additional information.

### Impact

Remote attackers could gain access to information, remotely execute
arbitrary code, and cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Oracle JRE Users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=dev-java/oracle-jre-bin-1.8.0.72"

```

All Oracle JDK Users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin-1.8.0.72"

```
