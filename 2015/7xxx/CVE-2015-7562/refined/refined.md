Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7562:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the "label" value of an item is displayed using `stripslashes()`, which does not adequately prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, the name of a role is not properly sanitized, leading to XSS when displayed in admin pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within the "label" field of an item and the name of a role, which is then executed when the item or role is viewed by other users or admins.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Modify the content of the page
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim
    - Trick an admin to trigger the XSS by sharing malicious items.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious script when creating or editing an item's "label".
- The attacker can inject malicious script when creating a new role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user authorized to create/modify items or roles within the TeamPass application.
- No special privileges are needed, just the capability of adding or editing the vulnerable fields.
