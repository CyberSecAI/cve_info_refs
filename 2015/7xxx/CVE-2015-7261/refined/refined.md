The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7261.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of hard-coded credentials within the QNAP iArtist Lite application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-798:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials. The iArtist Lite application contains a hard-coded FTP account and password.
- **CWE-523:** Unprotected Transport of Credentials. The hard-coded credentials are used to communicate with Signage Station via FTP, which transmits all data in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on network traffic and obtain the hardcoded credentials, gaining access to the Signage Station server and potentially being able to perform other attacks using other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic to intercept the hard-coded FTP credentials used by iArtist Lite to communicate with Signage Station.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic between iArtist Lite and Signage Station, and then use the intercepted credentials to access the Signage Station.
