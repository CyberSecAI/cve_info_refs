  "CVE-2015-7803": {
    "description": "The phar_get_entry_data function in ext/phar/util.c in PHP before 5.5.30 and 5.6.x before 5.6.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a .phar file with a crafted TAR archive entry in which the Link indicator references a file that does not exist.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `phar_get_fp_offset` function when processing TAR archives with a link indicator that points to a non-existent file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the PHP application.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted .phar file with a malformed TAR archive.",

    "description": "Off-by-one error in the phar\_parse\_zipfile function in ext/phar/zip.c in PHP before 5.5.30 and 5.6.x before 5.6.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and application crash) by including the / filename in a .zip PHAR archive.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the phar extension processes zip archive entries with a filename of '/'. It leads to an uninitialized pointer dereference.",
