Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in the way TLS CBC ciphersuites were handled in the Botan library. Specifically, a length check on packet fields would trigger a different alert type upon failure than the one used for message authentication failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Padding Oracle:** The different alert responses based on the length check created a padding oracle. This oracle could be exploited to leak information about the padding bytes of an encrypted message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of Data:** By iteratively querying the oracle, an attacker can decrypt the ciphertext. This is especially dangerous in scenarios where sensitive information is being transported over TLS.
*   **Vulnerability of HTTP Servers:** The documentation notes that HTTP servers are particularly vulnerable due to the predictable nature of some HTTP headers and content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attack vector is network-based, with the attacker needing to send specially crafted TLS packets to the vulnerable server.
*   **TLS CBC Ciphersuites:** Only TLS connections using CBC ciphersuites are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker needs knowledge of the TLS protocol and how CBC padding works to craft the exploit packets.
*   **Guessing of Plaintext:** The provided text states the attacker would initially need to guess some bytes of plaintext, which can be easier in certain protocol scenarios, such as HTTP, where content may be somewhat predictable.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was introduced in Botan version 1.11.0 and fixed in 1.11.22.
* Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates that versions 1.8.x and 1.10.x of Botan, used in Fedora/EPEL are not affected.
