Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking within several functions of `mDNSResponder`:
    - `GetValueForIPv4Addr()`
    - `GetValueForMACAddr()`
    - `rfc3110_import()`
    - `CopyNSEC3ResourceRecord()`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-120:** Classic buffer overflow. The lack of proper bounds checking allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer boundaries when handling specific input. This could lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A remote attacker could potentially read or write to arbitrary memory locations on the affected system.
- This could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, crashing the affected service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based attacks are possible due to mDNSResponder being a network service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to a vulnerable mDNSResponder service.
- No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.
-  The complexity is rated as medium, but as it is exploitable remotely it is still critical to patch it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#143335 groups CVE-2015-7987 with CVE-2015-7988, a null pointer dereference vulnerability in `handle_regservice_request()`. However, only the information for CVE-2015-7987 is considered for this response, based on the request.
- Affected software includes Apple products, and potentially other third-party products using mDNSResponder.
- The vulnerability affects mDNSResponder versions 379.27 and above, prior to 625.41.2.
- Patches are available from Apple and other vendors for affected software.
