Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how CMAP (Character Map) tables are parsed within Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. A specially crafted CMAP table can cause the application to read memory beyond the bounds of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability during the parsing of CMAP tables.
- Memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted CMAP table.
- Visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver or trick the victim into opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious website.
- Ability to craft a malicious CMAP table.
