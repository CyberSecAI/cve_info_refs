Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-7185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by Firefox for Android not ensuring the address bar is restored upon exiting fullscreen mode. This occurs when a tab switches due to an alert, while another tab was in fullscreen mode. When returning from fullscreen mode, the address bar fails to reappear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper state management:** The application does not correctly track or restore the visibility state of the address bar after switching tabs while in fullscreen mode.
-   **Missing Security Check:** The browser allows a tab switch due to `window.alert` or DOMWillOpenModalDialog event, without ensuring the address bar is restored properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Address Bar Spoofing:**  An attacker can create a fake address bar using HTML/JavaScript, leading the user to believe they are on a legitimate page, thus facilitating phishing or other deceptive attacks.
-   **Potential for Unusable Browser:** In some cases, the entire browser can become unresponsive, requiring the user to manually kill the app.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **JavaScript Code:** Malicious JavaScript code on a webpage triggers the vulnerability.
-   **Tab Switching:** An alert() or the DOMWillOpenModalDialog event on a different tab forces the browser to switch back to the original tab from fullscreen, without proper restoration of the address bar.
-   **Fullscreen Mode:** The vulnerability is triggered by first entering fullscreen mode on one tab, and the tab switching via alert on another tab and forcing the switch from fullscreen

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious webpage, which would need to be visited by the victim.
-   **User interaction**: user needs to visit the malicious webpage and then click on one of the triggers which are: an alert() on another tab, which forces the tab switch.
