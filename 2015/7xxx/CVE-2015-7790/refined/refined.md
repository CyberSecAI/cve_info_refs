Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the ASUS WL-330NUL portable wireless LAN router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored on the device and executed when a user views the affected content. This is categorized as CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's web browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Data theft
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user must access a page or application within the vulnerable device where the injected malicious code is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges are required:**  The attacker does not need any specific authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the device, which likely occurs through some user-facing input.
- The attacker also requires the victim to then access the web page or application containing the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Product:** ASUS WL-330NUL portable wireless LAN router.
- **Affected Firmware Versions:** Firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.42 are vulnerable.
- **CVSS Scores:**
    - CVSS v3: 6.1 (Medium)
    - CVSS v2: 4.3 (Medium)
