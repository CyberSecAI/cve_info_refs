Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flawed URL checking method in Plone. Specifically, the `isURLInPortal` function did not properly sanitize URLs, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Non-Persistent XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent XSS issue. This means that the malicious script is not stored on the server, but rather injected through a crafted URL and executed in the user's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `isURLInPortal` function lacked proper sanitization of URL inputs, specifically when checking if a given URL is within the Plone site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL that is processed by the vulnerable `isURLInPortal` function. This allows the attacker to potentially:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface web pages.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector is through the use of specially crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker can inject XSS payload into a URL that is validated using the vulnerable method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs that include malicious JavaScript.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** The user needs to click on the manipulated URL for the attack to be effective. It may involve a link being sent to the user, or the URL being injected into the application in a way that it is processed by the vulnerable code.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code checks for the presence of `<script`, `%3Cscript`, `javascript:`, and `javascript%3A` strings in the URL as a form of sanitization, this check is insufficient to prevent all XSS attack variants.
- The fix involved adding these checks to the `isURLInPortal` function:
 ```python
 if ('<script' in url or '%3Cscript' in url or 'javascript:' in url or
     'javascript%3A' in url):
      return False
 ```
- This commit ([https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/commit/3da710a2cd68587f0bf34f2e7ea1167d6eeee087](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/commit/3da710a2cd68587f0bf34f2e7ea1167d6eeee087)) addresses this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Plone 3.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x, < 4.3.7, and < 5.0rc1

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix is available as `Products.PloneHotfix20150910`.
- The CVE assignment team at MITRE noted that future URL substring restrictions added to address other XSS attack vectors would not be within the scope of this CVE.
