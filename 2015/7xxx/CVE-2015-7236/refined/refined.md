Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the `rpcbind` service when handling `PMAP_CALLIT` requests, specifically within the `xprt_set_caller` function and the `svc_dodestroy` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. A `netbuf` structure, which contains a pointer to a buffer holding the address, is copied directly. This results in two `netbuf` structures referencing the same shared address buffer. When one of these structures is freed, the other's pointer becomes invalid, leading to a use-after-free. Specifically, after a `PMAP_CALLIT` request, the `caller_addr` is freed, but the `xp_rtaddr` in the transport structure retains a dangling pointer to the freed memory.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The dangling pointer in `xp_rtaddr` is later reused, corrupting the memory with a new sockaddr_in address. This can overwrite data in unpredictable locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service.  The use-after-free leads to a crash of the `rpcbind` daemon, making RPC services unavailable.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources mention that the vulnerability *could possibly* lead to arbitrary code execution, although this is not the primary reported impact. The use-after-free and subsequent memory corruption could be leveraged under specific circumstances to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the network by sending specially crafted packets to the `rpcbind` daemon. The specific trigger involves a `PMAP_CALLIT` request coming in via IPv4 UDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker needs network access to the target system running `rpcbind`.
*   **Ability to Send RPC Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send `PMAP_CALLIT` requests to the `rpcbind` daemon to trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

1.  A `PMAP_CALLIT` call arrives via IPv4 UDP.
2.  `rpcbind` duplicates the caller's address to a `netbuf` and stores it in `FINFO[0].caller_addr`. The `caller_addr->buf` now points to memory region A.
3.  `rpcbind` forwards the call and receives a reply.
4.  In `xprt_set_caller`, it copies `FINFO[0].caller_addr` to `xprt->xp_rtaddr`, without properly copying the buffer and sharing the same pointer `xp_rtaddr.buf` now refers to the same memory region A.
5. The netbuf `caller_addr` and `caller_addr.buf` are freed, but `xp_rtaddr.buf` still points to the freed region A.
6.  A subsequent call on the same UDP socket overwrites the freed region A (accessed through `xp_rtaddr.buf`) with the new caller's address, corrupting memory.
7.  A later TCP connection is accepted which might allocate its SVCXPRT over the freed memory region A.  If another UDP call occurs and overwrites the TCP client address and the TCP client disconnects leading to a crash in `svc_destroy`, when the `xp_netid` pointer is freed.
8.  The fix involves using `__rpc_set_netbuf` to properly copy the caller's address to `xprt->xp_rtaddr`, rather than just overwriting the `netbuf` structure.

**Additional Notes:**
* Multiple sources mention that the vulnerability is a use-after-free in rpcbind when freeing a corrupted `xprt->xp_netid` pointer during the `svc_dodestroy` function.
* The provided patch is located in `src/rpcb_svc_com.c` and the fix involves calling `__rpc_set_netbuf` in `xprt_set_caller` instead of direct copying the `netbuf` structure to make a deep copy of the address.
* The vulnerability affects multiple operating systems including FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, and Gentoo.
