Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7179:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The provided text includes the following information which maps to CVE-2015-7179:

*   **Description**: "The `VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace` function in libGLES in ANGLE, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 on Windows, incorrectly allocates memory for shader attribute arrays, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via crafted (1) OpenGL or (2) WebGL content."
*   **Bugzilla**: Mentions of bug 1190526 in multiple resources, which is identified as relating to `CVE-2015-7179`.
*   **Affected versions**: Specifies Firefox versions before 41.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.3 as being affected.

Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2015-7179.

**2. Extracted Information**

*   **Root Cause**: Integer overflow in `VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace` function in the ANGLE graphics library (libGLES), specifically when allocating memory for shader attribute arrays. This occurs when the reserved space is rounded up to a 16-byte boundary, which can result in a zero or very small allocation size due to the integer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Integer Overflow**: The `roundUp()` operation after adding the required space to `mReservedSpace` can cause an integer overflow, effectively reducing the reserved space to 0 or small values.
    *   **Buffer Overflow**: When `VertexBufferInterface::storeVertexAttributes` is called to copy the attribute array into a buffer, if the buffer is undersized due to integer overflow, then data is written past the boundary of the allocated buffer, leading to a memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Memory corruption leading to application crash.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)**: Exploitable crash due to memory corruption, allowing for potential arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Information Disclosure**: When the memory corruption results in accessing unowned memory, information disclosure can potentially happen.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Crafted WebGL or OpenGL content. The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted sequence of shader attribute arrays.
    *   Specifically through crafted Javascript code, which manipulates the vertices.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Remote attacker via network or compromised website (for browsers).
    *   Ability to provide WebGL/OpenGL content through a website or other vector.
    *   The vulnerability is specific to Windows.

**Additional Technical Details**
* The vulnerable function `VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace` calculates the required space for vertex data but fails to properly account for rounding up to 16-byte boundaries after incrementing the reserved space. Specifically, it uses the `roundUp()` function after incrementing the `mReservedSpace` variable. If large allocations are made, the value overflows to a small value, then a small buffer is allocated and overflows during data copy.
* The `StreamingVertexBufferInterface::reserveSpace` function checks if the new requested buffer size is larger than the current one. However if the allocated buffer size is zero (due to overflow), then this function leaves the previously allocated default buffer of length `0x100000` bytes as is. This leads to the buffer overflow as the memory copy is called.
* The proof of concept consists of shader code with multiple attribute arrays of a large size that triggers this overflow.

**Mitigation**
*   The patch involves adding an additional check that confirms if the addition of `alignedSpaceRequired` and `mWritePosition` would be safe by calling `IsUnsignedAdditionSafe()` (before the increment) and also checking if the aligned size is greater than the required size.  This is followed by the increment.
