- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from storing CMA user's usernames and passwords in plaintext during the CMA installation process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive user credentials in plaintext, which makes them easily accessible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user on the CMA install machine can obtain other CMA user's usernames and passwords in plaintext, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user with access to the CMA install machine can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where IBM Capacity Management Analytics is being installed.
