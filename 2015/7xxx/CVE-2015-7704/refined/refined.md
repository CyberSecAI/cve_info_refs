  "CVE-2015-7704": {
    "description": "When ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.",
    "root_cause": "ntpd client does not validate the originate timestamp in a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet against the transmit timestamp of its original request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of timestamps in KoD packets"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service by disabling time synchronization. An attacker can increase the client's polling interval, preventing it from synchronizing with the NTP server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Off-path attack using spoofed KoD packets"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to spoof packets from the target's NTP server, and also determine the server the client is using for synchronization (can be done by querying the client for time and analyzing the reply)."
