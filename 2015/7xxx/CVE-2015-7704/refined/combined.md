| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:28:38 UTC  ``` When ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.  This issue affects ntp versions 4.2.6 and 4.2.8 up to 4.2.8p3.  The attacker can find out to what server the client is currently synchronized by sending it a regular client mode packet and checking the refid field in the reply (the refid is IPv4 address or first four bytes of MD5 sum of IPv6 address).  Upstream bug:  <http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2901>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:30:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082270](attachment.cgi?id=1082270 "CVE-2015-7704 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082270&action=edit "CVE-2015-7704 patch") [CVE-2015-7704](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-7704) patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-10-15 14:50:10 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of ntp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, as they do not include support for KoD packets.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c6)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:36:57 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c7)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:38:45 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274165](show_bug.cgi?id=1274165 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-7704 CVE-2015-5300 ntp: two flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 09:52:30 UTC  ``` The upstream patch for this issue (included in upstream version 4.2.8p4) is incomplete, as described in:  <https://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/pool/2015-October/007631.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:08 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

## NTP.org ntpd contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#718152

Original Release Date: 2016-04-27 | Last Revised: 2016-04-28

---

### Overview

The NTP.org reference implementation of ntpd contains multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| NTP.org's reference implementation of NTP server, ntpd, contains multiple vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay -** CVE-2015-7973An attacker on the network can record and replay authenticated broadcast mode packets. Also known as the "Deja Vu" attack.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7974A missing key check allows impersonation between authenticated peers. Also known as the "Skeleton Key" attack.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7975The nextvar() function does not properly validate length.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7976ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in filenames[**CWE-476**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)**: NULL Pointer Dereference -** CVE-2015-7977reslist NULL pointer dereference[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2015-7978Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction list[**CWE-821**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/821.html)**: Incorrect Synchronization -** CVE-2015-7979Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast and other pre-emptable modes[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-8138Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass[**CWE-200**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure -** CVE-2015-8139Network Time Protocol ntpq and ntpdc Origin Timestamp Disclosure Vulnerability<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2946>[**CWE-294**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/294.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay -** CVE-2015-8140Network Time Protocol ntpq Control Protocol Replay Vulnerability<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2947>[**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') -** CVE-2015-8158Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/NtpBug2948>[**CWE-821**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/821.html)**: Incorrect Synchronization -** CVE-2016-1547An off-path attacker can deny service to ntpd clients by demobilizing preemptable associations using spoofed crypto-NAK packets. This vulnerability involves different code paths than those used by CVE-2015-7979.[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2016-1548By spoofing packets from a legitimate server, an attacker can change the time of an ntpd client or deny service to an ntpd client by forcing it to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved symmetric mode.[**CWE-362**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/362.html)**: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') -** CVE-2016-1549ntpd does not prevent Sybil attacks from authenticated peers. An malicious authenticated peer can create any number of ephemeral associations in order to win ntpd's clock selection algorithm and modify a victim's clock.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-1550ntpd does not use a constant-time memory comparison function when validating the authentication digest on incoming packets. In some situations this may allow an attacker to conduct a timing attack to compute the value of the valid authentication digest causing forged packets to be accepted by ntpd.[**CWE-290**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html)**: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing -** CVE-2016-1551ntpd does not filter IPv4 bogon packets received from the network. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to spoof refclock packets to ntpd processes on systems that do not implement bogon filtering.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2016-2516, CVE-2016-2517Duplicate IPs on unconfig directives will cause an assertion botch in ntpd. A regression caused by the patch for CVE-2016-2516 was fixed and identified as CVE-2016-2517.[**CWE-125**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)**: Out-of-bounds Read -** CVE-2016-2518Using a crafted packet to create a peer association with hmode > 7 causes the MATCH\_ASSOC() lookup to make an out-of-bounds reference.[**CWE-119**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer -** CVE-2016-2519ntpq and ntpdc can be used to store and retrieve information in ntpd. It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl\_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl\_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl\_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is "too large", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7704**,** CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's [April 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security) as well as the [January 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit). |

### Impact

| Unauthenticated remote attackers may be able to spoof packets to cause denial of service, authentication bypass on commands, or certain configuration changes. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's [April 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security) as well as the [January 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit). |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Partial patches for some of these issues were initially released in January 2016 as version 4.2.8p6. Complete patches for all of these issues are now available in version [4.2.8p7](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html), released 2016-04-26. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c0)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-24 20:20:28 UTC  ``` 4.2.6p5 and 4.2.8p2/3 clients have been observed to honor any received KoD with the source address of a sys.peer, even when the packet contains an origin timestamp that does not match the one in the client's chime request. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:47:47 UTC  ``` No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c2)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:49:22 UTC  ``` I also don't think this is a security issue. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c3)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-26 00:22:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)) > No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps > are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem > it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing?  The observations aren't mine, but the problem is that the implementation is honoring, in client mode, KoDs it receives even if they don't match the chime request.  Validating that the KoD matches the original request helps to mitigate a possible attack where an attacker spoofs KoDs from a clients upstream servers, and by walking the refIDs (at least for v4), successfully denies time service to that client (or worse, steers it towards one hostile upstream server.)  > I also don't think this is a security issue.  Unfortunately in a world where BCP38 compliance is far from universal, it's possible to knock a client offline using only a few spoofed packets.    Validating the origin timestamp returned to us matches the one sent is low cost and would help to up the bar on these sorts of attacks. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2015-08-26 05:10:20 UTC  ``` There are clearly problems with any choice here.  Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from good servers.  I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was similarly authenticated.  There are potential problems no matter what we do here.  There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.  We need to let folks make local policy choices. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c5)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 03:18:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)) > There are clearly problems with any choice here. >  > Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by > sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and > then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from > good servers. >   Well not really. If you are properly set up you get multiple packets from different servers and it's extremely hard for an attacker to do this to all of them. In any case, for DENY or RSTR codes the recipient of a kiss code packet is required to drop the association. For RATE it needs to reduce the frequency of queries.   For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet. The values of the timestamps cannot be used. I've had discussions with Dave Mills on some of this and it is clear that this is the design of the kiss codes. Under NO circumstances can the contents of the packets be used so even if there was a DOS attack these packets could not be used for anything to set the clock.  The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more important and required than possible attack vectors.   > I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is > authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was > similarly authenticated. >   It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.   > There are potential problems no matter what we do here. >  > There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.

Any change would be detrimental to real live and busy systems. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c6)  Majdi S.

It turns out it's not that hard, at least in an IPv4 world where we helpfully place the IP address of the server in the refid field. For v6, provided the server is not publicly listed anywhere the truncated hash protects it to some degree.  For public servers it's not hard to pre-compute a table of hash entries, limiting the number of possible v6 addresses to source an attack from.  > For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet.

Under NO > circumstances can the contents of the packets be used so even if there was a > DOS attack these packets could not be used for anything to set the clock.          This has nothing to do with setting the clock; it has to do with validating that a KoD received actually came from our associated server, and wasn't spoofed.  Since the origin TS comes from the client, using it is not providing time service -- it just gives the client a way to  validate bidirectional communication with the server.  > The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers > (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more > important and required than possible attack vectors.          At this point the biggest worry is going to be selective denial of service attacks by spoofing chimes from a client towards their  associated servers to trigger rate limits, thus knocking them offline.   I have no answer there other than overprovisioning and generous rate  limits.  > It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.          The packet does not need to be dropped; the association needs to be dropped, or at least rate limited, provided that the origin timestamp is  the one the client sent, which helps to validate that it came from the server (or at least an attacker with access to the network path.)          Processing one timestamp out of the packet (which was originally provided by the client to begin with), on the client itself, just to validate the KoD, seems fairly safe.  > The problem raised is more theoretical than real. Any change would be > detrimental to real live and busy systems.          Unfortunately NTF is facing a series of soon-to-be-published attacks around the KoD functionality.  Validating the origin TS on the client may be the only way to save KoD in campus environments (it's probably dead on the wider Internet after this publication.)          Since the origin TS is copied to the transmit and receive TS fields when sending a KoD, this involves no change to the KoD generation code, so it should not affect deployed systems or harm anything in the field.          It just allows us to slightly harden up the clients handling of a received KoD by validating bidirectional communication. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c7)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 20:11:56 UTC  ``` I've received updated information on this and will be reviewing this. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c8)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:36:11 UTC  ``` I have created a repository here ~mayer/ntp-4.2.8-[Bug2901](show_bug.cgi?id=2901 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.") that makes changes to drop any bogus packets. Only if the packet is validated will it check for KoD's and for RATE it will adjust the rate and it will drop all KoD packets. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c9)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:38:07 UTC  ``` Ready for review. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c10)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-06 08:26:18 UTC  ``` BU folks, thanks for the report.  Danny, thanks for your work on this.  STAGED for 4.2.8p4. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-23 06:27:56 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.77 ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c12)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-21 09:25:35 UTC  ``` As discussed on the ntp hackers list couple months ago, this issue doesn't seem to be fully fixed. When the TEST3 check performed on the transmit timestamp fails, the TEST2 check is skipped and a KoD reply is accepted even when its origin timestamp doesn't match the transmit timestamp from the request. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c13)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-21 11:41:27 UTC  ``` Miroslav,  I'm marking this as IN_PROGRESS per your comment.  I don't yet see what you are describing.  In ntp_proto.c, starting at line 1462, we have the case where:  - we are not in interleave mode - if we are not a KOD packet {(in this case we *are*) clear the origin stamp} - else if(aorg is zero, or the org stamps differ) we: - - flash TEST2 - - log a message about unexpected origin timestamps - - see if this qualifies for starting interleave - - RETURN  This case should cover this bug report - a KoD packet is tested for origin timestamp.  Only if the origin timestamps are OK do we get past this point.  - else we clear the origin timestamp  Otherwise, we *are* handling interleave.  We look for a TEST3 violation.  If there isn't a TEST3 violation we do TEST2 checks for interleaved symmetric mode.  I think I may see a case here - the case where we get a KoD response and we're in interleave mode.  Or do you see something else I'm missing?  Now I'm curious about exactly what should happen with KoD packets in interleave mode. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c14)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-22 08:02:59 UTC  ``` In the current stable code on line 1416 in ntp_proto.c is checked the transmit timestamp. When it's zero the code that checks the origin timestamp starting at line 1462 is not executed. A packet that has zero transmit timestamp avoids validation of the origin timestamp. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c15)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 13:56:52 UTC  ``` I've refactored the way KoD packets are checked to include more than just the origin timestamp (the original thrust of this report).  These fixes are STAGED for 4.2.8p7. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c16)  Harlan Stenn    2016-04-27 04:04:20 UTC  ``` Majdi,  Thanks for the report.  Please check 4.2.8p7 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or IN_PROGRESS, as appropriate. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c17)  Ulrich Windl    2016-06-29 10:38:03 UTC  ``` In 4.2.8p8 I got this message (which is not very helpful): 28 Jun 16:04:25 ntpd[17516]: receive: KoD packet from 172.20.16.7 has inconsistent xmt/org/rec timestamps.  Ignoring.  Maybe more details should be added, like in this message: 28 Jun 16:00:04 ntpd[17516]: receive: Unexpected origin timestamp 0xdb1d0120.83568ef6 does not match aorg 0000000000.00000000 from sym_active@172.20.16.3 xmt 0xdb1d0164.82428466 ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

***The Security of the Network Time Protocol***

**Boston University**

Time is a fundamental building block for computing applications, and is heavily utilized by many cryptographic protocols (eg. [digital certificates and TLS](https://www.thawte.com/resources/getting-started/ssl-faq/%22),
[bitcoin](http://culubas.blogspot.com/2011/05/timejacking-bitcoin_802.html),
[authentication with Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29), [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions), etc). Time on computer clocks is commonly set using the Network Time Protocol ([NTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5905.txt)). This project considers the security of NTP, and its [specifications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905), and its reference implementation [ntpd](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). We consider various threats to NTP that allow an attacker to either (a) alter time on computer systems that set their clocks using NTP (timeshifting attacks), or (b) prevent those systems from synchronizing their clocks (denial of service attacks). We are also designing protocols that can secure NTP against these attacks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:34:45 UTC  ``` It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:  -g   Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction; however, this can happen only once. If the thresh‐ old is exceeded after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This option can be used with the -q and -x options. See the tinker command for other options.  ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by attackers to expire certificates, etc.  This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:35:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1082271](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=diff "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1082271&action=edit "CVE-2015-5300 patch") [CVE-2015-5300](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5300) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c8)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:39:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-22 07:40:18 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1274166](show_bug.cgi?id=1274166 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2015-5300 ntp: MITM attacker can force ntpd to make a step larger than the panic threshold [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-10-26 21:23:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1930 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1930.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1271076#c11)  Fedora Update System    2015-11-02 18:53:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.6p5-34.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository.

                 CVE-2015-7855 CVE-2015-7871

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol
daemon and utility programs:

CVE-2015-5146

   A flaw was found in the way ntpd processed certain remote
   configuration packets. An attacker could use a specially crafted
   package to cause ntpd to crash if:

   * ntpd enabled remote configuration
   * The attacker had the knowledge of the configuration password
   * The attacker had access to a computer entrusted to perform remote
     configuration

   Note that remote configuration is disabled by default in NTP.

CVE-2015-5194

    It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized
    variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration
    commands.

CVE-2015-5195

    It was found that ntpd exits with a segmentation fault when a
    statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g.
    timingstats) is referenced by the statistics or filegen
    configuration command

CVE-2015-5219

    It was discovered that sntp program would hang in an infinite loop
    when a crafted NTP packet was received, related to the conversion
    of the precision value in the packet to double.

CVE-2015-5300

    It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the -g option:

    Normally, ntpd exits with a message to the system log if the offset
    exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ntpd will exit with a message to the system log. This
    option can be used with the -q and -x options.

    ntpd could actually step the clock multiple times by more than the
    panic threshold if its clock discipline doesn't have enough time to
    reach the sync state and stay there for at least one update. If a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can control the NTP traffic since ntpd
    was started (or maybe up to 15-30 minutes after that), they can
    prevent the client from reaching the sync state and force it to step
    its clock by any amount any number of times, which can be used by
    attackers to expire certificates, etc.

    This is contrary to what the documentation says. Normally, the
    assumption is that an MITM attacker can step the clock more than the
    panic threshold only once when ntpd starts and to make a larger
    adjustment the attacker has to divide it into multiple smaller
    steps, each taking 15 minutes, which is slow.

CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702

    It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three
    issues were found in the value length checks in ntp_crypto.c, where
    a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious
    data was not always being completely validated. Receipt of these
    packets can cause ntpd to crash.

CVE-2015-7701

    A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO_ASSOC. If ntpd is
    configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send
    packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack,
    cause it to run out of memory.

CVE-2015-7703

    Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat found that the :config command can be
    used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any
    restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a
    file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd
    process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system
    clock (in hourly intervals). For example:

    ntpq -c ':config pidfile /tmp/ntp.pid'
    ntpq -c ':config driftfile /tmp/ntp.drift'

    In Debian ntpd is configured to drop root privileges, which limits
    the impact of this issue.

CVE-2015-7704

    If ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet
    from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the
    originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from
    its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to
    the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a
    large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.

CVE-2015-7850

    An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote
    configuration functionality of the Network Time Protocol. A
    specially crafted configuration file could cause an endless loop
    resulting in a denial of service.  An attacker could provide a the
    malicious configuration file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2015-7852

    A potential off by one vulnerability exists in the cookedprint
    functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted buffer could cause a
    buffer overflow potentially resulting in null byte being written out
    of bounds.

CVE-2015-7855

    It was found that NTP's decodenetnum() would abort with an assertion
    failure when processing a mode 6 or mode 7 packet containing an
    unusually long data value where a network address was expected. This
    could allow an authenticated attacker to crash ntpd.

CVE-2015-7871

    An error handling logic error exists within ntpd that manifests due
    to improper error condition handling associated with certain
    crypto-NAK packets. An unauthenticated, off-path attacker can force
    ntpd processes on targeted servers to peer with time sources of the
    attacker's choosing by transmitting symmetric active crypto-NAK
    packets to ntpd. This attack bypasses the authentication typically
    required to establish a peer association and allows an attacker to
    make arbitrary changes to system time.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1271070#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-10-13 06:28:38 UTC  ``` When ntpd as an NTP client receives a Kiss-of-Death (KoD) packet from the server to reduce its polling rate, it doesn't check if the originate timestamp in the reply matches the transmit timestamp from its request. An off-path attacker can send a crafted KoD packet to the client, which will increase the client's polling interval to a large value and effectively disable synchronization with the server.  This issue affects ntp versions 4.2.6 and 4.2.8 up to 4.2.8p3.  The attacker can find out to what server the client is currently synchronized by sending it a regular client mode packet and checking the refid field in the reply (the refid is IPv4 address or first four bytes of MD5 sum of IPv6 address).

## Synopsis

Important: ntp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A2520)

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and 6.6 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps
in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the
client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization
with the server. (CVE-2015-7704)

Red Hat would like to thank Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon
Goldberg of Boston University for reporting this issue.

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c0)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-24 20:20:28 UTC  ``` 4.2.6p5 and 4.2.8p2/3 clients have been observed to honor any received KoD with the source address of a sys.peer, even when the packet contains an origin timestamp that does not match the one in the client's chime request. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:47:47 UTC  ``` No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c2)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-25 01:49:22 UTC  ``` I also don't think this is a security issue. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c3)  Majdi S. Abbas    2015-08-26 00:22:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c1)) > No, any KOD packet received should be dropped. The content of the timestamps > are of no value in such a case. See RFC 5905 Section 7.4. If there is a problem > it is that it may not be dropping the packet. Is that what you are observing?  The observations aren't mine, but the problem is that the implementation is honoring, in client mode, KoDs it receives even if they don't match the chime request.  Validating that the KoD matches the original request helps to mitigate a possible attack where an attacker spoofs KoDs from a clients upstream servers, and by walking the refIDs (at least for v4), successfully denies time service to that client (or worse, steers it towards one hostile upstream server.)  > I also don't think this is a security issue.  Unfortunately in a world where BCP38 compliance is far from universal, it's possible to knock a client offline using only a few spoofed packets.    Validating the origin timestamp returned to us matches the one sent is low cost and would help to up the bar on these sorts of attacks. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2015-08-26 05:10:20 UTC  ``` There are clearly problems with any choice here.  Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from good servers.  I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was similarly authenticated.  There are potential problems no matter what we do here.  There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.  We need to let folks make local policy choices. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c5)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 03:18:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c4)) > There are clearly problems with any choice here. >  > Majdi is right, it's possible to launch a DOS attack against a server by > sending it a properly-chosen set of packets designed to throw off the clock and > then send KoD packets to prevent the target from acquiring correct time from > good servers. >   Well not really. If you are properly set up you get multiple packets from different servers and it's extremely hard for an attacker to do this to all of them. In any case, for DENY or RSTR codes the recipient of a kiss code packet is required to drop the association. For RATE it needs to reduce the frequency of queries.   For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet. The values of the timestamps cannot be used. I've had discussions with Dave Mills on some of this and it is clear that this is the design of the kiss codes. Under NO circumstances can the contents of the packets be used so even if there was a DOS attack these packets could not be used for anything to set the clock.  The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more important and required than possible attack vectors.   > I'm now wondering about the situation where if the association is > authenticated, we'd only believe a KoD packet from the server if it was > similarly authenticated. >   It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.   > There are potential problems no matter what we do here. >  > There are conflicting/complementary mechanism choices here.

Any change would be detrimental to real live and busy systems. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c6)  Majdi S.

It turns out it's not that hard, at least in an IPv4 world where we helpfully place the IP address of the server in the refid field. For v6, provided the server is not publicly listed anywhere the truncated hash protects it to some degree.  For public servers it's not hard to pre-compute a table of hash entries, limiting the number of possible v6 addresses to source an attack from.  > For ALL cases the recipient is required to drop the packet.

Under NO > circumstances can the contents of the packets be used so even if there was a > DOS attack these packets could not be used for anything to set the clock.          This has nothing to do with setting the clock; it has to do with validating that a KoD received actually came from our associated server, and wasn't spoofed.  Since the origin TS comes from the client, using it is not providing time service -- it just gives the client a way to  validate bidirectional communication with the server.  > The biggest worry has been the clients that abuse the upstream NTP servers > (this is especially a problem with government servers) and is far more > important and required than possible attack vectors.          At this point the biggest worry is going to be selective denial of service attacks by spoofing chimes from a client towards their  associated servers to trigger rate limits, thus knocking them offline.   I have no answer there other than overprovisioning and generous rate  limits.  > It doesn't matter, the packet needs to be dropped.          The packet does not need to be dropped; the association needs to be dropped, or at least rate limited, provided that the origin timestamp is  the one the client sent, which helps to validate that it came from the server (or at least an attacker with access to the network path.)          Processing one timestamp out of the packet (which was originally provided by the client to begin with), on the client itself, just to validate the KoD, seems fairly safe.  > The problem raised is more theoretical than real. Any change would be > detrimental to real live and busy systems.          Unfortunately NTF is facing a series of soon-to-be-published attacks around the KoD functionality.  Validating the origin TS on the client may be the only way to save KoD in campus environments (it's probably dead on the wider Internet after this publication.)          Since the origin TS is copied to the transmit and receive TS fields when sending a KoD, this involves no change to the KoD generation code, so it should not affect deployed systems or harm anything in the field.          It just allows us to slightly harden up the clients handling of a received KoD by validating bidirectional communication. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c7)  Danny Mayer    2015-08-28 20:11:56 UTC  ``` I've received updated information on this and will be reviewing this. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c8)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:36:11 UTC  ``` I have created a repository here ~mayer/ntp-4.2.8-[Bug2901](show_bug.cgi?id=2901 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin timestamp field.") that makes changes to drop any bogus packets. Only if the packet is validated will it check for KoD's and for RATE it will adjust the rate and it will drop all KoD packets. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c9)  Danny Mayer    2015-09-27 02:38:07 UTC  ``` Ready for review. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c10)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-06 08:26:18 UTC  ``` BU folks, thanks for the report.  Danny, thanks for your work on this.  STAGED for 4.2.8p4. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-23 06:27:56 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.2.8p4 and 4.3.77 ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c12)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-21 09:25:35 UTC  ``` As discussed on the ntp hackers list couple months ago, this issue doesn't seem to be fully fixed. When the TEST3 check performed on the transmit timestamp fails, the TEST2 check is skipped and a KoD reply is accepted even when its origin timestamp doesn't match the transmit timestamp from the request. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c13)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-21 11:41:27 UTC  ``` Miroslav,  I'm marking this as IN_PROGRESS per your comment.  I don't yet see what you are describing.  In ntp_proto.c, starting at line 1462, we have the case where:  - we are not in interleave mode - if we are not a KOD packet {(in this case we *are*) clear the origin stamp} - else if(aorg is zero, or the org stamps differ) we: - - flash TEST2 - - log a message about unexpected origin timestamps - - see if this qualifies for starting interleave - - RETURN  This case should cover this bug report - a KoD packet is tested for origin timestamp.  Only if the origin timestamps are OK do we get past this point.  - else we clear the origin timestamp  Otherwise, we *are* handling interleave.  We look for a TEST3 violation.  If there isn't a TEST3 violation we do TEST2 checks for interleaved symmetric mode.  I think I may see a case here - the case where we get a KoD response and we're in interleave mode.  Or do you see something else I'm missing?  Now I'm curious about exactly what should happen with KoD packets in interleave mode. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c14)  Miroslav Lichvar    2016-01-22 08:02:59 UTC  ``` In the current stable code on line 1416 in ntp_proto.c is checked the transmit timestamp. When it's zero the code that checks the origin timestamp starting at line 1462 is not executed. A packet that has zero transmit timestamp avoids validation of the origin timestamp. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c15)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-23 13:56:52 UTC  ``` I've refactored the way KoD packets are checked to include more than just the origin timestamp (the original thrust of this report).  These fixes are STAGED for 4.2.8p7. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c16)  Harlan Stenn    2016-04-27 04:04:20 UTC  ``` Majdi,  Thanks for the report.  Please check 4.2.8p7 and mark this bug as VERIFIED or IN_PROGRESS, as appropriate. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2901#c17)  Ulrich Windl    2016-06-29 10:38:03 UTC  ``` In 4.2.8p8 I got this message (which is not very helpful): 28 Jun 16:04:25 ntpd[17516]: receive: KoD packet from 172.20.16.7 has inconsistent xmt/org/rec timestamps.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

---

## Synopsis

Important: ntp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1930)

## Topic

Updated ntp packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

It was discovered that ntpd as a client did not correctly check timestamps
in Kiss-of-Death packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
crafted Kiss-of-Death packet to an ntpd client that would increase the
client's polling interval value, and effectively disable synchronization
with the server. (CVE-2015-7704)

It was found that ntpd did not correctly implement the threshold limitation
for the '-g' option, which is used to set the time without any
restrictions. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to intercept NTP traffic
between a connecting client and an NTP server could use this flaw to force
that client to make multiple steps larger than the panic threshold,
effectively changing the time to an arbitrary value. (CVE-2015-5300)

Red Hat would like to thank Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon
Goldberg of Boston University for reporting these issues.

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

#### Description

An `ntpd` client that honors Kiss-of-Death responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target’s time source by sending the target a time query.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you cannot upgrade, restrict who can query `ntpd` to learn who its servers are, and what IPs are allowed to ask your system for the time. This mitigation is heavy-handed.
* Monitor your `ntpd` instances.

> **NOTE:** 4.2.8p4 protects against the first attack. For the second attack, all we can do is warn when it is happening, which we do in 4.2.8p4.

This weakness was discovered by Aanchal Malhotra, Issac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg of Boston University.

# Novel NTP Attacks Roll Back Time

Researchers at Boston University have published new attacks against the Network Time Protocol (NTP) that jeopardize the security of numerous online activities.

Sharon Goldberg remembers the cold February day when her Boston University PhD candidate Aanchal Malhotra was studying routing security, in particular, attacks against the resource public key infrastructure (RPKI)—and kept hitting a dead end because of a cache-flushing issue.

The resourceful Malhotra decided to roll back the time on her computer as a last-ditch effort, and it worked.

“She was able to do the attack and I asked her what she did,” said Goldberg, an associate professor in the BU computer science department. “She said she changed the time with NTP and it worked. We were both saying ‘Whoa.'”

Inadvertently, Malhotra had stumbled across serious security vulnerabilities in the network time protocol used to synchronize computer clocks, that could allow an attacker on a network—say in a man-in-the-middle position—to, at scale if they so wished, roll back time on computers and affect cryptographic calculations, carry out denial of service attacks, or impact the effectiveness of security implementations such as DNSSEC.

“We are extremely surprised no one thought of this as an attack vector,” Goldberg said. “We realized this is a powerful tool to do attacks against other systems that are impacted by time. Most cryptography uses timestamps; they’re there for a reason. If they’re not accurate, it’s a problem.”

Goldberg, Malhotra and fellow BU students Isaac E. Cohen and Erik Brakke published a paper this week called “[Attacking the Network Time Protocol](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/papers/NTPattack.pdf)” that describes a handful of attacks against NTP that are successful because of insufficient authentication and cryptographic shortcomings that allow an attacker to roll back time and cause various levels of havoc on the Internet.

This isn’t the first time that hackers have taken advantage of vulnerabilities in NTP. In late 2013 and early 2014, high profile distributed denial of service attacks were carried out by [amplifying traffic from NTP servers](https://threatpost.com/ntp-amplification-blamed-for-400-gbps-ddos-attack/104201/); attackers able to spoof a victim’s IP address were able to funnel copious amounts of traffic overwhelming targeted domains.

The vulnerabilities uncovered by the BU researchers can be exploited with various levels of sophistication on the attackers’ part, Goldberg said.

The easiest involves the use of a so-called [Kiss-of-Death packet](http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.1/accopt.htm) to exploit a rate-limiter built into NTP. The attacker can exploit this situation from anywhere—an off-path attack—by spoofing a single Kiss of Death packet and can stop a client from querying a server for years if the attacker so chooses, and no longer update its clock.

“Because the attacker need only send a few Kiss-o’-Death packets per victim client, standard network scanning tools (nmap, zmap) can be adapted to very quickly launch this attack, in bulk, on most of the ntpd clients in the Internet,” Goldberg et al wrote on the project’s [portal](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/NTPattack.html). The page also includes extensive mitigation advice for patching NTP servers and clients.

Goldberg said that such an attack can be done at scale by scanning the IPv4 address space and listening for responses from vulnerable servers. The patch rolled out this week from the keepers of NTP makes it much more difficult to construct a Kiss of Death packet, Goldberg said.

Goldberg said most of the previous work around attacking NTP involves man-in-the-middle attacks, including a [paper](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Selvi-Bypassing-HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security.pdf) done for Black Hat last summer by Jose Selvi using NTP to bypass HSTS protections. Goldberg and the students used one of Selvi’s tools, [Delorean](https://github.com/PentesterES/Delorean), in their research.

“What’s been happening the last couple of years is that there’s been more work on off-path attacks. Off-path attacks don’t intercept traffic, it’s just someone with a computer sending packets,” Goldberg said. “It’s a much scarier threat model.”

The researchers also describe in their paper a denial of service attack where even if the Kiss-of-Death packet vulnerability is patched, an attacker could still use the packet to disable NTP on the victim’s client.

“Here, the attacker *elicits* a valid KoD packet from the client’s preconfigured servers by ‘priming the pump’, i.e., sending the servers a high volume of queries that are spoofed to look like they come from the client,” they wrote. “The servers then start rate-limiting the client, responding to each of its subsequent queries with a valid KoD packet. Upon receipt of the KoD, the client stops querying its servers, and can no longer update its local clock.”

A third attack requires an attacker be in man-in-the-middle position and able to hijack traffic to an NTP server using BGP or DNS hijacks. The attack rolls back time on the server’s clients that circumvents a 16-minute panic threshold built into NTP and allows an attacker to manipulate the client’s cache and cause, for example, a cryptographic object to expire, they wrote.

The final attack is carried out by an off-path attacker and also rolls back time on the client side by exploiting problems in IPv4 packet fragmentation, the researchers wrote.
