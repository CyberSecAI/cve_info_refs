Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation in OpenShift's API backend when handling requests for pod log locations. Specifically, the API did not verify the container name provided in the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of validation for the container name when constructing the URL for retrieving pod logs.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** A pod could potentially access the log files of other pods on the same node by manipulating the container name in the log request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious pod, or potentially an attacker who has gained access to execute commands within a pod, could exploit this vulnerability to access the log files of other pods running on the same node.
- **Confidentiality Violation:** Log files often contain sensitive information, such as configuration details, secrets, and other application-specific data. Access to these logs could expose confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Request Manipulation:** An attacker could send a crafted API request to the OpenShift API server to retrieve log files of a target pod running on the same node. The attacker would need to be running code within a pod, or have gained the ability to make authenticated calls to the API server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to make requests to the OpenShift API. This could be achieved by:
    - Having a pod running in the same node as the target pod.
    - Compromising a pod or node to be able to make API calls.
    - Potentially having compromised credentials or having another means of authenticating to the API

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring the container name is validated before fetching the log location.
- This vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 and 3.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jordan Liggitt of Red Hat Atomic OpenShift.
- The fix was delivered via RHSA-2015:2544 and RHSA-2015:2615
