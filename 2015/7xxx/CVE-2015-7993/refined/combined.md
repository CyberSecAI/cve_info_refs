==================================

SAP HANA is a platform for real-time business. It combines database,
data processing, and application platform capabilities in-memory. The
platform provides libraries for predictive, planning, text processing,
spatial, and business analytics.

The SAP HANA Platform integrates a web server called the SAP HANA
Extended Application Services (XS engine). This service allows customers
to access information stored in the SAP HANA Database through web
applications.

By sending a crafted HTTP packet to the SAP HANA XS Server, a remote
unauthenticated attacker could fully compromise the platform executing
arbitrary code or performing a Denial of Service, thus rendering the
platform unavailable until the next process restart.
