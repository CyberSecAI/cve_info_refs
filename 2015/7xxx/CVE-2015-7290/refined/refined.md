The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7290.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `pwd` parameter in the `adv_pwd_cgi` of the web management interface is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `pwd` parameter.
- The web management interface doesn't properly neutralize script-related HTML tags in the `pwd` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the user's browser.
- This could lead to the attacker performing actions with the same permissions as the victim user, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions within the web management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through the web management interface of the affected ARRIS cable modem.
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `pwd` parameter.
- The attacker then induces the victim user to click on the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into accessing the crafted URL through the web management interface.
