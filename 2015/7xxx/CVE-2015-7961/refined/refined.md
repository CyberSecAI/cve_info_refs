Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-7961:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to subdirectories and executable modules during the installation of SafeNet Authentication Service agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The installation process sets insufficient access restrictions on the agent's file structure. Specifically, "Authenticated Users" are granted excessive permissions, including full control, modify, and write access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Any authenticated user, including guests, can gain full control over the agent's file structure.
*   **Malicious Modification:** Attackers can modify or substitute executable modules within the agent's installation directory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By replacing legitimate executables with malicious ones, an attacker can escalate privileges when a user with higher permissions executes the compromised module.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have some level of access to the target system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** Exploitation involves manipulating the file system by modifying executable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, even with limited privileges (including guest accounts).
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to access the agent's installation directory.

**Specific Affected Product:**

*   SafeNet Authentication Service Remote Web Workplace Agent

**Mitigation**

*   A manual mitigation process is outlined involving modifying permissions on the agent's installation folder.  The steps involve removing full control, modify, and write permissions for authenticated users and ensuring only read and execute permissions, while granting full permissions to the Administrators group and ensuring that these changes are inherited by all child objects.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is also present in other SafeNet Authentication Service Agents.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity, which could potentially allow an attacker to gain full access to the compromised host.
