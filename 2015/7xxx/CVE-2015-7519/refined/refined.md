  "response": {
    "root_cause": "Phusion Passenger was not filtering HTTP headers correctly when converting them for the SCGI protocol, specifically when processing headers containing underscores instead of dashes. The conversion to uppercase with underscores resulted in header collisions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper filtering of HTTP headers during SCGI conversion",
      "Loss of distinction between dashes and underscores in header names",
      "Header collision vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could spoof headers passed to applications. By injecting a header with an underscore instead of a dash, attackers could overwrite a header set by the server, potentially leading to authentication bypass or other security implications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious headers containing underscores"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Phusion Passenger instance. The attacker needs to know or guess the header names used by the application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
