*Phusion Passenger - the smart app server*

What makes Passenger so fast and reliable is its **C++** core, its **zero-copy** architecture, its **watchdog** system and its **hybrid** evented, multi-threaded and multi-process design.

## Installation

Please follow [the installation instructions on the website](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/tutorials/what_is_passenger/).

### Installing the source directly from git

If you mean to install the latest version of Passenger directly from this git repository, then you should run one of the following commands. Installing from the git repository is basically the same as the tarball installation method, as [described in the manual](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/tutorials/installation/ruby/), with one exception: you need to clone git submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

```

After that, run one of the following:

```
./bin/passenger-install-apache2-module

```

-OR-

```
./bin/passenger-install-nginx-module

```

-OR-

```
# From your application directory
~/path-to-passenger/bin/passenger start

```

For troubleshooting, configuration and tips, please also refer to the above documentation. For further support, please refer to [the Phusion Passenger support page](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/support).

Ruby users can also build a gem from the Git repository and install the gem.

```
gem build passenger.gemspec
gem install passenger-x.x.x.gem

```

Subject: CVE-2015-7519: Phusion Passenger Header overwriting issue

Header overwriting issue in Phusion Passenger
<https://www.phusionpassenger.com/> - <https://github.com/phusion/passenger>
CRD was 2015-12-07 11:00 UTC / 12:00 CET.
Upstream developers were informed and agreed, and issued the text below and the attached patch. Fixed in release 5.0.22.
Discovered by Moises Deniz, Michael Schröder, Adrian Schröter of SUSE Linux.
SUSE bug: <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956281>

<https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/ddb8ecc4ebf260e4967f57f271d4f5761abeac3e>

CVE-2015-7519 was assigned to this issue.

------------ issue -------------
1. Given the precondition that the SCGI protocol is used (in Passenger
this means Rack/Rails or Python), and an app depends on a header set by
a trusted server (here: Apache) that includes a dash, for example:
Foobar-User: user

2. It is possible for an untrusted remote client to set a "colliding"
header:
Foobar_User: impersonation

3. The colliding header appears different to the server (_ instead of -)
and is thus not overwritten but preserved.

4. Conversion of the headers for SCGI requires dropping the (_ -)
difference, which results in Passenger sending two headers with the same
key:
HTTP_FOOBAR_USER: user
HTTP_FOOBAR_USER: impersonation

The exploit is then that the value "impersonation" of the second
HTTP_FOOBAR_USER may overwrite the value of the first (if a hashmap is
used), making the application believe a different value was set by the
server.

Indeed, we can make request.headers["HTTP_FOOBAR_USER"] show
"impersonation" instead of "user", confirming the issue, which can have
security implications, e.g. if the header is used for authentication.

------------ affected use-cases -------------
As far as we can see, affected use-cases are:
- Passenger, with Apache (Nginx already filters) or standalone/builtin,
using a Ruby or Python app (Node.js/Meteor/io.js don't use SCGI),
whereby the app depends on a server-set variable containing one or more
dashes.

------------ resolution -------------
We propose a different patch; not in the apache module but at the point
where the SCGI conversion occurs. The main reason is that this covers
the second affected path: standalone mode using the 'builtin' engine.
See attached (N.B. the httpToEnv you patched is unreferenced code and
has now been cleaned up).

The patch has been committed to the (internal) cgi_header_collision
passenger branch and is pending merge to stable, to be included in the
upcoming 5.0.22 release (ASAP).

------------ side-effects -------------
Like the patch in the mod_cgi mailing list, this one still breaks
applications that depend on non-standard (e.g. underscored) client
headers. Similarly, the workaround is the same, rewrite the necessary
header(s):
SetEnvIfNoCase ^X.Underscored.Header $ ^(.*)$ fix_header=$1
RequestHeader set X-Underscored-Header %{fix_header}e env=fix_header

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c0)  Adrian Schröter   2015-11-23 15:18:04 UTC  ``` Passenger is not filter Headers when exporting them to the environment like apache is doing it. In our setup this caused a grave security issue since it was possible to inject a variable by using "_" instead of "-" . The ruby web application has no chance to distinguish between the variables.  We patched passenger to filter the export of the headers to environement analog to apache code. the fix can be found here:   [https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS:Server:Unstable/rubygem-passenger/fix-header-handling.diff?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS%3AServer%3AUnstable/rubygem-passenger/fix-header-handling.diff?expand=1)  based on passenger 5.0.28 ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-23 16:15:31 UTC  ``` Reported privately to security@phusion.nl, receipt was acknowledged. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c2)  Michael Schröder   2015-11-23 16:50:55 UTC  ``` proposal on apache mailing list: [https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg49097.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40httpd.apache.org/msg49097.html)  commit: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1053353>  Btw, nginx has a "underscores_in_headers" option (where the default is off). So passanger under nginx is probably safe.  I guess that mod_passenger should also have such an option. Our patch currently doesn't implement that.  (Also note that the commit's claim "RFC 2616 says that header names must start with a letter, followed only by letters, numbers or hyphen" is bogus. Underscores are perfectly legal.) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-23 17:37:31 UTC  ``` Similar code is in since the first release (tag release-1.0.0) where this code is in ext/apache2/Hooks.cpp http2env() prior to re-factoring. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-11-23 23:00:40 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-26 17:05:59 UTC  ``` sent to distros CRD: 2015-12-07 11:00 UTC ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c11)  Alexander Bergmann   2015-11-27 07:27:42 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-7519 was assigned to this issue. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c12)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-27 09:32:49 UTC  ``` Assign to SLE maintainer ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2015-11-30 18:25:35 UTC  ``` Do you have a test code? ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c14)  SMASH SMASH   2015-12-01 06:58:54 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

## About us

Founded in 2008, Phusion creates top of the line server software to power businesses like Apple and Intercom.

It was discovered by the SUSE security team that it was possible, in some cases, for clients to overwrite headers set by the server, resulting in a medium level security issue. [CVE-2015-7519](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2015-7519) has been assigned to this issue. See also [the SUSE issue report](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956281).

## Affected use-cases

Header overwriting may occur if all of the following conditions are met:

* **Apache** integration mode, or **standalone+builtin** engine without a filtering proxy
* Ruby or Python applications only (Passenger 5); or any application (Passenger 4)
* The app depends on a **request header containing a dash** (-)
* The header is supposed to be trusted (set by the server)
* The client correctly guesses the header name

The issue is that internally, Passenger 5 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to Ruby/Python applications, while Passenger 4 uses an SCGI-inspired format to pass headers to all applications. This implies a conversion to UPPER\_CASE\_WITH\_UNDERSCORES whereby the difference between characters like "-" and "\_" is lost. An example of an attack:

* User Mallory guesses that internally, `X-User` is used as an authentication header
* Mallory sends a request with `X_User: Bob`, `X-Auth-Token: ValidMallory`
* Apache sees a valid `X-Auth-Token`, adds authentication header `X-User: Mallory`, lets the request through
* Passenger converts `X-User: Bob` and `X_User: Mallory` to `HTTP_X_USER: Bob`, `HTTP_X_USER: Mallory`
* The headers collide and the application might see `HTTP_X_USER: Bob` and assume Bob was authenticated

## Fixed in Passenger 5.0.22, 4.0.60

This vulnerability affects all Passenger versions prior to 4.0.60 and 5.0.22.

It has been fixed by filtering out client headers that do not consist of alphanumeric/dash characters (Nginx already did this, so Passenger+Nginx was not affected). If your application depends on headers that don't conform to this, you can add a workaround in Apache specifically for those to convert them to a dash-based format. For example:

```
# Workaround, for untrusted (client) headers only!
SetEnvIfNoCase ^X_Nonconfirming_Client_Header $ ^(.*)$ fix_header=$1
RequestHeader set X-Nonconfirming-Client-Header %{fix_header}e env=fix_header

```

See the individual blog posts about the Passenger [5.0.22](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/12/07/passenger-5-0-22/) and [4.0.60](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/12/07/passenger-4-0-60/) releases for upgrade instructions and information about other changes.

## Supercharge your Ruby, Node.js and Python apps

Over 650,000+ sites use **Passenger** as their app server to ensure that their web apps, microservices and APIs are served with outstanding reliability, performance and control.

Phusion may process personal data through its website(s), (mobile) (web) application(s), software, technical support, consultation, live chat, product information, etc., through the process of maintaining and upgrading Phusionâs products, through automated means such as communications protocols, e-mail communications, cookies, social connectors, Phusion-affiliated social networking areas, Phusion ads placed on third party sites, product registration, call centers, trade shows, training seminars, conferences and other expressions.

Phusion greatly values the privacy of its customers and other people and therefore takes the utmost care in the handling and protection, of personal data. Phusion complies with the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Phusion is the party who is responsible for how this data will be used. In this Privacy Statement, Phusion explains which data Phusion collects and for what purposes it will be used. In addition to individuals, companies can also make use of Phusionâs website(s) and (web)application(s). However, the GDPR does not apply to corporate data. This Privacy Statement therefore focuses primarily on individuals.

### Processing of personal data

Personal data is data which can be used to identify you. Phusion makes a distinction between:

* personal information you actively provide to Phusion, and
* personal information which is automatically passed on to Phusion for technical reasons.

Personal information you actively provide to Phusion, can for instance be: your name, contact preferences and other information you provide to Phusion (e.g. during a registration process or during contact with an employee of Phusion).

Also, by visiting Phusionâs website(s) and the use of Phusionâs (web) applications, software or other expressions, some technical data will automatically be sent by your equipment to Phusionâs computers, such as the IP address used by you, the operating system, the used Internet browser and (in some cases) the last web page you visited.

### Processing purpose

Any personal data processed by Phusion will only be used for the following purposes:

* for the providing of the services offered on Phusionâs website(s), (web) application(s), software and other expressions,* to ensure the security and availability of Phusionâs website(s), (web) application(s), software and other expressions,
  * to communicate with you,
  * to inform you of new products and/or offers of Phusion,
  * analyzing and improving Phusionâs service (including the measurement and analysis of statistical data about your use),
  * to conduct market research on behalf of Phusion,
  * any other processing of your personal data will only be done if you have given Phusion your unambiguous consent. Such consent may appear from the mere fact that you ask a question by email or in another digital way.

### Newsletter

Phusion's newsletter(s) are sent to the subscriber(s) of one or more of Phusionâs newsletter(s). The subscriptions consist of two groups:

* Persons who have registered on Phusion's website(s); or through Â­third-party newsletter management service(s) that Phusion uses, such as Mailchimp.
* Existing customers of Phusion.

Registration through our website(s) and third-party newsletter management service(s) takes place by means of a double opt-in process. You will only be listed as a subscriber if you follow the instructions you will receive by email after the registration process. This ensures that only those who will receive our registration email can subscribe to our newsletter.

It is also possible that existing customers will be added to the subscription base at the request of an employee of Phusion. This only happens if such customers have given explicit consent for this fact.

Every newsletter provides a means to unsubscribe from the newsletter, for example by providing a hyperlink at the bottom to an unsubscribe page.

The legal basis for processing is either because it's necessary for the performance of a contract to which the recipient is party, or because itâs necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest of Phusion.

### Cookies

Phusionâs website(s) and (web) application(s) sometimes use cookies (small data files Â­placed on your computer) or other technologies. These technologies, among other things, are used for strictly necessary functional purposes:

* Providing you the correct operation of the website / web application. Legal basis for processing: performing a contract.
* Logging into the website(s) or web application(s). Legal basis for processing: performing a contract.
* As a security measure to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Legal basis for processing: legitimate interest.

Some cookies are not strictly necessary or functional, and are for:

* Measuring the effectiveness of its services and to give Phusion more insight into user behavior, showing which parts of our website(s) have been visited. Legal basis for processing: legitimate interest.

When cookies are not merely "functional", the visitor or user has given consent for the processing. When the visitor or user doesn't consent, they can accept or decline cookies through the browser settings.

### Web Beacons

Some of our web pages and HTML-formatted email use web beacons, or other technologies, in conjunction with cookies to compile statistics about website and newsletter usage. We use these statistics to optimize the effectiveness of our websites and newsletter campaigns.

A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie identifier, time and date of a page view and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. You may render web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies, or by blocking the associated images.

Web beacons on websites are used to compile aggregate, anonymized statistics. Web beacons in newsletters (HTML-formatted email) are used to determine which individual subscribers open which emails.

### Retention of personal data

Newsletter subscriber information -- including information collected through web beacons -- is retained until you unsubscribe. When a recipient is unsubscribed, we will only use the personal data to make sure the former recipient will not receive any of our newsletters anymore.

### Rights

All website(s), text, images, videos and other manifestations are owned and operated by Phusion. Phusion respects your privacy and ensures that the personal information that you may provide to us is treated confidentially.

In the case Phusion is the controller of your personal data, you (the data subject) have the following rights:

* You can ask us to access, rectify or erase your personal data.
* You may restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.
* You have the right to data portability.

These rights, however, can be limited by other rules and regulations. You can also lodge a complaint regarding the processing of personal data of Phusion at the Dutch supervisory authority "Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens".

### Modifications

Phusion reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Any changes will be announced on our website(s). Phusion can process your personal data for new purposes that are not mentioned in this Privacy Statement. In that case, we will notify you on our website(s) about the changes in the Privacy Statement before using your data for these new purposes. If you do not want Phusion to use your data, you always have the possibility to opt out by sending an email to info@phusion.nl.

### Applicable law

With respect to any dispute arising from this privacy statement, Dutch law, in the Dutch language, shall be applicable. The district court of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, shall be the single competent court, unless another court has jurisdiction.

### Contact

If you have questions or concerns about the Disclaimer or our privacy statement, or if you wish to access, alter or delete your personal data, you can always contact us via info@phusion.nl. You may also contact us via postal mail at the following address:

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Package        : ruby-passenger
Version        : 4.0.53-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-7519 CVE-2018-12029
Debian Bug     : 864651

Two flaws were discovered in ruby-passenger for Ruby Rails and Rack
support that allowed attackers to spoof HTTP headers or exploit a race
condition which made privilege escalation under certain conditions
possible.

CVE-2015-7519
    Remote attackers could spoof headers passed to applications by using
    an underscore character instead of a dash character in an HTTP
    header as demonstrated by an X_User header.

CVE-2018-12029
    A vulnerability was discovered by the Pulse Security team. It was
    exploitable only when running a non-standard
    passenger_instance_registry_dir, via a race condition where after a
    file was created, there was a window in which it could be replaced
    with a symlink before it was chowned via the path and not the file
    descriptor. If the symlink target was to a file which would be
    executed by root such as root's crontab file, then privilege
    escalation was possible. This is now mitigated by using fchown().

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.0.53-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-passenger packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

In our setup this caused a grave security issue since it was possible to inject a variable by using "_" instead of "-" . The ruby web application has no chance to distinguish between the variables.  We patched passenger to filter the export of the headers to environement analog to apache code. the fix can be found here:   [https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS:Server:Unstable/rubygem-passenger/fix-header-handling.diff?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS%3AServer%3AUnstable/rubygem-passenger/fix-header-handling.diff?expand=1)  based on passenger 5.0.28 ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-23 16:15:31 UTC  ``` Reported privately to security@phusion.nl, receipt was acknowledged. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c2)  Michael Schröder   2015-11-23 16:50:55 UTC  ``` proposal on apache mailing list: [https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg49097.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40httpd.apache.org/msg49097.html)  commit: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1053353>  Btw, nginx has a "underscores_in_headers" option (where the default is off). So passanger under nginx is probably safe.  I guess that mod_passenger should also have such an option. Our patch currently doesn't implement that.  (Also note that the commit's claim "RFC 2616 says that header names must start with a letter, followed only by letters, numbers or hyphen" is bogus. Underscores are perfectly legal.) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-23 17:37:31 UTC  ``` Similar code is in since the first release (tag release-1.0.0) where this code is in ext/apache2/Hooks.cpp http2env() prior to re-factoring. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-11-23 23:00:40 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c10)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-26 17:05:59 UTC  ``` sent to distros CRD: 2015-12-07 11:00 UTC ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c11)  Alexander Bergmann   2015-11-27 07:27:42 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-7519 was assigned to this issue. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c12)  Andreas Stieger   2015-11-27 09:32:49 UTC  ``` Assign to SLE maintainer ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c13)  Jordi Massaguer   2015-11-30 18:25:35 UTC  ``` Do you have a test code? ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c14)  SMASH SMASH   2015-12-01 06:58:54 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

I am replacing the reproducer since the instruccions in the README were wrong. Sorry about that.  In order to reproduce it , you need to do  curl -H "X_username: test" <http://localhost>  With the original rpm , you should see this output  HTTP_X_USERNAME test  With the patched rpm:  HTTP_X_USERNAME  note the test has been filtered.  What the patch does is to accept "-" or alphanums, but not "_" . Otherwise, "x_username" would overwrite HTTP_X_USERNAME header. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c20)  Jordi Massaguer   2015-12-16 11:45:21 UTC  ``` for apache  < 2.4 you need to adjust the /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/test-cve-2015-7519.conf  See the comments in the same file. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c21)  Jordi Massaguer   2015-12-16 19:03:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 659602](attachment.cgi?id=659602&action=diff "patch for version 3.0.14") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=659602&action=edit "patch for version 3.0.14") patch for version 3.0.14 ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=956281#c24)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-12-21 22:10:39 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:2337-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

Copy link    Quote reply     @runephilosof **[runephilosof](/runephilosof)** [Jan 26, 2016](#r15678564)  This needs to be clarified more. It is backwards incompatible change that will break apps using request headers that contain underscores. Warn about it and link to the workaround blog post <https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/12/07/cve-2015-7519/>      All reactions | | |
|  |  | \* [Apache] Fixes compatibility with Apache 2.4.17's mod\_autoindex. Fix contributed by Eric Covener. Closes GH-1642. |
|  |  | \* [Standalone] Passenger Standalone now [accepts configuration options from environment variables](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/standalone/intro.html). This makes using Passenger Standalone significantly easier on Heroku or on systems that follow the 12-factor principle. Closes GH-1661. |
|  |  | \* [Standalone] The Nginx configuration template has been cleaned up. It is now significantly easier to edit the Nginx configuration template without breaking compatibility with future versions. |

## Supercharge Your Web App

Passenger has a myriad of features that are invaluable to today’s web apps and microservice APIs. You get these benefits (and more) by simply installing Passenger with Nginx or Apache. [Learn how](/features).

### Optimization

Passenger was built with high performance and efficiency in mind. With Passenger’s zero-copy architecture, turbocaching and support for multiple concurrency models, you can count on Passenger to get the most out of your hardware.

### Stability

Passenger auto-manages your apps’ processes, restarting them and itself if they ever crash. Passenger also keeps resource hogging apps in check, giving your web app maximum uptime.

### Documentation

A tool is only as good as its users are able to wield it. Passenger comes with world class documentation to allow you to fully leverage its features.

### Security

Passenger protects your web apps from various malicious attacks like slow client attacks, common HTTP parser exploits and privilege escalations.

### Reliability

Passenger was battle-tested with some of the most demanding web apps for over a decade. This makes it one of the toughest app servers to date, currently powering over 650,000 web apps.

### Polyglot

Deploy all your apps from one Passenger instance in seconds, regardless of the language they’re written in. No need to fiddle around with multiple app servers and proxies anymore!

## You too can deploy apps with confidence

Learn what else Passenger can do for you.
