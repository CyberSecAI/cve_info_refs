{
  "CVE-2015-7929": {
    "description": "The eWON firmware web server allows the use of the HTML command GET in place of POST. GET is less secure because data that are sent are part of the URL.",
    "root_cause": "The web server allows using GET requests where POST requests should be used.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure use of HTTP GET method for data submission."
    ],
    "impact": "Information leakage. Sensitive information is sent through the URL parameters instead of the secure request body.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can use GET requests to expose sensitive data passed in URLs.",
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have network access to the device and the ability to craft a malicious URL. Low skill level required to perform an attack."
  }
