- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain Apple-signed executables loaded applications from relative locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Apple-signed executables load applications, specifically from relative locations, which bypasses Gatekeeper's intended security checks. This lack of proper validation could allow for arbitrary file loading.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to load arbitrary files by exploiting the way Apple-signed executables handle relative paths. This could lead to the execution of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting Apple-signed executables which load applications using relative paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to supply or modify the relative paths used by these executables to point to a malicious file that they want to execute.
