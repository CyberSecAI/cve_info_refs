{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-7580",
  "vulnerability": {
    "summary": "The rails-html-sanitizer gem before 1.0.3 for Ruby on Rails 4.2.x and 5.x is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "details": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the rails-html-sanitizer gem before 1.0.3, specifically in the `lib/rails/html/scrubbers.rb` file. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML through a crafted CDATA node. The whitelist sanitizer in the gem does not properly handle CDATA nodes, leading to the possibility of bypassing sanitization and injecting malicious code.",
    "affected_components": [
      "rails-html-sanitizer gem before 1.0.3 for Ruby on Rails 4.2.x and 5.x"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of CDATA nodes by the whitelist sanitizer within the rails-html-sanitizer gem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper handling of CDATA nodes",
      "Bypass of sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, leading to potential compromise of user sessions, data theft, or defacement of the web application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network attacks",
      "Crafted CDATA nodes in user-supplied input"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted CDATA nodes as user input, which will then be processed by the vulnerable rails-html-sanitizer gem.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade to rails-html-sanitizer gem version 1.0.3 or later. A workaround is available that monkey patches the `Rails::Html::PermitScrubber` class to convert CDATA nodes to text nodes prior to processing"
  }
