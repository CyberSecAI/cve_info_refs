Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `save_config` function within `ntpd`'s configuration file saving mechanism, specifically on OpenVMS systems. This function attempts to sanitize file paths by removing backslashes (`\`) and forward slashes (`/`). However, on OpenVMS, directory separation is done using characters like periods (`.`), hyphens (`-`), and colons (`:`). This allows an attacker to craft a malicious path using these characters, which are not sanitized, leading to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended directory restriction and potentially save configuration files to arbitrary locations on the file system. The function `save_config` did not account for the directory separator characters used in OpenVMS, only for forward and backslashes.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `save_config` function does not perform adequate sanitization of the input filename on OpenVMS systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **File Overwriting:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite existing files on the target system. This could lead to a variety of issues, including denial of service, modification of system configurations, or potentially, arbitrary code execution if configuration files are overwritten with malicious content.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Overwriting certain files could lead to privilege escalation in specific scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Configuration:** The vulnerability can be exploited if `ntpd` is configured to allow remote configuration. The attacker would need to send a specifically crafted `saveconfig` command to the `ntpd` daemon.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send commands to the vulnerable `ntpd` instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable `ntpd` service.
- **Remote Configuration Enabled:** The `ntpd` service must be configured to allow remote configuration.
- **Authentication Bypass (if enabled):** If authentication is enabled, the attacker needs to either know the remote configuration password or exploit a vulnerability that allows them to bypass authentication (although this specific CVE does not address an authentication bypass vulnerability).
- **Knowledge of VMS Path Separators:** The attacker needs to be aware of the characters used for path separation in OpenVMS.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specific to OpenVMS systems.
- The vulnerability was addressed in ntp-4.2.8p4 and later.
- The provided content includes a CVSS v2 score of 5.2 for this issue with the vector (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:P/A:C)
