The only generally-exploitable bug in the above list is the crypto-NAK bug, which has a CVSS2 score of 6.4.

Additionally, three bugs that have already been fixed in ntp-4.2.8 but were not fixed in ntp-4.2.6 as it was EOL’d have a security component, but are all below 1.8 CVSS score, so we’re reporting them here:

* [2382: Peer precision < -31 gives division by zero](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug2382/)
* [1774: Segfaults if cryptostats enabled when built without OpenSSL](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1774/)
* [1593: ntpd abort in free() with logconfig syntax error](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/ntpbug1593/)

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2015-0062

## Network Time Protocol ntpd saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability

##### October 21, 2015

##### CVE Number

CVE-2015-7851

##### Description

A potential path traversal vulnerability exists in the config file saving of ntpd on VMS. A specially crafted path could cause a path traversal potentially resulting in files being overwritten. An attacker could provide a malicious path to trigger this vulnerability.

##### Tested Versions

ntp 4.2.8p2

##### Product URLs

<http://www.ntp.org>

##### Details

The function save\_config in the file ntp\_control.c will perform path sanitization by stripping out ‘\’ and ‘/’ from the filename provided to ensure that a user does not save files outside of the saveconfigdir that was previously configured.

```
if (strchr(filename, '\\') || strchr(filename, '/')) {
        snprintf(reply, sizeof(reply),
             "saveconfig does not allow directory in filename");
        ctl_putdata(reply, strlen(reply), 0);
        ctl_flushpkt(0);
        msyslog(LOG_NOTICE,
            "saveconfig with path from %s rejected",
            stoa(&rbufp->recv_srcadr));
        return;
    }

```

However on operating systems such as OpenVMS, directory separation is not done by using ‘\’ or ‘/’ but instead by characters such as ‘.’, ’-‘ and ‘:’.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

---

#### Known Vulnerabilities by Release Version

The following releases provided fixes for at least one security vulnerability. The table for each release provides an entry for each security issue (click its hyperlink to read the details for the vulnerability), indicates the issue’s severity, and provides the dates of advance notification to institutional members, advance release to premier and partner institutional members, and public release.

Refer to the [Release Timeline](https://www.ntp.org/dev/releasetimeline/) for a complete list of all releases, their public release dates, release announcements, and changelogs.

Last update: April 22, 2024 18:49 UTC ([7e7bd5857](https://git.nwtime.org/websites/ntpwww/commit/7e7bd5857f893277639b3765bf9347c4c6faa447))

| **Affects** | All ntp-4 releases running under VMS up to, but not including 4.2.8p4, and 4.3.0 up to, but not including 4.3.77. | Resolved in 4.2.8p4. |
| **CVSS2 Score** | 5.2, worst case | [AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:P/A:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator?calculator&version=2.0&vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:P/A:C)) |

---

#### Description

If `ntpd` is configured to allow remote configuration, and if the (possibly spoofed) IP address is allowed to send remote configuration requests, and if the attacker knows the remote configuration password or if `ntpd` was configured to disable authentication, then an attacker can send a set of packets to `ntpd` that may cause `ntpd` to overwrite files.

---

#### Mitigation

* Implement [BCP-38.](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page)
* Upgrade to [4.2.8p4 or later](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/).
* If you are unable to upgrade, remote configuration of NTF’s `ntpd` requires:
  + an explicitly configured “trusted” key. Only configure this if you need it.
  + access from permitted IP addresses. You choose the IPs.
  + authentication. Don’t disable it. Practice key security safety.
* If you use `ntpq` in scripts, make sure `ntpq` does what you expect in your scripts.
