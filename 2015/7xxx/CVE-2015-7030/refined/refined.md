- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A type conversion issue existed that could lead to conversions returning unexpected values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type conversion flaw.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Swift programs performing certain type conversions may receive unexpected values.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability would involve triggering specific type conversions in a Swift program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to execute a Swift program with specifically crafted type conversions.
