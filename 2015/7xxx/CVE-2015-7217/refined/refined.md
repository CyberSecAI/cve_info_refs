  "CVE-2015-7217": {
    "description": "The gdk-pixbuf configuration in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 on Linux GNOME platforms incorrectly enables the TGA decoder, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via a crafted Truevision TGA image.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the gdk-pixbuf library, specifically in the TGA decoder. This occurs because the library does not properly handle malformed TGA files with no colormap specified.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
          "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the affected application (e.g., Firefox) to crash. While the provided descriptions don't state arbitrary code execution, it should be noted that heap overflows can sometimes be exploited to achieve it. More specifically, the vulnerability causes a crash when the file picker is open in Firefox while attempting to render a malformed TGA image, where an attacker could use a specially crafted TGA file, to induce memory corruption via the scaling function in gdk-pixbuf.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted TGA image. This could be delivered through various channels where images are processed by Firefox, including websites.",
          "The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a folder with a malformed TGA file within its contents, in the Linux version of Firefox, when the file picker opens up for file selection purposes, or by opening the malformed file in the browser."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious TGA image. A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page, containing the malformed TGA image, to trigger the vulnerability.",
        "required_position": "The attacker needs no prior authentication or special privileges. The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable gdk-pixbuf TGA decoder attempts to process a specially crafted TGA image."
