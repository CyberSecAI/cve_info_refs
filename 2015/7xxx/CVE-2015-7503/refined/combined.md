### Security

## Security Advisory: ZF2015-10

# ZF2015-10: Potential Information Disclosure in Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey

`Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey` has a call to `openssl_public_encrypt()`
which uses PHP's default `$padding` argument, which specifies
`OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING`, indicating usage of PKCS1v1.5 padding. This padding has
a known vulnerability, the [Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12688/can-you-explain-bleichenbachers-cca-attack-on-pkcs1-v1-5),
which can be used to decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts.

### Action Taken

* `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey::encrypt()` was updated to accept an
  additional argument, `$padding`; the default value for this argument was set
  to `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.
* `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PrivateKey::decrypt()` was updated to accept an
  additional argument, `$padding`; the default value for this argument was set
  to `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.
* `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::encrypt()` was updated to accept an additional
  optional argument, `$padding`, allowing the user to specify the padding to use
  with `PublicKey::encrypt()`.
* `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa::decrypt()` was updated to accept an additional
  optional argument, `$padding`, allowing the user to specify the padding to use
  with `PrivateKey::decrypt()`.

The above changes represent a backwards-compatibility break, but were necessary
to prevent the outlined vulnerability. If you were using
`Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa` previously, you will likely need to re-encrypt any
data you've previously encrypted to use the new padding. This can be done as
follows:

```
$decrypted = $rsa->decrypt($data, $key, $rsa::MODE_AUTO, OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING);
$encrypted = $rsa->encrypt($data, $key); // Encrypted using OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING

```

The key may have a value of `null` in each of the examples above.

The following releases contain the fixes:

* Zend Framework 2.4.9
* zend-framework/zend-crypt 2.4.9
* zend-framework/zend-crypt 2.5.2

This advisory was given the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2015-7503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7503)

## Recommendations

If you use zend-crypt via either Zend Framework 2 or the
zendframework/zend-crypt package, and are using the RSA public key
functionality, we recommend upgrading to 2.4.9/2.5.2 immediately.
