Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding by default in the `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey::encrypt()` function. This padding is known to be susceptible to Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Padding Scheme:** The core vulnerability is the use of `OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING` (PKCS#1 v1.5) in RSA encryption, which is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attacks, specifically Bleichenbacher's attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use Bleichenbacher's chosen-ciphertext attack to decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information that was intended to be protected by RSA encryption.
*   **Private Key Recovery:** The Red Hat Bugzilla entry mentions that the vulnerable padding can be exploited to recover the RSA private key. This is a significant impact, as it compromises the security of the entire RSA key pair.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack:** The primary attack vector is a chosen-ciphertext attack, where an attacker crafts specific ciphertexts and observes the responses from the decryption process to gather information about the plaintext or the private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to send crafted ciphertexts to a system that is using the vulnerable `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey` class with the default padding.
*   The attacker needs to be able to observe or deduce the responses from the decryption process. This might involve monitoring error messages or observing timing differences.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects the `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa` component in Zend Framework 2.
*   The fix involves updating `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PublicKey::encrypt()` and `Zend\Crypt\PublicKey\Rsa\PrivateKey::decrypt()` to accept an additional `$padding` argument, with a default value of `OPENSSL_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`. This padding is more secure and mitigates the Bleichenbacher attack.
*   The changes are backwards-incompatible, requiring users to re-encrypt their previously encrypted data.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to Zend Framework 2.4.9 or zend-crypt 2.4.9/2.5.2, which contain the fixes.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Paragon Initiative Enterprises, and the patch was provided by Enrico Zimuel.
