Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MobaXterm application, prior to version 8.3, included an X11 server that listened on all IP addresses (port 6000) without requiring authentication for remote X11 connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication for remote X11 connections. This allows any remote system to connect to the X11 server.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The X11 server's default settings were too open, meaning access control was turned off.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Injection:** A remote attacker could inject X11 commands, which would be executed with the privileges of the user running MobaXterm. This is effectively arbitrary command injection.
*  **Information Disclosure**: A remote attacker could view existing X11 sessions, potentially exposing sensitive data displayed on the screen.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can silently connect to the X server and manipulate X11 applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network on port 6000.
*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can be located anywhere on the network as long as they can access the vulnerable host's port 6000.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target machine on port 6000.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No user credentials or authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of X11:** The attacker needs some understanding of the X11 protocol to inject commands.

**Additional details from content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Cert.org
*   MobaXterm version 8.3 addresses this issue by enabling access control by default and prompting the user to manually authorize each remote X11 connection
*   Securifera assigned the CVE number to the vulnerability after responsible disclosure and reporting it to CERT.org
*   The vulnerability allows for unauthorized disclosure/modification of information and allows for disruption of service
