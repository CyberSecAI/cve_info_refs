*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can read trace files containing technical information about the system. This could include sensitive data like system configurations, internal IP addresses, and potentially even passwords depending on system configurations.
*   **Facilitation of Further Attacks:** The disclosed information could be used to facilitate further attacks on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require local access.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the SAP HANA Web Dispatcher service over the network. They do not need any special privileges or to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
*   The specific affected component is SAP HANA DB 1.00.73.00.389160 (NewDB100_REL) (HANA 1.0 SPS09).
*   The vulnerability was addressed in SAP Security Note 2148854.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Juan Perez-Etchegoyen and Sergio Abraham of Onapsis Research Labs.
*   The CVSS v2 score is 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), and the CVSS v3 score is 5.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), which indicates a medium severity.
