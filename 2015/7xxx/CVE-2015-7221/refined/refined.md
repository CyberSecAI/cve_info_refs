{
  "CVE-2015-7221": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nsDeque::GrowCapacity` function in `xpcom/glue/nsDeque.cpp` does not properly check for integer overflows when calculating the new capacity of a deque.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow in size calculation, leading to undersized memory allocation, followed by memory corruption when writing to this buffer. Specifically, the multiplication of `theNewSize` by `sizeof(void*)` can cause an overflow on 32-bit architectures, leading to a smaller allocation than needed.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could trigger a deque size change that would lead to a denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution. Memory corruption can result in a crash or the ability to manipulate program execution by overwriting adjacent memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted Javascript code loaded in Mozilla Firefox to trigger an expansion of an nsDeque, which contains the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to open a web page containing crafted Javascript, i.e. from a remote network location."
