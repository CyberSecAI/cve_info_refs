Package        : zendframework
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5723

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Zend Framework, a PHP
framework:

CVE-2015-5723

    It was discovered that due to incorrect permissions masks when
    creating directories, local attackers could potentially execute
    arbitrary code or escalate privileges.

ZF2015-08 (no CVE assigned)

    Chris Kings-Lynne discovered an SQL injection vector caused by
    missing null byte filtering in the MS SQL PDO backend, and a similar
    issue was also found in the SQLite backend.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u4.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u4.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.12.16+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.16+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.

Subject: CVE Request: zendframework SQL injections

Hello,

the Zendframework project released the following advisory:

> ZF2015-08: Potential SQL injection vector using null byte for PDO (MsSql, SQLite)
<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2015-08>

The patch for the MS SQL backend seems to be:
<https://github.com/zendframework/zf1/commit/2ac9c30f73ec2e6235c602bed745749a551b4fe2>

but I couldn't find the fix for the mentioned SQLite backend.

This is somewhat related to CVE-2014-8089, which was about a similar issue
in the sqlsrv backend.

Can CVE(s) be assigned for these issues?

Thanks

It was pointed out to me that that patch also includes changes for the file
library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php, which is used by the SQLite backend.
So it should cover both MS SQL *and* SQLite.

This addresses the same issue as found in ZF2014-06, but within the PDO MsSql
adapter. Additionally, it fixes transaction tests for that adapter.

### Security

## Security Advisory: ZF2015-08

# ZF2015-08: Potential SQL injection vector using null byte for PDO (MsSql, SQLite)

The PDO adapters of Zend Framework 1 do not filter null bytes values in SQL
statements. A PDO adapter can treat null bytes in a query as a string
terminator, allowing an attacker to add arbitrary SQL following a null byte, and
thus create a SQL injection.

We tested and verified the null byte injection using `pdo_dblib` (FreeTDS) on a
Linux environment to access a remote Microsoft SQL Server, and also tested
against and noted the vector against `pdo_sqlite`.

## Action Taken

We added null byte filtering in the PDO abstract component
`Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Abstract`. We decided to use the abstract component to
prevent null byte injection in all the PDO adapters once we discovered the
situation was not specific to `pdo_dblib`.

We used the PHP's addcslashes to sanitize and properly quote null bytes:

```
$value = addcslashes($value, "\000\032");

```

The following releases contain the fixes:

* Zend Framework 1.12.16

## Recommendations

If you use one of the PDO-based adapters in Zend Framework 1, we recommend
upgrading to 1.12.16 immediately.

## Other Information

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

* Chris Kings-Lynne, who discovered and reported the issue against the
  `Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mssql` component of ZF1;
* [Enrico Zimuel](http://zimuel.it), who provided the patch.
