Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing null byte filtering in the PDO (PHP Data Objects) adapters of Zend Framework 1 when processing SQL statements. Specifically, the issue affects the MS SQL and SQLite backends.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of null byte filtering allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by inserting a null byte into a string that is later used in a database query. PDO adapters can treat null bytes as string terminators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker could execute malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches: Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Data modification: Alter or delete data within the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Gain higher level of access or control within the application's database.
    - Other malicious actions: Potentially use the database for further attacks on the application or the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries via the PDO adapters. This could be through form fields, URL parameters, or other input mechanisms that reach the database layer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject a null byte ( `\0` )  into the string that is used to create the SQL query.
- The attacker would need to be able to access an application using the vulnerable Zend Framework 1 with affected PDO adapters (MS SQL or SQLite).
- No special privileges are required beyond typical interaction with a web application.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding null byte filtering in the abstract PDO adapter (`Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Abstract`) using PHP's `addcslashes()` function.
- The fix was released in Zend Framework 1.12.16.
- The issue is similar to CVE-2014-8089, which was a related issue in the sqlsrv backend.
