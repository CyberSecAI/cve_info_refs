Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `ProgramBinary::linkAttributes` function in the ANGLE graphics library's `libGLES` module. This function, when used in Mozilla Firefox on Windows, does not properly manage shader attribute accesses. Specifically, it lacks a bounds check when writing to the `mShaderAttributes` array, a fixed-size array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The core issue is the absence of a check to ensure that the index accessing the `mShaderAttributes` array remains within the array's boundaries.
*   **Memory Corruption:** By bypassing this check, an attacker can overwrite memory beyond the allocated `mShaderAttributes` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can also lead to a denial of service by causing the application (Firefox) to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through crafted (1) OpenGL or (2) WebGL content. This means an attacker could host malicious content that, when rendered by a vulnerable version of Firefox, triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious content to the victim's browser.
*   **WebGL or OpenGL Knowledge:**  The attacker must have a working knowledge of WebGL or OpenGL to craft the malicious shader code.

**Additional Details from Content:**
* The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems.
* The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 41, Firefox ESR 38.3, and Seamonkey 2.38
* The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted WebGL/OpenGL content that causes out-of-bounds write on a fixed sized array `mShaderAttributes`.

**CVSS v2 Score:**

The provided SUSE information indicates a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 with the vector string `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P`. This translates to:

*   **Access Vector:** Network
*   **Access Complexity:** Low
*   **Authentication:** None
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial
*   **Integrity Impact:** Partial
*   **Availability Impact:** Partial
