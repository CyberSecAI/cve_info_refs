Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities in GLPI:

**Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of issues in the way GLPI handles file uploads during ticket creation:
    *   Predictable, non-randomized file names for uploaded files.
    *   Lack of restriction on uploaded file extensions.
    *   Temporary files are not deleted if an unauthorized extension is used.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Insecure file upload handling.
    *   Lack of proper sanitization and validation of file names and extensions.
    *   Failure to remove temporary files when they are not processed.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A malicious user can upload a PHP file containing malicious code.
    *   The uploaded PHP file can be accessed directly through the web server, and the server will execute the code.
    *   This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially compromising the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An authenticated user with the ability to create tickets can upload a malicious file as an attachment.
    *  The attacker directly accesses the uploaded file via its predictable path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An account on GLPI with the privilege to create new tickets.
    *   Ability to craft and upload a malicious file, such as a PHP file.
    * Knowledge of the upload path.

**Vulnerability 2: Privilege Escalation**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the user creation process. By intercepting and modifying the POST request during user creation, an attacker can assign the Super-Admin profile to a newly created user, bypassing the intended restrictions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Lack of server-side validation on user profile assignment during user creation.
    *   Reliance on client-side or request parameters for setting user privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Any user with the privilege to create new users can escalate their privileges or create a new Super-Admin user.
    *   Complete control over the GLPI instance.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An authenticated user with the ability to create new users.
    *   Intercepting the POST request used to create new users (`GLPI_ROOT/front/user.form.php`).
    *   Modifying the `_profiles_id` parameter to assign a super-admin profile.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An account on GLPI with the privilege to create new users.
    *   Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
    *   Knowledge of the `_profiles_id` parameter corresponding to the super-admin profile.
