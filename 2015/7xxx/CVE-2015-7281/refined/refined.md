  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ReadyNet WRT300N-DD router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as a victim user, provided the victim has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. If combined with default credentials, an attacker can establish an active session as part of an attack, thus not requiring a logged-in victim.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into making an unintentional request to the web server that will be treated as authentic.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to induce a victim with an active session to trigger a malicious request. If default credentials are in use, the attacker does not require a logged-in victim, and could establish an active session."
