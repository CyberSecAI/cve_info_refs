Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Horde Application Framework's web-based administration interface, specifically within the `/admin/cmdshell.php`, `/admin/sqlshell.php`, and `/admin/phpshell.php` scripts. These scripts failed to verify the source of HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352). The application does not validate the origin of the requests, leading to the possibility of malicious actions being performed on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this CSRF vulnerability allows a remote attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary system commands on the server via `/admin/cmdshell.php`
- Execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database via `/admin/sqlshell.php`
- Execute arbitrary PHP code on the server via `/admin/phpshell.php`
These actions can lead to unauthorized access to information, stored in the database, complete compromise of the application, and further attacks against application users and the company's infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious web page containing CSRF exploit code. A logged-in administrator is tricked into visiting this malicious page, which then sends forged HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts within the Horde Application Framework.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page containing the CSRF exploit.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the Horde Application Framework into visiting this malicious web page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application themselves, but needs a logged-in administrator to perform the actions

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- The vulnerability affects Horde Groupware versions 5.2.10 and prior.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Horde Groupware version 5.2.11.
- The issue is also fixed in php-horde packages: version 5.2.1+debian0-2+deb8u2 (stable distribution), and 5.2.8+debian0-1 (testing/unstable distributions)
- The vulnerability is considered high risk.
- The CVSSv3 base score is 8.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

The provided exploit code examples demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability in the `/admin/cmdshell.php`, `/admin/sqlshell.php`, and `/admin/phpshell.php` scripts.
