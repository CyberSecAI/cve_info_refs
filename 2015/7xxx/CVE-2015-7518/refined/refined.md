Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Foreman web interface. Specifically, user-provided data within the "smart class parameters" and "smart variables" description fields, as well as "source name" , "matcher" and "inherited value" in parameter overrides was not being sanitized. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts are injected into the database via parameter descriptions/variables, and later executed in the browsers of users who view pages containing this unsanitized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser. This could lead to various consequences:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to a user's Foreman account.
    - **Data Theft:**  Access sensitive data within the Foreman application.
    - **Phishing:** Display misleading or malicious content to trick users into revealing credentials or other sensitive information.
    - **Account Manipulation:** Alter user account settings and perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
    - **Defacement:** Modify web pages viewed by other Foreman users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Foreman web UI.
- **Parameter Editing:** An attacker with permission to edit Puppet class parameters, smart variables, or global parameters can insert malicious code into the description, source name, matcher or inherited value fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker requires authenticated access to Foreman with sufficient permissions to edit the parameters on hosts or hostgroups.
- **No Direct User Interaction Needed:** Once the malicious code is stored, it executes automatically when a victim user views the affected parts of the web UI (e.g., host/host group edit forms).

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability occurs within the information popups that display additional details of parameters on host and hostgroup edit forms.
- The source name, description and inherited value (1.11/develop branch only) are rendered using HTML without sanitization or escaping user-provided data.

**Additional Notes**
- Red Hat Satellite is also affected by this vulnerability as it incorporates Foreman as a core component.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Foreman 1.10.0
- The fix includes sanitizing the output rendered within the parameter popups.
- This CVE is associated with the Red Hat Bugzilla ID 1297040 and the Foreman Redmine issue ID 12611
