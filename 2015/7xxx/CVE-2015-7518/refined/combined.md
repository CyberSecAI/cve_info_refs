Red Hat Satellite engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on Satellite to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs will be migrated starting at the end of May. If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**Satellite project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SAT)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SAT-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Security process

We take security issues seriously and welcome responsible disclosure from researchers discovering vulnerabilities in Foreman. Please email foreman-security@googlegroups.com (a private address for the security team) with all reports. If you notice the security issue is related to a particular plugin, please mention the plugin within the body of the email to help us in routing the issue to the most authoritative source.

We will endeavour to resolve high severity issues in the current stable release and lower severity issues in the next major release. Announcements of security issues will be made on this page and in the [Release Announcements category of our community forums](https://community.theforeman.org/c/release-announcements/8) when a release containing a fix is available to end users and credit will be given to the researcher if desired.

The policy of the project is to treat all newly reported issues as private, and after evaluation, low to medium severity issues will be made public while high severity issues will be fixed under an embargo. Typically the project supports only one major (x.y) release at a time, though high severity issues may also be fixed in the previous release if it was only recently superseded.

### Disclosure details

#### CVE-2024-7923: Authentication bypass in Pulpcore

An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Pulpcore when
deployed by the Foreman Installer with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0.

This issue arises from the way Apache is configured to do certificate authentication and
pass this information to the Gunicorn backend,
without unsetting all headers coming from a possibly malicious client.

* Affects Katello 4.0.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 3.10.1, 3.11.2, 3.12.0
* GitHub PR [puppet-pulpcore#357](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulpcore/pull/357)

#### CVE-2024-7012: Authentication bypass in Foreman

An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when
deployed by the Foreman Installer with External Authentication.

This issue arises from the way Apache is configured to do certificate authentication and
pass this information to the Puma backend,
without unsetting all headers coming from a possibly malicious client.

* Affects Foreman 2.2.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 3.10.1, 3.11.2, 3.12.0
* GitHub PR [puppet-foreman#1181](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman/pull/1181)

#### CVE-2023-4886: World readable tomcat server.xml contains passwords

The world readable file `/etc/tomcat/server.xml` contains passwords for the keystore and truststore.
The actual stores are limited by file permissions, but `server.xml` should also be limited.

* Affects Katello
* Fix released in Foreman 3.8.0
* Redmine issue [#36760](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/36760)

#### CVE-2022-4130: Blind SSRF via Referer header

A blind site-to-site request forgery vulnerability was found in Satellite server.

#### CVE-2020-14335: World readable dhcp OMAPI secret could expose dhcp API access

OMAPI key used to secure dhcp API access could have been read by anyone with access to the hosting system.

*Mitigation:* override `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file mode to `0640` and ensure access to the file for user `foreman-proxy` by other means.

On Red Hat based systems, acls are used by default, so you need to only set less permissive mode and you should be set.
On Debian based systems, you need to install acls and set read access to the `/etc/dhcp` directory by acls.
To set correct acls install `acl` package and use `setfacl -R -m u:foreman-proxy:rx /etc/dhcp`.

In case the system may have been accessed locally by an un-trusted user, it may be prudent to change the OMAPI secret for dhcp.

* Affects foreman-proxy installations with dhcp feature protected by `dhcp_key_secret` since Foreman 1.0

To do so in a manner that survives reboot, update the file `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/foreman.conf`.

```
d /run/foreman 0750 foreman foreman -

```

For the change to have effect immediately run `systemd-tmpfiles --create`.

In case the system may have been accessed locally by an un-trusted user, it may be prudent to change any secrets stored in the settings, such as OAuth keys or remote execution passwords.

#### CVE-2016-8639: settings dropdown menus may run stored XSS in org/location name

If an organization or location is created with a name containing HTML, then the administrator-only Settings page will render the HTML as part of a dropdown menu.

This may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with HTML in the name is created, then an administrator attempts to change the default organization/location settings.

*Mitigation:* restrict permissions to organization and location creation, use the API or CLI instead to change the default organization/location settings.

*Note:* this CVE identifier has been assigned retrospectively, to describe a vulnerability that was fixed during a refactoring of the affected code.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.

#### CVE-2016-6319: Foreman form helpers do not escape JS when rendering label

Label parameter of all form helpers was not escaped allowing XSS (cross-site scripting). The Foreman itself did not contain exploitable code but other plugins that relied on form helpers could be vulnerable. One known vulnerable plugin is Remote Execution. All versions of this plugin are affected.

* Affects Foreman 1.6.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2
* Redmine issue [#16024](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16024)

#### CVE-2016-5390: API host interfaces data not restricted by view\_hosts filters

Non-admin users with the view\_hosts permission containing a filter are able to access API routes beneath âhostsâ such as GET /api/v2/hosts/secrethost/interfaces without the filter being taken into account. This allows users to access network interface details (including BMC login details) for any host.

The filter is only correctly used when accessing the main host details (/api/v2/hosts/secrethost). Access to the ânestedâ routes, which includes interfaces, reports, parameters, audits, facts and Puppet classes, is not authorized beyond requiring any view\_hosts permission.

* Affects Foreman 1.10.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15653](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15653)

#### CVE-2016-4995: information disclosure through unauthorized template previews

Users who are logged in with permissions to view some hosts are able to preview provisioning templates for any host by specifying its hostname in the URL, as the specific view\_hosts permissions and filters arenât checked.

If the organization or location features are enabled, the user will still be restricted to their associated orgs/locs.

* Affects Foreman 1.11.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.1 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15490](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15490)

#### CVE-2016-4475: Privilege escalation in Organization and Locations API and UI

When accessing Foreman as a user limited to specific organization or location, these are not taken into account in the API or parts of the UI. This allows a user to view, edit and delete organizations and locations they are not associated with if they have the requisite permissions.

*Mitigation:* make sure you have filters restricted to organizations or locations when you limit user by assigning them to particular organizations or locations.

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.12.0-RC3 and 1.11.4
* Redmine issue [#15268](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/15268)

* Redmine issue [#14931](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/14931)

#### CVE-2016-3693: application information leakage through templates

A provisioning template containing `inspect` will expose sensitive information about the Rails controller and application when rendered when using Safemode rendering (the default setting). This includes the application secret token, possibly permitting a privilege escalation.

Thanks to Ivan Necas for reporting the issue.

As a precaution, the security token may be regenerated with:

1. `chown foreman /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`
2. `foreman-rake security:generate_token`
3. `chown root /usr/share/foreman/config/initializers/local_secret_token.rb`

*Mitigation:* remove edit\_bookmarks and destroy\_bookmarks from untrusted users, remove private information from bookmark searches.

* Affects Foreman 0.3 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.11.0-RC2 and 1.10.3
* Redmine issue [#13828](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/13828)

#### CVE-2015-7518: parameter information popup allows stored XSS

The popup boxes next to global parameters, smart class parameters and smart variables on the host and host group edit forms can allow stored XSS to be executed in the browser from the parameter description etc.

*Mitigation:* do not click on the information popup box next to parameters in the host/group forms, and/or remove permission to edit Puppet classes from untrusted users.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0
* Redmine issue [#12611](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12611)

#### SQL injection via facts search terms

* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC3
* Redmine issue [#12458](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/12458)

#### CVE-2015-5282: parameter hide checkbox allows stored XSS during change

The parameter management UI has a checkbox to mark values as hidden to mask them from casual viewing. The checkbox that hides/shows the value fails to handle HTML properly and so is vulnerable to an XSS issue where HTML can be stored in a parameter, and executed by another user if they later tick/untick the hide box.

* Affects Foreman 1.7.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.10.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#11859](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11859)

#### CVE-2015-5246: Active Directory login works with old password after change

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that this was not a bug in Foreman, but a feature of Active Directory. It will remain assigned for future reference only. See [the Active Directory password changes](/manuals/latest/index.html#4.1.1LDAPAuthentication) section of the manual or [Microsoft KB906305](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/906305) for more details.*

When using an Active Directory instance to log into Foreman (via an LDAP authentication source), it is possible to log into Foreman for up to one hour after a password change in AD using the old password.

* Fix to Foreman not required, reconfigure Active Directory
* Redmine issue [#11471](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11471)

#### CVE-2015-5233: reports show/destroy not restricted by host authorization

Users with view\_reports or destroy\_reports permissions allows a user to view or delete reports from any host without taking their view\_hosts permission into account.

The reports list and other views combine the reports and hosts permissions to only show reports for hosts that a user can view, but the individual report show/delete pages and APIs do not apply the hosts permissions.

*Mitigation:* remove view\_reports and destroy\_reports permissions from users until a fix is available, or add a search query to the role filter to restrict it.

* Affects Foreman 1.5.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.1 and 1.8.4
* Redmine issue [#11579](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11579)

#### CVE-2015-5152: require\_ssl does not enforce HTTPS on API

The ârequire\_sslâ setting in /etc/foreman/settings.yml should enforce that web requests sent to Foreman over HTTP are redirected to HTTPS, but this was found not to happen with API requests (e.g. from Hammer CLI). Foreman will process API requests over HTTP, but should have redirected.

Redirection wonât help with credentials having already been sent, but should give some notification that the user/app is using the wrong URL.

*Mitigation:* add the following to the Apache HTTP VirtualHost, e.g. in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/05-foreman.d/api_request.conf`:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/api/(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/api/$1 [R,L]

```

* Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1

#### CVE-2015-3235: edit\_users permission allows changing of admin passwords

A user with the edit\_users permission (e.g. with the Manager role) is allowed to edit admin users. This allows them to change the password of the admin userâs account and gain access to it.

*Mitigation:* change roles of users with the edit\_users permission, remove the *Unlimited* flag and set a search query of `admin = false`.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.9.0-RC1
* Redmine issue [#10829](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10829)

#### CVE-2015-3199: Discovery: auto provision rule not enforcing org/locations

*This CVE identifier was assigned before realizing that no released versions of Foreman Discovery were affected. It will remain assigned for future reference only.*

The Foreman Discovery plugin auto provisioning rules do not enforce that the rule and the assigned host group are in the same organization and location. This can allow a rule to be configured with mismatched orgs/locations, and for another user who has access to the rule but not the host group, to run it and provision a host into a group in a different org/location to their own.

* Affects no released versions of Foreman Discovery
* Fix released in Foreman Discovery 4.0.0
* Redmine issue [#10469](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10469)

#### CVE-2015-3155: session cookie set without secure flag on HTTPS

The session cookie created when accessing the Foreman web UI over HTTPS is not set with the âsecureâ flag, which may lead to session hijacking.

If a user successfully logs into Foreman, then accesses Foreman over HTTP (which redirects to HTTPS, but with a window of opportunity), the session ID will be sent unencrypted and the session may be hijacked by an attacker.

* Affects all known Foreman versions
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.1
* Redmine issue [#10275](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10275)

#### CVE-2015-1844: users are not restricted to organizations/locations

When a non-admin user is associated to organizations or locations, their access is not correctly restricted. API access allows access to resources in any org/location, and UI access when the user is associated to more than one org/location is not restricted.

This allows users to read, edit and perform actions on resources (e.g. hosts) outside of the organizations or locations they have been assigned to.

* Affects Foreman 1.2.0 (TBC) and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.8.0-RC3 and 1.7.5
* Redmine issue [#9947](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/9947)

#### CVE-2015-1816: SSL certificate not verified on LDAP connections

When making an SSL connection to an LDAP authentication source in Foreman, the remote server certificate is accepted without any verification against known certificate authorities.

This can allow the LDAP connection between Foreman and the LDAP server to be attacked, and a different LDAP server could be contacted to authenticate users to Foreman.

* Affects Foreman 1.3.0 and higher
* Fix released in Foreman 1.7.4 and 1.8.0-RC2
* Redmine issue [#9858](https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/9858)

#### CVE-2014-3691: SSL certificate verification bypass in smart proxy

The smart proxy (foreman-proxy) fails to block connections when no client SSL certificate is supplied, instead permitting any request. Typically the smart proxy is configured to receive HTTPS requests with a client SSL certificate that is signed by the same CA (certificate authority) as its own, preventing unauthorized access to manage services such as DHCP, DNS and the Puppet CA.

It is strongly recommended to mitigate the problem by restricting access to the smart proxy. More information on [foreman-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/foreman-announce/jXC5ixybjqo).

## GPG keys

The Foreman project uses multiple GPG keys to sign packages and release artifacts. All stable releases will be signed by one of the keys. Nightly and plugin Debian packages will be signed, while nightly and plugin RPM packages will not (this may change in the future).

Signing for the Debian family of operating systems is via secure apt and more information, including verification steps can be found [on the Debian web site](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt#Debian_archive_key_expiry). RPMs themselves are signed and can be verified using `rpm --checksig PACKAGE`. All yum repository configs set up by foreman-release RPMs or the installer will enable GPG checking by default.

Key management is changing at the time of writing to cycle nightly keys every two years, and issue limited duration keys per stable release.

### Key changes in July 2014

In July 2014 after a server was compromised, the existing GPG key (0xE775FF07) was revoked and replaced with a new key (0x1AA043B8) as a precaution. All existing packages were re-signed with the new key and thereafter, new major releases are signed with new per-release keys.

All users with the old key trusted are urged to immediately disable this as follows:

* Debian users must run `sudo apt-key del E775FF07`
* RPM users must run `sudo rpm -e gpg-pubkey-e775ff07-4cda3cf9`

I would expect bookmark listing to display my\_bookmarks by default, similar to how the bookmark dropdown works.

I think you specifically mean other user's private bookmarks are visible, so updated. The page and public bookmarks should be accessible to any user.

Please report security issues first to foreman-security, don't just file them in Redmine. See <http://theforeman.org/security.html> and <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/foreman-dev/noN-XJ1qXgU/vYFPVYLQDQAJ> for more information. I will forward and start the CVE process myself.

There are further related issues with bookmarks, mostly coming from resource\_base not being adequately defined:

* UI edit action can render a form for a private bookmark by ID, if the user has edit\_permission.
* API index and get responses also shows private bookmarks from other users
* `update` and `destroy` actions of both the UI and API are not scoped to bookmarks that the user should have access to update, so they can supply an ID for a private bookmark of another user, the resource is found and updated. User needs edit/destroy\_bookmarks permission for this.

I've requested a CVE for this issue, we'll address it in the next release(s) following a patch being written.

Depends on the permissions assigned to your "Anonymous" role, which is a minimum set applied to all users.

The default changed some time ago and view\_hosts was removed. view\_bookmarks is assigned by default, so ensure yours matches the default seed (db/seeds.d/03-roles.rb).

The product content on Satellite main server (satellite6-ops.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/pulp/repos/RHEVM-QE-INFRA/Library/custom/RHEL_7_2_download_eng_tlv/RHEL_7_2_DEVEL) is different then on the capsule (<http://capsule-ops.eng.lab.tlv.redhat.com/pulp/repos/RHEVM-QE-INFRA/Library/custom/RHEL_7_2_download_eng_tlv/RHEL_7_2_DEVEL/>).  Tried to restart service on capsule with 'katello-service restart' and manually trigger the sync on Satellite with 'hammer capsule content synchronize --id 10'. Sync the product didn't help either. Both actions completed without a problem.  Actual results: different packages  Expected results: same packages  Additional info: Before was an issue syncing that product on capsule; it gave an error: "RuntimeError: Will not create a symlink to a non-existent source" The issue was resolved using the workaround from solution <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2069243>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1288855#c1)  Lukas Zapletal    2015-12-07 11:24:52 UTC  ``` I see many denials in the logs in the debug log.

Also, after review of the node sync logic, it's unclear how this could happen.  The sync logic only creates the content unit if the file is successfully downloaded.  Specifically to prevent this situation.  This raises the possibility that something unrelated to node sync is deleting the productid files.  In order to proceed with troubleshooting this, I really need a repeatable reproducer.

At one point, content from this custom repository was synchronized to the Satellite (and added to content view, published, etc) and successfully synchronized to the external capsule.  Later on, a re-sync of the same custom repository brought in newer versions of packages but apparently one or more of these new packages never got synchronized to the capsule.  Today we manually walked through the same steps, to see if we could get packages synced to the capsule, but we still don't see the new packages in the capsule.  There is a possibility that the sync process to the capsule was terminated before completion and I wonder if the metadata in the capsule is "up to date" and somehow the sync process 'thinks' that it doesn't need to do anything?   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1288855#c41)  Brian Bouterse    2016-03-07 23:18:50 UTC  ``` Removing the upstream Pulp bug.

**Description**

Reported by Tomer Brisker to foreman-security:

> I have discovered a stored XSS vulnerability in the host and hostgroup edit forms caused by smart class parameters and smart variables.
>
> These forms display a popover that shows additional info about any of the parameters that can be overridden. The popover is rendered with HTML but contains values that can be input by a user - the parameter description, and in develop branch also the inherited value.
>
> Effectively, any user who can edit parameters can input arbitrary HTML or JS into the description field or the default value, which will be executed once the popover is triggered by any other user.

This affects all versions of Foreman.

CVE identifier is CVE-2015-7518.

The patch fixes a few distinct XSS paths in the same information popups:

1. Source name in global parameters, e.g. the name of a host group (since [#7163](/issues/7163 "Feature: In host's edit page, show the source for the value of puppet class parameters (Closed)") in 1.7.0)
2. Description field in smart variables/class parameters (since 1.2 or earlier)
3. Matcher in smart variables/class parameter overrides (since 1.2 or earlier)
4. Inherited value in smart variables/class parameter overrides (1.11/develop only, not released)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Satellite 6.1.7 security, bug and enhancement fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0174)

## Topic

Updated Satellite 6.1 packages that fix one security issue, add one
enhancement, and fix several bugs are available for Satellite 6.1.7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
Security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a system management solution that allows
organizations to configure and maintain their systems without the
necessity to provide public Internet access to their servers or
other client systems. It performs provisioning and configuration
management of predefined standard operating environments.

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the smart
class parameters/variables field. By sending a specially crafted
request to Satellite, a remote, authenticated attacker could embed
HTML content into the stored data, allowing them to inject malicious
content into the web page that is used to view that data.
(CVE-2015-7518)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* New subscription rules for developer subscriptions caused manifest

imports into Satellite to fail. The subscription engine has been
updated to handle these new subscription rules correctly.
(BZ#1301812)

* A heavy load on content synchronization caused tasks to appear as

if they had not stopped. The content engine has been updated to
handle these messages with varying amounts of load. (BZ#1300811)

* Deleted directories in the /var/lib/pulp/ directory caused errors

related to "missing symlinks" during content synchronization. The
code has been updated to notice deleted directories, and recreate
them as necessary. (BZ#1288855, BZ#1276911)

* The networking API returned a JSON output which did not contain

the identifier of the interface. This data is critical for
scripting, and has been added to the API response. (BZ#1282539)

* When provisioning against Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization

(RHEV), the operating system information was not passed, causing
provisioning to fail. The interface to RHEV has been updated to
resolve this bug. (BZ#1279631)

* Incremental updates initiated from the command line were failing

with an "ID not found" error. The command line interface has been
patched to provide the correct ID, thus fixing this bug.
(BZ#1259057)

* Satellite used a large number of inodes when publishing a content.

The internal file handling has been improved to reduce the number of
symlinks and inodes required. (BZ#1244130)

* Provisioning on VMWare with multiple NICs was not handling labels

correctly. The interface to VMWare has been improved to handle this
situation correctly. (BZ#1197156)

* Previously, failed synchronization tasks on a Capsule which were

not reported correctly, and appeared as successful in the web UI.
The error handing logic has been improved to display the true state
of the task. (BZ#1215838)

* Satellite synchronized duplicate packages with the same epoch,

name, version, release, and architecture (ENVRA), but which were
signed by different checksums. This caused issues for clients
attempting to install from the repository. The code was updated to
respect the primary metadata, and only download a single package.
(BZ#1132659)

Users of Red Hat Satellite are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues
and add this enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

Subject: CVE-2015-7518: Foreman stored XSS in parameter information popup

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

CVE-2015-7518: Foreman is affected by a stored XSS vulnerability in
parameter information popups in the web UI.

Extra information stored on parameters inherited by hosts in Foreman
is shown in the web UI, in a popup for users.  The user-editable parts
of this information, such as a description, matcher and source name
can allow stored HTML/JS to be evaluated when a user opens the
information popup for a parameter.

Thanks to Tomer Brisker for reporting it to the foreman-security team,
and for fixing the issue.

Affects: at least Foreman 1.2.0 and higher (all modern versions)
Fix to be released in Foreman 1.10.0

Patch:
<https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/32468bce938067b1bbde1c20257>
71b5b83ce88ec
