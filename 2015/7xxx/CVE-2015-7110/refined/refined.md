Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7110:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption issue existed in the parsing of disk images. Specifically a Use-After-Free/Double-Free vulnerability due to lack of locking in `IOHDIXControllUserClient::clientClose`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** A flaw in how disk images are parsed leads to memory corruption.
- **Use-After-Free/Double-Free:** A race condition in `IOHDIXControllUserClient::clientClose` can cause a double free or use after free of a `vfs_context_t` object. This is due to lack of locking around the access and release of this object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** Triggering the double free or use-after-free can lead to a crash of the system

**Attack vectors:**
- **Disk Image Parsing:** Malicious disk images can be crafted to exploit the memory corruption issue.
- **Race Condition:** Exploiting the lack of locking in the `IOHDIXControllUserClient::clientClose` function requires a local attacker to trigger a race condition by closing the user client from two threads concurrently.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system. For the race condition attack vector, they also need the ability to create and close IOHDIXController user clients, which generally requires a specific system role or access to a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the use-after-free/double-free in `IOHDIXControllUserClient::clientClose`. The PoC involves creating a user client to `IOHDIXController`, then concurrently closing the user client from two different threads.
- The Apple security advisory describes the vulnerability as a memory corruption issue in the parsing of disk images, addressed through improved memory handling. The exploit-db entry provides significantly more details on the root cause of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.
- This vulnerability affects OS X El Capitan and tvOS.
