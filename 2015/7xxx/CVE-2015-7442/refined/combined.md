# Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in the IBM Installation Manager script (CVE-2015-7442)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Installation Manager "consoleinst.sh" script is subject to a vulnerability that may allow a local user to obtain administrative access.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-7442](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7442) There is a "/tmp" race condition in IBM's Installation Manager "consoleinst.sh" script that could allow a local user to obtain administrator access. If a local user can guess the PID of the installation script when executed by an administrator then they could place a malicious script in its place to be executed as root. Note that the Installation Manager "consoleinst.sh" script is only useful during a console mode install from a multi-CD/DVD disk set and it is not documented.

CVSS Base Score: 7.4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/108171> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM Installation Manager pre-1.8 versions 1.4.2 thru 1.7.4.3 and versions 1.8 through 1.8.3.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The "consoleinst.sh" script has a vulnerability and should not be used. Users who need to perform an install from multi-disk product media using the Installation Manager's console mode, can install the Installation Manager first and then perform the product multi-disk install as a second step:

1. Use the installc, userinstc, and groupinstc launchers with "-c" option, on the Install Packages page, uncheck everything but the IM offering and just install and/or update the Installation Manager offering.
2. After the step 1 install of the Installation Manager completes, launch the installed IM in console mode specifying the "install.xml" response file on the CD/DVD .

   e.g. "/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl -c -input <IM installkit location on CD/DVD>/install.xml"
