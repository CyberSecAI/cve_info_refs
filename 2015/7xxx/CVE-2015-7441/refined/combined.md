# Security Bulletin: Incorrect SSL/TLS handling in Remote Artifact Loader in IBM Business Process Manager Advanced and WebSphere Process Server

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM WebSphere Process Server and IBM Business Process Manager Advanced have a component "Remote Artifact Loader" (RAL) that allows access to artifacts contained in other applications. In remote access cases a HTTPS connection from the RAL client to the RAL server is established. This HTTPS connection does not honor the Application Server's configuration SSL /TLS connections.
