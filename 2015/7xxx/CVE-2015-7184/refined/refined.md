Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) specification within the `fetch()` API in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, when a `fetch()` request with `mode: 'no-cors'` and `credentials: 'include'` is redirected from a same-origin URL to a cross-origin URL, Firefox fails to properly apply response tainting, allowing access to the full response body. This bypasses the intended Same-Origin Policy (SOP) restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CORS Bypass:** The `fetch()` API incorrectly handles redirects in a `no-cors` context with credentials, allowing cross-origin access to resources.
*   **Missing Response Tainting:** When redirected from a same-origin URL to a cross-origin URL with credentials included, response tainting isn't applied, exposing the full response body instead of an opaque one.
*   **Inadequate Redirect Handling**: The fetch implementation did not properly recheck origins after a 302 redirect, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can bypass CORS restrictions and access sensitive data from other origins. This data includes user-specific information obtained through cookies and credentials.
*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can extract data from hidden input fields and access authenticated areas of websites through iframes, which should be blocked under normal circumstances.
*   **Full access to response body:** the vulnerability grants full access to response body for cross-origin requests when it is not intended.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **302 Redirect:** The attacker sets up a 302 redirect on their server which redirects to the target domain.
2.  **Crafted Page:** An attacker hosts a malicious page containing JavaScript code that utilizes the `fetch()` API with the vulnerable parameters. This page also includes two iframes: one with a direct cross-origin link (which is correctly blocked) and one that goes through a redirector.
3.  **User Interaction:** The user visits the attacker's crafted page.
4.  **Exploitation:** The second iframe loads the content of the target website, because it was redirected from a same-origin URL. Since response tainting is missing, the attacker can access the full body of the response and extract sensitive data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious HTML page and the 302 redirect.
*   **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious HTML page with JavaScript that uses the `fetch()` API to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is described as a critical security issue.
*   It affects Firefox versions 41 and 42. It was fixed in version 41.0.2.
*   The issue was independently reported by Abdulrahman Alqabandi and Ben Kelly.
*   The fix was implemented by backporting a modified version of the fix from bug 1184607.
*   The fix involves ensuring that redirected `fetch()` requests in `no-cors` mode return an opaque response when redirected to a cross-origin URL.
*   The vulnerability is specific to requests that include credentials.
*   The fix also involves re-introducing a preflight check on cross-origin redirects.
*   Patches were reviewed by multiple developers including Jonas Sicking, Ehsan Akhgari and Daniel Veditz.
