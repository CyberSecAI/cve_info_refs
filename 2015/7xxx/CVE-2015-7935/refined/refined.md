Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-7935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of filenames within the PHP program, allowing the inclusion of remote files. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to include malicious files from external sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion'):** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of file paths, allowing remote file inclusion.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Files can be accessed and downloaded without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to access and download files from the system. While the advisory doesn't explicitly state what type of files can be accessed, the nature of Remote File Inclusion suggests that it can include application configuration files, potentially exposing sensitive information
*   It is stated that an attacker could perform actions with the permissions of a valid user in the overview, this is likely due to the CSRF vulnerability detailed in CVE-2015-7936 and not directly from CVE-2015-7935.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, indicating that the attacker doesn't require physical access to the device.
*   **Network-Based Attack:** This is a network-based attack where an attacker sends specially crafted requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory states that an attacker with a low skill level could exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected system.
