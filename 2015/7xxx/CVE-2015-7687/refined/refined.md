Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7687:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition in the `lka_imsg()` function within the OpenSMTPD `PROC_LKA` process. This occurs in how the process handles `IMSG_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY` and `IMSG_MTA_SSL_VERIFY` messages related to SSL certificate verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Use-after-free:** The `PROC_LKA` process uses static pointers `req_ca_vrfy_smtp` and `req_ca_vrfy_mta` to store SSL verification request data. When it processes an `IMSG_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY` or `IMSG_MTA_SSL_VERIFY` message, it frees the memory associated with these pointers *without* setting them to NULL. It then relies on `PROC_PONY` to *always* send a new `IMSG_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY_CERT` or `IMSG_MTA_SSL_VERIFY_CERT` message (which would re-initialize these pointers) before sending subsequent chain messages (`IMSG_SMTP_SSL_VERIFY_CHAIN` or  `IMSG_MTA_SSL_VERIFY_CHAIN`). If `PROC_PONY` doesn't do this, `PROC_LKA` could access freed memory when handling chain messages, leading to a use-after-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the `PROC_LKA` process and, because other OpenSMTPD processes will then terminate, a denial of service.
*  **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability could be used to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the `_smtpd` user because the memory being freed could be controlled by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote attackers:** The vulnerability is triggered through the inter-process communication between `PROC_PONY` (which handles SMTP and MTA sessions) and `PROC_LKA` (which performs lookups and certificate verification).  Since `PROC_PONY` handles remote connections, this vulnerability is remotely triggerable.
*   **Malformed SSL certificate data:** An attacker can craft malicious SSL certificate data that, when processed by `PROC_PONY`, will cause it to send a sequence of messages to `PROC_LKA` that triggers the use-after-free. This is accomplished by sending an oversized certificate. This will cause the imsg to fail to send to PROC_LKA. Thus, PROC_LKA will process the verify message without having received a certificate message and will access freed memory.
* **Integer Truncation:**  The vulnerability is compounded by another issue that can cause the message with certificate data to be too large to send using the imsg API resulting in the verify message being processed without the certificate data message being received.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to an OpenSMTPD server that is configured to accept remote connections.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send data during the TLS handshake such that the server attempts SSL/TLS verification. This could involve the server attempting STARTTLS encryption.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SSL certificates and other data to trigger the specific sequence of messages required for the use-after-free and/or a large certificate that triggers the integer truncation issue.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during a code audit by Qualys Security.
*   The issue was fixed in OpenSMTPD version 5.7.2
*   The content also details a number of other vulnerabilities discovered during the audit that were resolved in the same release.

In summary, CVE-2015-7687 is a remotely exploitable use-after-free vulnerability in OpenSMTPD's SSL verification process that can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is related to improper memory management of SSL verification data between the `PROC_PONY` and `PROC_LKA` processes.
