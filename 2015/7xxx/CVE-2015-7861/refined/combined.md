## HP Client Automation and Radia Client Automation is vulnerable to remote code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#966927

Original Release Date: 2015-10-20 | Last Revised: 2017-08-14

---

### Overview

Radia Client Automation (previously sold under the name HP Client Automation) agent prior to version 9.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution.

### Description

| According to ZDI's advisory for [ZDI-15-363](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-363/), which has been assigned CVE-2015-7860:   *"**This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.* *The specific flaw exists within the Hewlett-Packard Client Automation agent. An attacker can send a large buffer of data to the agent which will cause a stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM.**"*  According to ZDI's advisory for [ZDI-15-364](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-364/), which has been assigned CVE-2015-7861:  *"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.*  *The specific flaw exists within the Hewlett-Packard Client Automation agent. An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the agent. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM."*  These vulnerabilities impact the Role-Based Access and Remote Notify features of HP Client Automation.Since 2013, the HP Client Automation software is now developed by Persistent Systems (and its subsidiary Accelerite) under the name [Radia Client Automation](http://www.persistent.com/Persistent-IP/Radia-Client-Automation). |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Accelerite previously released a [hotfix and advisory](https://support.accelerite.com/hc/en-us/articles/203659824) for this issue in previous versions of HP Client Automation and Radia Client Automation. Affected users may contact Accelerite for hotfix information.Persistent has addressed the issues in the latest build of Radia Client Automation version 9.1. Affected users are encouraged to update as soon as possible. |

## (0Day) Hewlett-Packard Client Automation Agent Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-364ZDI-CAN-3013

| CVE ID | [CVE-2015-7861](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-7861) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Client Automation](https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-10^9783_4000_100) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the Hewlett-Packard Client Automation agent. An attacker can send arbitrary commands to the agent. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  06/15/2015 - ZDI asked HP SSRT for a contact.06/15/2015 - HP SSRT advised ZDI that they had tried their known contacts and failed.06/25/2015 - ZDI wrote to Persistent requesting contact, but there was no reply.07/09/2015 - ZDI wrote to Persistent requesting contact, but there is no reply to date.  -- Mitigation:  Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.  -- Vendor Mitigation:  Guidelines to secure the remote notify feature:<https://support.accelerite.com/hc/en-us/articles/203659814-Accelerite-releases-solutions-and-best-practices-to-enhance-the-security-for-RBAC-and-Remote-Notify-features> |
