  "cve": "CVE-2015-7723",
  "description": "The userland portion of the fglrx-driver utilized by Xorg allows privilege escalation via symlink attacks on POSIX shared memory with insecure permissions.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The fglrx-driver calls shm_open() with insecure flags, specifically missing O_EXCL, allowing the Linux kernel to follow existing symlinks under /dev/shm. It then uses fchmod() to force permissions to 0666, potentially creating or modifying arbitrary files owned by root.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of shm_open() without O_EXCL flag",
      "Use of fchmod() to set insecure permissions of 0666 on files"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation. An attacker can create or modify arbitrary files owned by root with permissions 0666, potentially leading to system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Symlink attack on POSIX shared memory under /dev/shm",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in /dev/shm. This typically requires a local user account."

  "affected_versions": "fglrx-driver version 14.4.2",
    "fixed_versions": "fglrx-driver version 15.7"
