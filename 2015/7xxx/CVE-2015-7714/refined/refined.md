Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Realtyna RPL Joomla extension suffers from multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, input passed through various POST parameters is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present. The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of System Information: Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive system information.
- Exposure of Sensitive Information: Confidential data stored in the database can be exposed.
- Manipulation of Data: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Requests: Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoints.
- Multiple POST Parameters: Vulnerable parameters include `id`, `copy_field`, `pshow`, `css`, `tip`, `cat_id`, `text_search`, `plisting`, and `pwizard`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable Joomla extension is installed.
- No Authentication Required: The provided exploits do not appear to require authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Product: Realtyna RPL Joomla Extension.
- Affected Version: 8.9.2
- The vulnerability was discovered by Bikramaditya 'PhoenixX' Guha.
- Vendor patched the issue in version 8.9.5

The provided exploit examples include:

```
- option=com_rpl&view=addon_membership_members&format=edit&id=84'
- option=com_rpl&view=property_structure&format=ajax&function=new_field&id=3004'&type=text
- option=com_rpl&view=rpl_multilingual&format=ajax&function=data_copy&copy_field=308'&copy_from=&copy_to=en_gb&copy_method=1
- option=com_rpl&view=property_structure&format=ajax&function=update_field&id=3002&options=0&css=&tip=&style=&name=&cat_id=1&text_search=0&plisting=0&pshow=1'&pwizard=1&mode=add
```

These examples demonstrate how various parameters can be manipulated to inject SQL code.
