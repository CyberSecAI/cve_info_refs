{
  "cve": "CVE-2015-7312",
  "description": "The Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition in the msync() system call, and a similar bug in the madvise_remove() function, were introduced by a patch provided by the aufs project to correct behaviour of memory-mapped files from an aufs mount.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.",

      "Local exploitation"
