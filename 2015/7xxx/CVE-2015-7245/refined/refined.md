Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper input validation in the web interface of the D-Link DVG-N5402SP router, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The device is vulnerable to a file path traversal vulnerability. By manipulating the `errorpage` parameter in the HTTP request, an attacker can access arbitrary files on the device's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the device's file system, potentially including configuration files, password hashes, or other confidential information. In the provided example, the `/etc/shadow` file is accessed, which contains user password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint. The attacker includes a manipulated `errorpage` parameter that contains a path traversal sequence (`../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow`) in order to access the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web management interface of the vulnerable D-Link DVG-N5402SP device, typically on port 8080.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any prior authentication.
