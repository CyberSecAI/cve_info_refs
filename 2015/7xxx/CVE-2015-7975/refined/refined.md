Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `nextvar()` function within the `ntpq` utility copies data into a buffer without properly validating the length of the input against the maximum buffer size (256 bytes).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `memcpy()` within `nextvar()` copies data into a buffer without a length check, leading to a buffer overflow if the input data exceeds the buffer's capacity.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of input length validation before the `memcpy()` is the core flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common consequence is a crash of the specific `ntpq` instance due to the buffer overflow. If `ntpq` runs with elevated privileges (e.g., as root), the impact is potentially more serious.
*   While not explicitly mentioned, depending on the specific memory layout on the system, other negative impacts could occur.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input to the `ntpq` utility. If an attacker can control an input into `ntpq` this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   **Script-Based Attacks:** If `ntpq` is used within scripts that obtain variable names from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, environment variables), it can be exploited by an attacker that can control that input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the ntpq utility through, for example, command line arguments or environment variables.
*   No specific network position is required, but if ntpq runs with root privileges this vulnerability is potentially more dangerous.
*   The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically in the `ntpq` client, not the `ntpd` server itself.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in `ntp-4.2.8p6` and later releases.
*   The fix included adding a check against the buffer maximum size.
*   The advisory from support.ntp.org notes that `ntpq` running as root may have a more severe impact.
