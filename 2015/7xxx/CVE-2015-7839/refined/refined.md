Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-7839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw found within the traceroute functionality of Solarwinds Log and Event Manager (LEM). Specifically, it resides in requests to `/services/messagebroker/nonsecurestreamingamf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable LEM installations.
*   **Agent Compromise:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on all managed computers using the LEM agent connected to the Log and Event Manager.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This effectively means the attacker can gain full control of the affected systems by executing commands under the context of the agent application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Specific URI:** The attack targets the `/services/messagebroker/nonsecurestreamingamf` URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not need local access to the affected system.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** No specific authentication credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Solarwinds LEM installation.

**Additional Information:**

*   Solarwinds released an update to address the vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected via a Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '19491'.
