Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type confusion flaw within the Adobe Flash Player's handling of `IExternalizable.writeExternal`. When this method is overridden with a non-function value, Flash Player incorrectly assumes it is a function, leading to a memory corruption due to a 'method' call outside of the ActionScript object's ActionScript vtable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is in the lack of proper type checking when handling the `writeExternal` method, leading to a type confusion vulnerability.
*   **Use-after-free:** Multiple sources indicate this CVE is related to a use-after-free vulnerability that could lead to code execution, specifically affecting version 11.2.202.535. This is further described in the description from bugzilla.suse.com_864f84c3 and multiple other sources.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The type confusion directly leads to memory corruption due to the incorrect handling of the overridden `writeExternal` member.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the Flash Player process.
*   **Denial of Service:** Some sources mention the possibility of a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as a result of the vulnerability.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Some sources indicate that in addition to code execution, sensitive information could also be obtained.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted SWF File:** The primary attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted SWF (Shockwave Flash) file to a user.
*   **Web Browsers:** This crafted SWF can be delivered via malicious websites or compromised web pages that users visit using browsers with vulnerable versions of Adobe Flash Player.
*  **Email:** Some documents refer to a "Pawn Storm" campaign exploiting this flaw suggesting emails with malicious links or attached SWF content were also used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious SWF file to a user's machine remotely.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication
*  **Exploit Development:** It requires technical knowledge to develop a specific exploit targeting this memory corruption or use-after-free vulnerability by leveraging an overridden `writeExternal` method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was actively being exploited in targeted attacks at the time of discovery.
*   The vulnerability is mentioned as part of the "Pawn Storm" campaign (also known as APT28) in some reports.
*   Adobe has released updates to address this vulnerability (version 11.2.202.540 on Linux and 18.0.0.252 and 19.0.0.207 on other platforms), so updating the flash plugin is the best mitigation.
