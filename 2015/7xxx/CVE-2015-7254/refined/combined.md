# Security Advisory - Path Traversal Vulnerability in Huawei Home Gateway Products

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20151124-01-HomeGateway
* Initial Release Date:
  Nov 24, 2015
* Last Release Date:
  Nov 11, 2016

Summary

There is a path traversal vulnerability on several Huawei home gateway products. The products do not properly validate HTTP requests received by a specific port. An remote attacker may access the local files on the device without authentication by crafting an HTTP request and sending it to the specific port. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2015-09006)

This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2015-7254.

Huawei has released software updates to fix these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

<http://www.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-advisories/hw-462908.htm>

Software Versions and Fixes

| Product Name | Affected Version | Resolved Product and Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HG532e | Versions earlier than V100R001C02B017 | V100R001C02B017 |
| WS318-10 | Versions earlier than V100R001C01B022 | V100R001C01B022 |
| WS550-10 | Versions earlier than V100R001C01B019 | V100R001C01B019 |

Impact

Attackers may access the local files on the device without authentication.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system (http://www.first.org/cvss/).

Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/P:C/I:N/A:N)

Temporal Score: 4.1 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

Technique Details

1. Prerequisite:

The attacker gains access to the network of the device.

2. Attacking procedure:

An attacker may craft an HTTP request and send it to a specific port on the device. The device does not properly validate the packet. By exploiting this vulnerability, the remote attacker can launch the path traversal attack and access the local files on the device, but the attacker cannot perform modify or delete operation.

Temporary Fix

None

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Huawei HG532 routers contain a path traversal vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#438928

Original Release Date: 2015-11-06 | Last Revised: 2015-11-09

---

### Overview

Huawei HG532 routers, including the HG532e, n, s, and possibly other models, are vulnerable to arbitrary file access through path traversal.

### Description

| [**CWE-22**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2015-7254  In vulnerable Huawei router models, the /icon/ path of requests to Internet-facing TCP port 37215 can be manipulated to gain access to arbitrary files. For instance, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could read the inittab file by directly requesting http://<target\_IP>:37215/icon/../../../etc/inittab. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A LAN-based attacker can access arbitrary files on vulnerable devices. Note that in some configurations, an external attacker may be able to leverage this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor is in the process of releasing [firmware updates](http://www1.huawei.com/en/security/psirt/security-bulletins/security-notices/hw-460507.htm) to carriers to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to contact their carrier to obtain the latest release, but should consider the following workaround when a patch is unavailable. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. |
