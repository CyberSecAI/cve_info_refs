    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect implementation of cryptographic algorithms and parameters in SAP Mobile Platform's DataVault API.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of cryptographic algorithms, which allows an attacker to recover the keystream used for data encryption. Also, the lack of cryptographic integrity mechanisms in the DataVault API enables the attacker to modify data.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to a vulnerable mobile device could decrypt credentials and other sensitive information stored within the DataVault. This could potentially grant the attacker access to other business systems. The attacker can also modify previously encrypted values within the DataVault.",
        "Attack vectors": "Local access to a vulnerable mobile device.",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs physical or logical access to the mobile device running the vulnerable SAP Mobile Platform ClientHub application. No authentication is required."
