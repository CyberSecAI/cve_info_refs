    * Vulnerability Class: Missing Required Cryptographic Step (CWE-325)
    * Remotely Exploitable: No
    * Locally Exploitable: Yes
    * Authentication Required: No
    * Original Advisory:
<https://www.onapsis.com/research/security-advisories/SAP-Mobile-Platform-DataVault-Keystream-Recovery>

4. Affected Components Description
- ----------------------------------

The SAP Mobile Platform 3.0 SP5 has an API called DataVault, which is
used to securely store data on mobile devices. As described by SAP AG
"[...] The DataVault APIs provide a secure way to persist and encrypt
data on the device. The data vault uses AES-256 symmetric encryption of
all its contents. The AES key is computed as a hash of the passcode
provided and a =E2=80=98salt=E2=80=99 value that can be supplied by the
device
application developer, or automatically generated through the API [...]"

5. Vulnerability Details
- ------------------------

Due to an incorrect implementation of the cryptografic algorithms and
parameters, it is possible to recover the keystream for the encrypted
data. As a result, it is possible to recover part of the plaintext
corresponding to an encrypted piece of data thus reverting the
encryption process of some values inside the DataVault without needing
the original secret key.

Furthermore, due to the lack of cryptographic integrity mechanisms in
the SAP DataVault an attacker recovering this keystream has the
possibility of re-encrypting (or modifying in practical terms) with some
limitations, some values previously encrypted inside the DataVault.

6. Solution
- -----------

Implement SAP Security Note 2094830.
