Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-7924:

**CVE-2015-7924: Weak Session Management**

*   **Root Cause:** The eWON software's log-off function does not properly terminate the session on the client browser.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient session expiration. The session remains active in the browser even after the user logs off, until the browser is closed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious party can use the same browser session to continue interacting with the device without needing to re-authenticate. This allows unauthorized access to the device's functions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote exploitation via a user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the same browser that was used to log into the eWON device or somehow manipulate the active session, and needs to have a valid login to the eWON device initially.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "by design," meaning the session is only destroyed when the browser is exited.
*   The vendor (eWON) has addressed this vulnerability in a firmware update.

**Other vulnerabilities identified in the provided content related to eWON devices (but not CVE-2015-7924):**

*   **CVE-2015-7925: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF tokens in the eWON web application.
    *  **Vulnerabilities:** The application does not use CSRF tokens, enabling an attacker to perform unwanted actions on the trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute any application function silently with the permissions of the victim user if they have an active session, potentially including firmware uploads, device reboots, or configuration deletion.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Remote exploitation via a web browser.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request. The attacker needs to know the eWON IP. The vendor initially did not see this as a problem since connections to the device were supposed to be made through a VPN, point-to-point LAN, or a secure LAN, but this does not take into account publicly exposed portals or devices.
*   **CVE-2015-7926: Weak RBAC Controls**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper privilege handling that allows unauthenticated or low-privileged users to access sensitive information and perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper access control that allows unauthenticated users to gather status of I/O servers through a forged URL, and perform actions like reading, updating, and deleting I/O servers and configurations even with low privileged users. It was also possible to enumerate and delete all users.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of I/O server parameters, deletion of users and enabling/disabling of I/O servers which may lead to device disruption or complete loss of control.
    *  **Attack Vectors:**  Remote exploitation by crafting malicious URL requests.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated or have low privileged access.
*   **CVE-2015-7927: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation, which allows the injection of malicious scripts into the web application.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** The application does not sanitize input fields (e.g., user first name, last name, tag descriptions, etc.) allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and active content, such as JavaScript, ActiveX, and VBScript.
    *  **Impact of Exploitation:**  Malicious scripts can be executed on the browser of other users of the eWON device, potentially leading to session hijacking, network reconnaissance, or deployment of backdoor programs.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Remote exploitation by injecting malicious code through various input fields
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to input malicious scripts via a web interface. This vulnerability can also be triggered via FTP upload because everything is saved in the eWON config files.
*   **CVE-2015-7928: Passwords Not Secured**
    *  **Root Cause**: Passwords transmitted in plain text over the network and stored insecurely.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Passwords are not encrypted, making them susceptible to retrieval from network traffic. The autocomplete feature in some eWON forms also exposes passwords.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** If credentials are compromised it would allow unauthenticated access.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Network sniffing, browser-based password retrieval.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic or access the browser data of a user of the eWON device.
*   **CVE-2015-7929: POST/GET Issues**
    *   **Root Cause:** The eWON web server allows the use of the less secure GET method instead of POST for sending data.
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Data transmitted via GET is part of the URL which could be logged or exposed.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Sensitive data can be exposed via URL. This could potentially lead to CSRF.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Remote exploitation by sending requests via GET.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attacker needs access to the network.

In summary, the content describes several vulnerabilities in eWON industrial routers, and CVE-2015-7924 is one of them, which is caused by weak session management. The vendor has addressed some of these issues with firmware updates but has not fixed others, especially those related to CSRF, XSS, insecure passwords, and the use of GET instead of POST for data transmission.
