Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control on a SQL query execution functionality within ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted SQL Query Execution:** Authenticated users, including the default "guest" account, can execute arbitrary SQL queries directly on the underlying Postgres database.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied SQL queries.
- **Bypass of Access Restrictions:** Although direct `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries are restricted, this can be bypassed by prepending a `SELECT` query (e.g. `SELECT 1;INSERT INTO ...`).
- **Privileged Database Access:** The Postgres database runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows, allowing file system writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges. This is achieved by:
    - Using SQL to create a large object.
    - Inserting a JSP payload into the large object.
    - Exporting the large object to a JSP file in the web application's directory.
    - Accessing the JSP file to execute the payload.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Full control over the server is possible, leading to data breaches, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network through the web interface of ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious POST requests to `/event/runQuery.do`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer.
- **Authentication:** While the default 'guest' account is vulnerable, any authenticated user can execute SQL queries, hence low privilege access will suffice.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker needs to know that sending a POST request with `execute=true&query=<sql query>` to `/event/runQuery.do` is possible even if not exposed in the web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer versions 10.6 build 10060 and previous versions.
- A Metasploit module is available to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
- A patch was released by ManageEngine to address this vulnerability.

The provided information provides more technical details than the standard CVE description, including specific steps of exploitation and the method of bypassing the restriction for INSERT/UPDATE queries.
