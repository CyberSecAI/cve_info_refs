# ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer Remote Code Execution

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer Remote Code Execution

Disclosed
07/11/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a SQL query functionality in ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer v10.6
build 10060 and previous versions. Every authenticated user, including the default "guest"
account can execute SQL queries directly on the underlying Postgres database server. The
queries are executed as the "postgres" user which has full privileges and thus is able to
write files to disk. This way a JSP payload can be uploaded and executed with SYSTEM
privileges on the web server. This module has been tested successfully on ManageEngine
EventLog Analyzer 10.0 (build 10003) over Windows 7 SP1.

#### Author(s)

* xistence <xistence@0x90.nl>

#### Platform

Windows

#### Architectures

x86

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/misc/manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/misc/manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/misc/manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce
msf exploit(manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(manageengine_eventlog_analyzer_rce) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

# ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer SQL query execution

---

*From*: xistence <xistence () 0x90 nl>

*Date*: Mon, 14 Sep 2015 08:41:24 +0700

```
Exploit Title: ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer SQL query execution
Product: ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer
Vulnerable Versions: v10.6 build 10060 and previous versions
Tested Version: v10.6 build 10060 (Windows)
Advisory Publication: 14/09/2015
Vulnerability Type: authenticated SQL query execution
Credit: xistence <xistence[at]0x90.nl>

Product Description
-------------------

EventLog Analyzer carry out logs analysis for all Windows, Linux and Unix
systems, Switches and Routers (Cisco), other Syslog supporting devices, and
applications like IIS, MS SQL. Eventlog analyzer application is capable of
performing real-time log file analysis. Event log files analyzer
application can carry out log file analysis of imported files. The files
can be imported from the archive or from any machine.

When an important security event is generated on a machine in the network,
event log file analyser application collects, performs log analysis and
displays the event on the EventLog Analyzer Dashboard, in real-time. The
event log report is generated from the analyzed event logs. From the event
log reports (graphs), you can drill down to the raw log events and do a
root cause analysis within minutes, and then focus on resolving it.

The logging analyser application carry out imported and archived log files
analyses to fulfill the requirements of forensic analysis and event log
audit. The forensic and audit reports can be generated from the analyzed
logs.

Vulnerability Details
---------------------

Every user has the ability to execute SQL queries through the
"/event/runQuery.do" script, including the default "guest" user. (The SQL
query option is just not visible in the web interface)
Below is the POST request, executed as "guest":

POST /event/runQuery.do HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.116:8400
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: JSESSIONID=XXXXXXXXXX
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 39

execute=true&query=select+version%28%29

Access to queries starting with "INSERT" or "UPDATE" is denied by default,
however this can be bypassed by doing a select query first, like this:

"SELECT 1;INSERT INTO ..."

The included Postgres backend is running with SYSTEM privileges on Windows,
allowing to write files to disk with these privileges.

A Metasploit exploit module will be released shortly.

Solution
--------
ManageEngine has provided a patch to fix this issue, the steps to apply/fix
this are as below:

1. Stop the ELA service.
2. Download the zip from
<http://bonitas2.zohocorp.com/zipUploads/2015_14_07_17_52_30_o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61.tar.gz>
and extract the folders. You would have two folders "EventLogAnalyzerJSP"
and "LogAnalyzerClient"  under "o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61". Copy these
two folders and place it under <ELA Home>//lib/ folder.
3. The path of the following files would be as below:

runQuery_jsp.class --> <ELA
Home>\\lib\\EventLogAnalyzerJSP\\com\\adventnet\\sa\\jsp\\WEB_002dINF\\jsp
RunQuery.class --> <ELA Home>\\lib\\LogAnalyzerClient\\com\\adventnet\\la\

4. Restart the ELA service and check for the issue.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Exploit Title: ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer SQL query execution
Product: ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer
Vulnerable Versions: v10.6 build 10060 and previous versions
Tested Version: v10.6 build 10060 (Windows)
Advisory Publication: 14/09/2015
Vulnerability Type: authenticated SQL query execution
Credit: xistence <xistence[at]0x90.nl>

Product Description
-------------------

EventLog Analyzer carry out logs analysis for all Windows, Linux and Unix
systems, Switches and Routers (Cisco), other Syslog supporting devices, and
applications like IIS, MS SQL. Eventlog analyzer application is capable of
performing real-time log file analysis. Event log files analyzer
application can carry out log file analysis of imported files. The files
can be imported from the archive or from any machine.

When an important security event is generated on a machine in the network,
event log file analyser application collects, performs log analysis and
displays the event on the EventLog Analyzer Dashboard, in real-time. The
event log report is generated from the analyzed event logs. From the event
log reports (graphs), you can drill down to the raw log events and do a
root cause analysis within minutes, and then focus on resolving it.

The logging analyser application carry out imported and archived log files
analyses to fulfill the requirements of forensic analysis and event log
audit. The forensic and audit reports can be generated from the analyzed
logs.

Vulnerability Details
---------------------

Every user has the ability to execute SQL queries through the
"/event/runQuery.do" script, including the default "guest" user. (The SQL
query option is just not visible in the web interface)
Below is the POST request, executed as "guest":

POST /event/runQuery.do HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.116:8400
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: JSESSIONID=XXXXXXXXXX
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 39

execute=true&query=select+version%28%29

Access to queries starting with "INSERT" or "UPDATE" is denied by default,
however this can be bypassed by doing a select query first, like this:

"SELECT 1;INSERT INTO ..."

The included Postgres backend is running with SYSTEM privileges on Windows,
allowing to write files to disk with these privileges.

A Metasploit exploit module will be released shortly.

Solution
--------
ManageEngine has provided a patch to fix this issue, the steps to apply/fix
this are as below:

1. Stop the ELA service.
2. Download the zip from
http://bonitas2.zohocorp.com/zipUploads/2015_14_07_17_52_30_o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61.tar.gz
and extract the folders. You would have two folders "EventLogAnalyzerJSP"
and "LogAnalyzerClient"  under "o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61". Copy these
two folders and place it under <ELA Home>//lib/ folder.
3. The path of the following files would be as below:

runQuery_jsp.class --> <ELA
Home>\\lib\\EventLogAnalyzerJSP\\com\\adventnet\\sa\\jsp\\WEB_002dINF\\jsp
RunQuery.class --> <ELA Home>\\lib\\LogAnalyzerClient\\com\\adventnet\\la\

4. Restart the ELA service and check for the issue.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
