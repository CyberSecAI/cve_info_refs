      "Cve ID": "CVE-2015-7216",
      "Cve Description": "The gdk-pixbuf configuration in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 on Linux GNOME platforms incorrectly enables the JasPer decoder, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted JPEG 2000 image."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to the incorrect enabling of the JasPer decoder in the gdk-pixbuf configuration in Mozilla Firefox on Linux GNOME platforms.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The JasPer decoder, which was enabled in the gdk-pixbuf configuration, is unmaintained and has known vulnerabilities.",
        "The lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the JasPer library allows for malformed images to trigger a crash."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service, possibly leading to unspecified other impacts, via a crafted JPEG 2000 image, by crashing the Linux file chooser.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through a crafted JPEG 2000 image.",
        "The image needs to be processed by the JasPer decoder, which is triggered through the gdk-pixbuf library when a user attempts to preview or open such a file using the Linux file chooser."
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create a crafted JPEG 2000 image that exploits the vulnerability in the JasPer decoder.",

      "Cve ID": "CVE-2015-7217",
      "Cve Description": "The gdk-pixbuf configuration in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 on Linux GNOME platforms incorrectly enables the TGA decoder, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) via a crafted Truevision TGA image."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect enabling of the TGA decoder in gdk-pixbuf within Mozilla Firefox on Linux GNOME platforms, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when handling malformed TGA images.",

      "Attack Vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through malformed Truevision TGA images.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered through the TGA decoder, which is enabled by default within gdk-pixbuf and used by Firefox on Linux systems when rendering thumbnails or images in the file chooser.",
         "Opening or attempting to preview the crafted TGA file triggers the vulnerability."

    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability lies in an integer overflow within the MPEG4Extractor::readMetaData function of libstagefright when parsing MP4 video files on 64-bit platforms.
