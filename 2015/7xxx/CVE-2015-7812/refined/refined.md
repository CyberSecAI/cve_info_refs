Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Early versions of Xen on ARM did not fully support "multicall" functionality (executing multiple operations in a single hypercall).
- Initial implementations had stubs for multicall preemption, which crashed the host when triggered.
- When multicall support was added, these stubs were not replaced with correct functionality, leaving the vulnerability exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of preemptable hypercalls issued through the multicall interface.
- Stubs for functionality were not replaced with correct functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest can crash the Xen host. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A guest can trigger the vulnerability by issuing a preemptable hypercall via the multicall interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a Xen guest. This includes guest users and administrators, unless the host limits their privileges.
- No special privileges within the guest are explicitly required. The ability to make hypercalls is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM systems running Xen versions 4.4 onwards.
- x86 systems are not affected.
- A patch is available to resolve the issue.
- Mitigations involve running guest kernels that don't use multicall functionality, or by preventing guests from loading code into the kernel or using other kernel-privilege escalation methods.
