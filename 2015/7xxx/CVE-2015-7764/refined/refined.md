Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of a static Initialization Vector (IV) in the encryption process within the `sqlalchemy-utils` library, specifically in its `EncryptedType`. When encrypting data using AES in CBC mode, the library derives the IV by taking the first 16 bytes of the SHA256 hash of the encryption key. This IV remains constant for every encryption operation using the same key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Static IV:** The primary weakness is the use of a static IV. In CBC mode, using the same IV with the same key for multiple encryption operations compromises the confidentiality of the encrypted data.
*   **Predictable IV:** The IV, being a hash of the key, is predictable.
*   **Lack of Randomness:**  The IV is not randomly generated, rendering the encryption susceptible to certain cryptographic attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reduced Confidentiality:**  An attacker could potentially decrypt data encrypted with the same key if they can observe multiple ciphertexts encrypted with the same IV.
*   **Known-Plaintext Attacks:** The predictability of the IV can enable an attacker to conduct known-plaintext attacks. If an attacker knows or can guess a portion of plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, they can deduce patterns and potentially decrypt other data encrypted using the same key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Observing multiple encryptions:** The attacker needs to be able to observe multiple encryptions using the same key, in order to perform cryptanalysis.
*   **Known or guessed plaintext:** If an attacker can obtain or guess the plaintext of an encrypted message and the corresponding ciphertext they can use this information to break the encryption for other encrypted data using the same key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to ciphertext:** The attacker needs to be able to access and observe multiple ciphertexts produced using the vulnerable encryption scheme with the same key.
*   **Cryptanalysis skills:**  The attacker needs to have knowledge of cryptographic attacks, specifically those that target CBC mode encryption with static IVs.
*   **Knowledge of the encryption key:** While not strictly necessary for all attacks, knowledge of the key (or ability to guess part of it) would greatly aid an attacker.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in the context of Netflix's Lemur tool, which uses `sqlalchemy-utils` for data encryption.
*   The issue was addressed in `sqlalchemy-utils` with the addition of  randomly generated IVs for encryption operations.
*   The CVE was assigned to Lemur 0.1.4 because they were not aware of the issue, and had selected a library that did not offer the expected random-IV behavior.
