Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a race condition in the `rds_sendmsg` function within the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the check to see if a socket is bound uses the `rs_bound_addr` field *without* acquiring a lock. This lack of locking leads to a race condition where `rs_bound_addr` may be set temporarily while the underlying transport is *not* fully initialized in `rds_bind()`. Subsequently, when `__rds_conn_create()` is called, it attempts to dereference the `trans` pointer before it is initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to the `rs_bound_addr` field without proper locking allows for the race.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The lack of proper transport initialization combined with the premature dereference leads to a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a system crash due to the NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker can trigger this crash by sending a message using an improperly bound RDS socket.  Some sources suggest it might also be possible to cause a host OS panic or hang under KVM.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Some sources mention the possibility of privilege escalation, which would indicate that the race could be used in a more sophisticated exploit, though it is not the primary vector.
*   **Information Exposure:**  Some sources mention that the use-after-free can expose sensitive information from kernel memory when triggered in conjunction with an epoll_ctl call.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local, requiring the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system to create and use the socket.  Some sources indicate that this could be from a guest OS user under KVM.
*   **Crafted keyctl commands:** Some sources mention that crafted keyctl commands can be used to trigger a related vulnerability.
*   **Crafted PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl call:**  Some sources mention that a crafted PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl call could cause a denial of service by using the `slhc_init` function.
*   **Crafted IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) message:** Some sources mention a way to cause a denial of service via crafted RA messages with invalid MTU values, though this is primarily associated with CVE-2015-0272.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the system to create a socket and send a crafted message
*   **KVM Guest Access:** In virtualized environments, a user within a KVM guest can potentially trigger this issue on the host system
*   **Ability to Interact with kernel interfaces:**  The attacker needs to be able to utilize the Linux kernel's socket API or other interfaces (like ioctl calls).

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability lies within `rds_sendmsg` and `__rds_conn_create` functions.
*   The incomplete fix for CVE-2015-6937 left the race condition unresolved.
*   Some sources indicate the fix was backported to stable and openSUSE-42.1 branches.
*   The fix involves acquiring a lock before checking the `rs_bound_addr` field and verifying the underlying transport exists before creating a connection.
*   Various SUSE and openSUSE security advisories address this CVE and list the specific kernel versions and packages that have been patched.
*   Multiple bugzilla entries indicate that the patch has been applied to a wide range of SUSE products and openSUSE Tumbleweed.

**Content Providing More Detail than the CVE Description:**

The analyzed content goes beyond the basic CVE description in several ways:

*   It provides specific code locations (`rds_sendmsg`, `__rds_conn_create`, `security/keys/gc.c`, etc.) and the sequence of events that lead to the vulnerability.
*   It includes explicit details of the race condition and the lack of proper locking.
*   It details the steps an attacker would take to trigger the vulnerability.
*   It provides specific fixes and patch information.
*   It references related vulnerabilities and how they interplay with this one.
*   It explains the context of "incomplete fix" for CVE-2015-6937

In summary, CVE-2015-7990 represents a race condition leading to a DoS vulnerability affecting systems using the RDS implementation in Linux kernels before 4.3.3. The issue is triggered by attempting to send a message on an improperly bound RDS socket. The fix involves using a lock to correctly verify that the socket is bound and the underlying transport is ready.
