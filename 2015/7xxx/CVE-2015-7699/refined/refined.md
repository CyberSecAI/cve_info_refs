Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7699:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3373-1) explicitly lists CVE-2015-7699 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the update for ownCloud. This confirms the relevance of the provided content to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the ability of clients to configure object stores. This should only be done manually within the `mount.json` file, not via client-side configuration.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to set the object store configuration from the client side, which should not be permitted.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** While the provided text doesn't explicitly detail the impact of this specific vulnerability, it's implied that allowing client-side configuration of object stores could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches. The labels "sev2-high" indicates that this vulnerability has a high severity level. The full impact would depend on the nature of the object store being configured and the potential for malicious configuration changes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the client-side configuration settings related to object stores, this could be done by a malicious user.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate the client-side settings within the ownCloud application. This could involve having an account on the system or exploiting a separate vulnerability that grants the ability to modify these settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub pull request #18558 ("Prevent objectstore being set from client side") directly addresses this vulnerability. The fix involves restricting object store configuration to manual configuration in the `mount.json` file, preventing it from being set by clients.
* The fix was backported to stable versions 8.1, 8 and 7.
*   The labels associated with the fix in the pull request include "app:files\_external", "settings:personal", "settings:admin," and "sev2-high" ,  indicating that it impacts the external file storage functionality as well as settings for both personal and admin users.
*   The pull request discussion confirms that the fix was tested and works as expected.

In summary, CVE-2015-7699 in ownCloud arises from the ability to configure object stores from the client-side. This vulnerability is addressed by preventing client-side configuration and restricting it to manual configuration in the `mount.json` file. This would prevent malicious users from being able to modify the configuration of the object store.
