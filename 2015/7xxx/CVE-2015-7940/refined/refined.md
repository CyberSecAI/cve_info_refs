  "CVE-2015-7940": {
    "Metadata": {
      "description": "The Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.51 does not validate a point is within the elliptic curve, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private keys via a series of crafted elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, aka an \"invalid curve attack.\"",

        "Improper validation of elliptic curve points",
        "Lack of validation of input"

         "Network attacks targeting systems using vulnerable bouncycastle libraries for ECDH key exchanges."

      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Ability to send crafted elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges to a system using a vulnerable Bouncy Castle library"
      ],
       "Affected Versions Detail": "bouncycastle versions older than 1.51 are vulnerable"
