{
  "Root cause": "The `config` command in `ntpd` could be used to set the `pidfile` and `driftfile` paths without restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Unrestricted configuration command",
    "Ability to overwrite system files"
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the file system with content representing the pid of the `ntpd` process or the current estimated drift of the system clock.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker with knowledge of the remote configuration password could send a crafted command using the `ntpq` or `ntpdc` utilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the remote configuration password and have network access to the target system."
