**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of faults during the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) process in RSA implementations. Specifically, when ephemeral key exchange is allowed without low memory optimizations on a server, an attacker can exploit these faults.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      - **Missing Fault Verification:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper verification against faults associated with the CRT process during RSA key generation/signing.
      - **Ephemeral Key Exchange:** The issue arises when ephemeral key exchange is enabled on the server side, which forces the use of RSA signatures.
      - **RSA-CRT optimization without hardening:** The use of the RSA-CRT optimization to speed up RSA operations without adequate counter-measures makes exploitation possible.
     - **Deterministic Signature Scheme:** The use of deterministic padding schemes like PKCS#1 v1.5 also allows the attack to be possible, as they expose the value being signed.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
        - **Private Key Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially obtain the server's private RSA key.
        - **Impersonation:** With the private key, an attacker can impersonate the server.
        - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** The attacker can perform man-in-the-middle attacks by redirecting network traffic and impersonating the server.
        - **Decryption of Non-Forward Secrecy Connections:** The leaked key can be used to decrypt past connections that did not use forward secrecy.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
      - **Network Traffic Capture:** The attacker captures TLS handshakes.
      - **TLS Handshake Manipulation:** The attacker might need to initiate many handshakes or modify the handshake process to trigger a fault.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable server over the network.
      - **Passive Observation or Active Interception:** The attacker can be a passive observer or an active interceptor of network traffic to gather the necessary handshake data.
     - **Mathematical Analysis:** The attacker performs offline mathematical computations to recover the private key from the captured handshake data.

**3. Additional Technical Details (from securityblog.redhat.com and people.redhat.com):**

   - **Lenstra's Attack:** The vulnerability is related to an attack described by Arjen Lenstra, which exploits faults during the CRT optimization.
   - **Side-Channel Attack:** This is a side-channel attack that exploits implementation behavior rather than attacking RSA directly.
   - **Fault Conditions:** The fault could arise due to:
       - Integer library defects
       - Race conditions
       - CPU faults
       - Memory corruption
   - **Countermeasures:** The correct countermeasure is to verify the signature after performing the CRT operation.
   - **RSA Blinding:**  RSA blinding does not provide defense against CRT related key leaks.
   - **OpenSSL:** The report notes that OpenSSL has a built-in mitigation, but faulty or modified builds might be vulnerable.
   - **Browser Behavior:** Browsers often perform silent retries, hiding errors to users and making exploitation more difficult to detect. This was shown in table 3 of the Red Hat analysis.
  - **Other protocols affected:** In addition to TLS, IPsec and SSH are also identified as potentially affected by the lack of RSA-CRT hardening.

**4. wolfSSL Information (from wolfssl.com_54125086_20250125_231815.html):**

   - **Affected Components:** The attack only affects wolfSSL TLS servers with private RSA keys, when ephemeral key exchange is enabled, and low memory settings are not used.
   - **Mitigation:** The issue was mitigated with the function `wc_RsaSSL_VerifyInline` which verifies that no fault has happened and is automatically enabled.
   - **Recommended Actions:** Update to wolfSSL 3.6.8 and renew RSA keys if affected. Client-side use of wolfSSL is not impacted.
   - **CVE:** The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2015-7744.

**5. SUSE Information (from www.suse.com_793852d8_20250126_124218.html and lists.opensuse.org):**

  -  The CVE is rated as having "moderate" severity.
