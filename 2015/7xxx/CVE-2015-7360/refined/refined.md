Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the FortiSandbox Web User Interface. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or validate user-controlled parameters before including them in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist within the FortiSandbox WebUI.
- The identified vulnerable parameters are: `serial`, `urlForCreatingReport`, and `id`.
- These parameters are used in different parts of the application, including FortiView search filters, report exports, and file downloads related to VM scans.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code within the security context of an authenticated user's browser session. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to visit a malicious URL. This could be through phishing, social engineering, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the FortiSandbox.
- The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious URL to the victim user.
- The victim user must be logged into the FortiSandbox web interface to be vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory identifies 5 potential XSS vectors, although only three are explicitly demonstrated.
- The advisory also mentions that FortiSandbox 2.0.4 and lower are vulnerable and provides a fix version: Upgrade to FortiSandbox 2.1 or above.
- The vulnerability has a "Medium" severity level.
- The advisory also notes the vendor notification date, vendor disclosure date, and public disclosure date.
