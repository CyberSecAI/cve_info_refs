Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-7450:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of Java objects by the Apache Commons Collections library. Specifically, the use of the `InvokerTransformer` class during deserialization allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of Java objects.
- Use of vulnerable `InvokerTransformer` class from Apache Commons Collections.
- Lack of proper input validation/sanitization before deserialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
- Complete compromise of the target machine, including the ability to install malware, steal sensitive data, and disrupt services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted data (serialized Java objects) to the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerability is often triggered through network-exposed interfaces that deserialize data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to craft or modify serialized Java objects.
- No authentication is required for exploitation in some cases (e.g., IBM WebSphere).

**Affected Products:**
The following products and versions are listed as being affected by CVE-2015-7450:
- IBM Cognos Controller (versions 10.2.1, 10.2, 10.1.1, 10.1, 8.5.1, 8.5)
- IBM Tivoli Common Reporting (versions 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.1.2, 3.1, 3.1.0.1, 3.1.0.2, 3.1.2, 3.1.2.1)
- IBM Watson Explorer Annotation Administration Console (versions 11.0, 10.0 through 10.0.0.2)
- IBM Watson Explorer Analytical Components (versions 11.0, 10.0 through 10.0.0.2)
- IBM Watson Content Analytics (versions 3.5 through 3.5.0.3, 3.0 through 3.0.0.6)
- IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (versions 5.2, 5.1)
- IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere Application Server Hypervisor Edition (versions 8.5, 8.5.5, 8.0, 7.0)
- WebSphere Application Server Liberty (versions 8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.7, 8.5.5.0 through 8.5.5.9, 16.0.0.2 through 17.0.0.3).

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB Content:**

- The exploit-db entry provides a Metasploit module that targets IBM WebSphere.
- It confirms that the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
- The module leverages the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library for the deserialization attack.
- The module constructs a SOAP request to trigger the vulnerability.
- It also confirms that it can achieve Remote Code Execution via Powershell on Windows.

**Mitigations:**

- Applying the provided patches/fixes for each affected product is the recommended remediation.
- IBM also suggests reviewing the environment for other vulnerable installations of Apache Commons Collections.
- There were no listed workarounds.
