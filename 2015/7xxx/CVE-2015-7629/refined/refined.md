  "CVE-2015-7629": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2015-7629",
      "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.252 and 19.x before 19.0.0.207 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.535 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.213, Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.213, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 19.0.0.213 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TextFormat object with a crafted tabStops property, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-7631, CVE-2015-7643, and CVE-2015-7644."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error related to TextFormat objects and their tabStops property within Adobe Flash Player. A crafted tabStops property can cause a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process. A remote attacker could potentially take control of the vulnerable system.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious SWF file. User interaction is required.",
        "By manipulating the `tabStops` property of a `TextFormat` object, an attacker can trigger the use-after-free condition."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SWF file or webpage that can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to be able to lure the victim to open/visit the malicious file or page.",
      "Affected Products": [
        "Adobe Flash Player versions before 18.0.0.252 and 19.x before 19.0.0.207 on Windows and OS X",
        "Adobe Flash Player versions before 11.2.202.535 on Linux",
         "Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.213",
         "Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.213",
         "Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 19.0.0.213"
        ]
