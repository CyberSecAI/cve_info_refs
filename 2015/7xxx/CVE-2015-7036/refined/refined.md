Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-7036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in an API issue within SQLite's functionality, specifically related to how it handles certain SQL commands or inputs. The content suggests a weakness in the `fts3_tokenizer` function and how it handles an optional second argument (pointer to a structure).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **API Issue:** The core weakness is in the API design of SQLite, where a specific function or input processing mechanism doesn't properly validate or handle data, leading to exploitable conditions.
- **Untrusted Pointer:** The `fts3_tokenizer` vulnerability specifically involves an optional second argument that is expected to be a pointer into a structure. This means a malicious actor can provide a crafted pointer, leading to out-of-bounds access when the pointer is used, likely through a crafted SQL command.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The description mentions "improved restrictions", implying that the original code lacked sufficient input validation, allowing for the malicious crafted input to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the ability for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This means the attacker can potentially gain complete control of the system running SQLite.
- **Unexpected application termination:**  A maliciously crafted SQL command could lead to the termination of an application using SQLite, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, likely through a network connection.
- **SQL Command Injection:** The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a maliciously crafted SQL command to the SQLite engine.
- **Malicious File/Page:** User interaction is required as the user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that would contain the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted SQL commands or inputs to the vulnerable SQLite instance over a network or though a malicious file or page.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable API:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific API vulnerability in SQLite, especially regarding the `fts3_tokenizer` function, and how to exploit it through crafted SQL inputs/commands and the second argument.
- **Limited Privilege:** The attacker could be unprivileged.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `fts3_tokenizer` function.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of SQLite prior to the fix.
- The vulnerability is addressed through improved input validation and restrictions.
- This vulnerability is also mentioned in the context of the "WebKit" component of Apple products suggesting that the WebKit rendering engine could be an attack vector.
