Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-7365:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin upgrade form in Revive Adserver was not properly sanitizing filenames before displaying them when an error occurred during the file upload process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin upgrade form that would be executed in the context of the user's browser when the error message is displayed. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement of the affected page, or redirection to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
A specially crafted multipart POST message containing a malicious filename in the upload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to upload a file to the plugin upgrade form with errors and craft a specific multipart POST message to inject malicious code within the filename. No authentication is explicitly mentioned to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
The fix for this vulnerability involved escaping the filenames before displaying them, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code. The vulnerable code was located in the plugin-related template files.
