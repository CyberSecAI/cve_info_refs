Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the WebExtension APIs of Mozilla Firefox before version 43.0. Specifically, the browser does not properly check if a document belongs to an extension before injecting APIs into it, which allows for the potential of privilege escalation. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper API Injection:**  WebExtension APIs are being injected into documents (like background pages and popup windows) without verifying the document's association with a valid WebExtension. This allows untrusted web content to gain access to privileged APIs.
*   **Lack of Principle Checks:** The code fails to enforce the necessary checks to ensure that the document loading a given resource has the right privileges to receive WebExtension APIs.
*   **Inadequate Security Checks:** The vulnerability highlights a gap in security checks which results in a security breach that leads to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute code within a webpage with the same elevated privileges as the vulnerable WebExtension.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive user information such as browser cookies.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can potentially allow arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, given that some of the injected WebExtension APIs may have that capability, or by crafting a more advanced exploit using the APIs.
*   **Denial of Service:** While the main impact is privilege escalation, certain vulnerabilities can cause denial of service through crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can create a specially crafted web page that exploits the lack of checks and uses the injected APIs to perform malicious actions.
*   **Compromised WebExtension:**  A malicious or vulnerable web extension installed by the victim that loads remote web content either in background scripts or popups, which would allow the attack to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page to the victim or have a compromised extension.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must be enticed to visit the malicious webpage in browser context or the malicious extension has to be installed.
*   **Vulnerable WebExtension:** A vulnerable extension must be installed or the victim.
*   **Understanding of WebExtension APIs**: Knowledge of WebExtension APIs is required to craft a working exploit.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability affects Firefox, Thunderbird, and other Mozilla-based products.
* The vulnerability is rated as "critical" or "moderate" in different sources.
* The provided content includes patches and fixes that are applied to remediate the vulnerability on various platforms.
