{
  "CVE-2015-7513": {
    "Description": "The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in the host (system crash).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel does not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT) counters. Specifically, if userspace restores PIT counters with a count of 0 on channels 1 or 2, and a guest attempts to read the count, KVM will perform a modulo operation with 0, leading to a divide-by-zero error.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of PIT counter restoration in KVM leading to a divide-by-zero error."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (system crash) on the host machine.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest can trigger the vulnerability by setting specific PIT counter values to zero and then attempting to read those values."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a user account within a KVM guest with access to PIT I/O ports. Additionally, the host user needs to set the PIT channel counters to zero."
