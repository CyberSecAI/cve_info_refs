```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks CSRF protection, specifically missing tokens, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of a user to perform actions such as updating the password.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to perform actions with the permissions of a valid user, such as changing a user's password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through a web request. An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a user into executing it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted web request, and needs a valid user to unknowingly trigger the request. No prior authentication or privileges are required for a basic exploit."
