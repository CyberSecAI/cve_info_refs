The provided content contains information about CVE-2015-7366. Specifically, it details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Revive Adserver.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some plugin actions (e.g., enabling, disabling) could be performed via GET requests without CSRF protection. Additionally, the `account-user-*.php` scripts weren't validating the CSRF token sent via POST.
- **Weakness/vulnerability**: CSRF vulnerability due to missing or improperly implemented CSRF protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful CSRF attacks could lead to service disruptions (e.g., disabling core plugins) or minor account modifications (e.g., changing contact name and language).
- **Attack vector**: An attacker could trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that performs plugin actions via GET or modifies account details via POST without a valid CSRF token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into performing an action (clicking a link, visiting a page) that triggers the malicious request.
