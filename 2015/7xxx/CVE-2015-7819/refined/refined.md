Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the IBM System Networking Switch Center (SNSC) DB Service, which listens on port 40999 by default.
*   This service improperly handles account details, specifically the administrator's password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The service allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information.
*   **Cleartext Storage:** The SNSC administrator's password is not stored securely, using reversible encryption with a static key and salt. This enables easy decryption if the encrypted password and the static key/salt are obtained.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The service discloses the encrypted password along with other account details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can obtain the administrator's password, granting them full administrative access to the system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With administrative access, the attacker can take control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely by an unauthenticated user on the same network as the vulnerable system.
*   **Direct Port Access:** The attack occurs by interacting with the vulnerable service on port 40999.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the system running the vulnerable SNSC DB Service.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes a critical vulnerability in IBM System Networking Switch Center where an unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain the administrator's password due to the use of reversible encryption with a static key and salt. This allows for a complete compromise of the system.
