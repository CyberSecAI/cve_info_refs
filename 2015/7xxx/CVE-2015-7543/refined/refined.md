The content relates to CVE-2015-7543.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `mktemp(3)` in `arts` and `kdelibs3` to create a user-specific socket directory for Inter-Process Communication (IPC). When the usual well-known location is unavailable, a random directory name is created using `mktemp(3)`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The use of `mktemp(3)` introduces a race condition. A malicious process can create the well-known location, forcing the vulnerable code to use `mktemp(3)` and then potentially beat the race to hijack the IPC.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a malicious process to hijack the IPC of `arts` and/or KDE, potentially gaining unauthorized control or access to user data.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious process can create the well-known IPC socket directory with restricted permissions forcing the vulnerable code to generate a temporary directory with `mktemp(3)`. The attacker then wins the race and hijacks the IPC.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create directories and touch files in the user's home directory (or globally) and execute a process before the vulnerable application.
