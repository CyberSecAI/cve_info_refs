Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7622

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A memory corruption vulnerability exists due to an error in the PDF parser when processing a crafted PDF file with an invalid image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Memory corruption. This is a general term that could indicate a variety of issues such as heap or stack overflows. The document suggests the vulnerability is related to a parsing issue rather than a specific memory corruption like heap or buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, giving an attacker control of the affected system. However, this requires the user to open or preview the malicious PDF file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening or previewing the malicious PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a malicious PDF file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit was reported to Adobe by Francis Provencher of COSIG.
* A proof of concept (POC) is available.

This vulnerability is classified as a memory corruption issue in the PDF parsing process that could allow arbitrary code execution when a user opens a malicious document.
