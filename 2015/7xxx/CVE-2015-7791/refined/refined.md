**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability (according to CVSS v3).
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `search[column]` and `switch` parameters when sending requests to the `admin.php` file.
