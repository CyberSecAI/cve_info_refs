  "CVE-2015-7205": {
    "description": "Integer underflow in the RTPReceiverVideo::ParseRtpPacket function in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.5 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a crafted WebRTC RTP packet.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `RTPReceiverVideo::ParseRtpPacket` function does not properly check for an underflow condition when calculating the payload length of an RTP packet. Specifically, the padding length of the packet is subtracted from the payload length, which could cause an underflow if the padding length is greater than the payload length.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer underflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to memory corruption, a denial-of-service via application crash, sensitive information disclosure and possibly arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted WebRTC RTP packet to a vulnerable client.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a victim running vulnerable versions of Firefox. The attacker must craft malicious WebRTC RTP packets, specifically manipulate the padding length and payload length fields of the RTP packet to trigger the integer underflow. "
