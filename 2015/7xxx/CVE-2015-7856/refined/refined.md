Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7856

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw present in the Real-Time Console interface of OpenNMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The application processes XML input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This code can reference external entities, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.
*   Since OpenNMS runs with root privileges, this vulnerability can lead to significant data exposure, and potentially full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is carried out by sending a crafted XML request to the Real-Time Console interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the OpenNMS application as the "rtc" user.
*   **Default Credentials:** The "rtc" user has a default password of "rtc" which is not mentioned to be changed in the installation guide.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Rapid7 content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifying that the vulnerability exists in the Real-Time Console interface, and the user authentication needed with the default credentials
*   Metasploit module is available to exploit this vulnerability.
