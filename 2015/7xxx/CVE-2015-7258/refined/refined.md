Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of sensitive information (user credentials) in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Passwords:** The device stores user passwords in plain text, allowing them to be viewed by an attacker.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The device exposes user information, including usernames and passwords, through a Telnet connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Access:** An attacker can gain complete access to the device by obtaining the administrator's password, allowing them to modify settings, inject malicious code, and potentially gain access to the network the device is connected to.
- **Data Breaches:** If the device is used to manage sensitive data, an attacker could access and compromise that data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Telnet Protocol:** Attackers use Telnet to connect to the device.
- **Command Execution:** Attackers execute the `login show` command within the Telnet interface to view the clear text passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable ZTE modem or have network access to it.
- **Telnet Client:** The attacker needs a Telnet client to connect to the device.
- **Basic command line knowledge:** Attackers need basic understanding of Telnet and router commands to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in ZTE ADSL ZXV10 W300 modems on software versions W300V2.1.0f_ER7_PE_O57 and W300V2.1.0h_ER7_PE_O57
- The vulnerability is described alongside other vulnerabilities in the same devices, specifically CVE-2015-7257 and CVE-2015-7259.
