  "CVE-2015-7554": {
    "description": "The _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dir.c in libtiff 4.0.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory write and crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted field data in an extension tag in a TIFF image.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how `_TIFFVGetField()` processes extension tags, specifically when the `field_passcount` member of the TIFFField struct is true. This happens when a tag is processed by `_TIFFCreateAnonField()` when `TIFFReadDirectoryFindFieldInfo()` fails, which results in overwriting the expected behaviour of `field_passcount`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized memory: The `field_passcount` is always assigned TRUE if the tag is processed by `_TIFFCreateAnonField()`.",
         "Incorrect handling of extension tags leading to arbitrary memory writes",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking when handling custom fields"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash, memory corruption, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition or other unspecified impacts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious TIFF image with specifically designed extension tags.",
          "Exploiting the vulnerability via applications using the libtiff library"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed TIFF file, no special access or privileges are required.",
       "affected_components": [
        "`_TIFFVGetField()` function in `tif_dir.c`",
        "thumbnail tool",
         "tiffcmp tool",
         "bmp2tiff tool"
      ],
      "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered when the count for a tag is read using `_TIFFVGetField()`, where a value is written to invalid/arbitrary memory",
        "The issue is due to an incorrect override of `field_passcount` and an out-of-bounds write.",
        "The `_TIFFCreateAnonField()` function always sets `field_passcount` to TRUE, even if the tag's definition specifies otherwise, leading to an invalid write when the field is later accessed by `_TIFFVGetField()`.",
          "The vulnerability can be triggered using `tiffsplit` or other libtiff tools such as `bmp2tiff`, `thumbnail`"
      ]
