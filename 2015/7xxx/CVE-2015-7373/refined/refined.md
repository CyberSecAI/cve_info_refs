```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'magic-macros' feature in Revive Adserver allows dynamic data to be displayed in banner output, including arbitrary GET parameters. These parameters were not properly escaped before being displayed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Input values from GET parameters used in 'magic-macros' are not sanitized, leading to reflected XSS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into banner output, which could lead to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that includes a payload within a GET parameter, an attacker could cause the injected script to execute when a victim views a banner that uses that parameter via 'magic-macros'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with GET parameters that will be used in a banner with 'magic-macros'. No specific authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attack requires the victim to view a banner with the injected malicious code. An attacker would need some level of knowledge about how the ad server functions in order to craft a successful exploit."
