The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in 4images version 1.7.11 and earlier.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization/validation of the `cat_description` parameter in the `categories.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability exists due to lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or script code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to stealing sensitive user information, including credentials and personal data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `cat_description` parameter in the `categories.php` page of the 4images administration interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to access the 4images admin interface and modify category descriptions. This would typically require admin or privileged access.
