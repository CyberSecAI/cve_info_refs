    "Root cause": "Improper input validation in the password reset functionality.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection"
    ],

    "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to `/yeager/?action=passwordreset&token=<SQL Injection>`",
        "HTTP POST request to `/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword` with a manipulated userToken parameter"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
