      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Content Analysis": {
      "Relevant Content": true,
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Search feature in Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 on Android through 4.4 supports search-engine URL registration through an intent and can access this URL in a privileged context in conjunction with the crash reporter.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of intent URLs in the Firefox for Android search feature and the crash reporter",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can read log files and visit file: URLs of HTML documents, possibly leaking private information and gaining unauthorized access to local files.",
      "Attack vectors": "A crafted application that registers a malicious search engine URL through an intent can leverage the vulnerable Firefox search feature and crash reporter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious application or website, register it as a search engine on the user's Firefox for Android, and trigger the vulnerability through a search action that results in an intent URI. The attack is network-based and does not require authentication."

      "Relevant Content": true,
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "Race condition in the JPEGEncoder function in Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A race condition in the JPEGEncoder that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash).",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered using a CANVAS element and crafted JavaScript code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a remote position, a user needs to access their crafted Javascript code with a vulnerable browser version. No authentication is required."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 on Android improperly restricts URL strings in intents.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper URL string handling in intent, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can conduct XSS attacks, possibly leading to unauthorized actions within the user's session.",
      "Attack vectors": "An intent: URL and fallback navigation is used to trigger the XSS through crafted URL strings.",

       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A misinterpretation of a security setting in the Add-on SDK that allows execution of inline JavaScript code even when scripts should be disabled.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can conduct XSS attacks via inline JavaScript code within a third-party extension.",
       "Attack vectors": "Attackers exploit this by crafting inline JavaScript code that gets executed within a third-party extension's panel by manipulating the `script: false` parameter.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker has to compromise or create a malicious third-party extension that the user has to install in Firefox. No other user interaction is necessary"

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4 improperly follow the CORS cross-origin request algorithm.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The browser fails to enforce CORS policies correctly for the POST method when certain Content-Type headers are manipulated. Specifically, the lack of a preflight-request step for specific cases.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can bypass the Same Origin Policy.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attack is triggered by manipulating the Content-Type header when making POST requests and exploiting the browsers incorrect handling of CORS. An attacker needs to craft a malicious website to perform the action.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a website with crafted javascript to exploit the CORS implementation flaw in a vulnerable browser version."

       "Root cause of vulnerability": "Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4 allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy for an IP address origin by appending whitespace.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Firefox improperly handles IP address origins, allowing a bypass of the Same Origin Policy when whitespace characters are appended to an IP address string.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially compromising user sessions and performing unauthorized actions.",
