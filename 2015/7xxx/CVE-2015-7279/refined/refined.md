Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-7279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Amped Wireless R10000 router uses static source ports and predictable TXIDs for DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). Specifically, TXIDs increment from 0x0002.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values:** The vulnerability stems from the predictable nature of the source ports and TXIDs used in DNS queries, making them susceptible to spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can spoof DNS responses can redirect LAN clients of the vulnerable router to attacker-controlled hosts. This could lead to various malicious activities like phishing, malware distribution, or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker with the ability to intercept and spoof DNS responses on the network. This could potentially be done by an attacker positioned on the same network segment as the router or potentially from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept DNS queries and spoof DNS responses directed to the local network. This means the attacker needs to be able to intercept traffic on the network path between the router and the DNS server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability note specifies that the Amped Wireless R10000 router, firmware version 2.5.2.11, is affected.
- There are no practical workarounds for general users since they are unlikely to be able to monitor the traffic entering the router's WAN port.
