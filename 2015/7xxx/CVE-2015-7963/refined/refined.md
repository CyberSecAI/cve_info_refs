Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-7963 (along with CVE-2015-7596, CVE-2015-7597, CVE-2015-7598, CVE-2015-7961, CVE-2015-7962, CVE-2015-7964, CVE-2015-7965, CVE-2015-7966, and CVE-2015-7967)

**Root Cause:** Weak Access Control Lists (ACLs) assigned to subdirectories and executable modules of SafeNet Authentication Service Agents during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Permissions:** The installation process grants excessive permissions (full control/modify/write) to authenticated users over the agent's file structure. This allows low-privileged users to modify or replace executable files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges by substituting legitimate executable modules with malicious ones. When a high-privileged user (e.g., an administrator) executes the modified module, the malicious code runs with the administrator's rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Access:** Successful exploitation leads to an attacker gaining full control over the compromised host.
*   **Compromised System:** An attacker can install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions on the affected system.
*   **Impersonation:** An attacker can impersonate a user with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the target machine and must be an authenticated user.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify or substitute executable modules within the affected installation directory.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to wait for a high-privileged user to execute the modified executable to complete the privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Local User:** The attacker must have an account on the targeted machine, including guest accounts.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to the vulnerable file system locations to replace the executable.

**Affected Products:**
The following SafeNet Authentication Service Agents are affected:
*   SafeNet Authentication Service Windows Logon Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service IIS Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service TokenValidator Proxy Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for Outlook Web App Agent
*  **SafeNet Authentication Service for AD FS Agent** (Specifically mentions CVE-2015-7963)
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for NPS Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service Remote Web Workplace Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service for Citrix Web Interface Agent
*   SafeNet Authentication Service End User Software Tools for Windows

**Mitigation:**
*   **Patches:** Most affected agents have maintenance releases available to address this issue, which are available via the SafeNet Authentication Service Downloads or the Service Portal.
*   **Manual Mitigation:** For agents without available patches, administrators can manually adjust the permissions of the installation folder, removing full control/modify/write permissions for Authenticated Users and granting full control to the Administrators group, ensuring child objects inherit the new permissions.
