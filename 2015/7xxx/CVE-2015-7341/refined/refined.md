Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-7341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the JNews Joomla component. This is due to insufficient filtering and validation of file uploads in multiple areas of the component. It also uses a blacklist approach to filter file extensions, which is not secure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload (Subscribers):** The import function within the Subscribers section allows users to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files, without proper validation. The uploaded file name is also prepended with "upload" instead of being stored in the upload folder.
*  **Unrestricted File Upload (Templates):** The template upload functionality allows uploading a zip file containing a malicious PHP file. The component does not validate the contents of the zip archive allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files via a ZIP archive.
*  **Bypass File Extension Filter:** The component uses a blacklist to filter file extensions, and this filter can be bypassed using extensions not included in the list, such as `.htaccess` with PHP code, or the `.php5` extension, allowing for the upload of malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This grants the attacker the ability to take control of the web server, leading to potential data breaches, defacement, and other malicious activities.
*   The attacker can execute system commands on the server, demonstrating a complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are the file upload forms within the JNews component, specifically within:
    *   The Subscribers import form
    *   The Templates upload form
    *  Other file upload functions which utilize the vulnerable `lib.upload.php` component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Joomla administrator panel (at least with low privileged user).
*   The attacker needs the ability to navigate to the vulnerable components, which are located at:
    *   `Administration > Components > Jnews > Subscribers > Import`
    *   Templates upload location as shown in the article.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided article includes screenshots of the vulnerable forms, HTTP requests, and output of executed commands which gives additional information that is not found in the CVE description.
*   The article also provides the vulnerable versions and solution by updating to a patched version.
*   The `lib.upload.php` blacklist filter approach is highlighted in the article, and explains the bypass using `.htaccess` or `.php5` files.
