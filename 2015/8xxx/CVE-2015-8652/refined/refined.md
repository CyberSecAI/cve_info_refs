Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8652:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the MPEG-4 parsing functionality of Adobe Flash. Specifically, a specially crafted MP4 file can trigger the software to read memory beyond the bounds of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The primary weakness is the ability to read memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure or program crashes.
- Improper input validation: The parsing of the MP4 file does not adequately validate the data, allowing for the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system by exploiting this vulnerability. The code would run within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 File: The primary attack vector is a specially crafted MP4 file.
- User Interaction:  User interaction is required. A user would need to either visit a malicious web page containing the exploit or open the malicious MP4 file directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted MP4 file.
- Ability to deliver the file to a target user, either through a malicious website or by directly sending the file.

**Additional Details:**
- Adobe released an update to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter (ID '21940').
- The vulnerability was reported by AbdulAziz Hariri of the HPE Zero Day Initiative.
