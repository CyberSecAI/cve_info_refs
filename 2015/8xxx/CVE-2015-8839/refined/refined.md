  "CVE-2015-8839": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Race condition in the ext4 filesystem implementation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A race condition occurs when punching holes in a file and page faults in the same area happen concurrently.  This can lead to freed blocks still being referenced by page cache pages, which could result in data corruption if those blocks are written to again.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can cause a denial of service (filesystem corruption).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user performing file operations.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user capable of performing file operations on an ext4 filesystem."
  }
