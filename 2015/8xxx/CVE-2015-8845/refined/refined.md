{
  "CVE-2015-8845": {
    "related_to_this_cve": true,
    "root_cause": "The `tm_reclaim_thread` function in the Linux kernel, specific to powerpc platforms, did not properly verify if the system was in TM (Transactional Memory) suspend mode before attempting to reclaim transactional memory. This lack of checking resulted in a double reclaim attempt and a subsequent TM bad thing exception and system panic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper check of TM suspend mode",
      "Missing synchronization"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users could cause a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and system panic).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted application on powerpc platforms with transactional memory features enabled."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user access.",
    "more_info": "The vulnerability was triggered via crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to recursive pagefault handling."
