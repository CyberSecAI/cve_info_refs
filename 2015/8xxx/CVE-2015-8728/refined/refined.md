Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A static buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `my_dgt_tbcd_unpack` function within the ANSI A & GSM A dissectors of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Static buffer overflow:** The `my_dgt_tbcd_unpack` function improperly handles the unpacking of TBCD (Telephony Binary Coded Decimal) data, potentially writing beyond the bounds of a statically allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted, malformed packet can cause Wireshark to crash due to the buffer overflow, leading to denial of service.
- **Potential for Remote Exploitation:** By injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by convincing a user to open a malicious capture file, an attacker could trigger the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** Attacker injects a malformed packet directly into network traffic being captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** Attacker provides a malicious capture file that, when opened, triggers the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to either inject network traffic or deliver a malicious capture file to a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark. No specific user privileges are required.
- No authentication is required for exploitation, as indicated by the "Remote Exploit without Auth.?" column in the Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin.
- The access complexity is medium as per the CVSS v2 score.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.0.0, 1.12.0 to 1.12.8.
- Fixed versions are 2.0.1 and 1.12.9.
- The issue is tracked as Wireshark issue 11797.
- The Gentoo security advisory also lists this as one of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the 2.0.2 version.

This vulnerability is present in the ANSI A and GSM A dissectors within Wireshark, specifically related to the handling of TBCD data via `my_dgt_tbcd_unpack`. The attack can be triggered by injecting malformed network traffic or by opening a malicious packet capture file. Successful exploitation will result in a crash of the Wireshark application, causing a denial of service.
