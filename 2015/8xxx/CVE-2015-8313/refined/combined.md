# USN-2821-1: GnuTLS vulnerability

30 November 2015

GnuTLS could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [gnutls26](/security/cves?package=gnutls26) - GNU TLS library

## Details

It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly validated the first byte of

padding in CBC modes. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

perform a padding oracle attack.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libgnutls26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26)
  -
  [2.12.23-12ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26/2.12.23-12ubuntu2.3)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libgnutls26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26)
  -
  [2.12.14-5ubuntu3.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26/2.12.14-5ubuntu3.10)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

[Impact]

Gnutls is affected by the Poodle TLS exploit <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2014/12/08/poodle-bites-tls>

[Test Case]

launch a new trusty VM

sudo apt-get install cups

Open /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and change just this one section

...

# Only listen for connections from the local machine.

#Listen localhost:631

Listen /var/run/cups/cups.sock

SSLPort 443

SSLOptions None

ServerAlias 127.35.213.162.lcy-02.canonistack.canonical.com

...

Restart cups and then run the ssllabs test - <https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/>

[Regression Potential]

This is a simple off by one error, that's fixed in all newer versions of gnutls.

Tested both with ssllabs should go from F rating to C rating - POODLE TLS issue should be gone, but SSLv3 will still be enabled. That's a separate [bug - 1505328](/bugs/1505328).

Unlike the other cups patch, this gnutls bug I believe should go to security pocket.

Package        : gnutls26
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8313

It was discovered that GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL
protocols, incorrectly validates the first byte of padding in CBC modes.
A remote attacker can possibly take advantage of this flaw to perform a
padding oracle attack.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.12.20-8+deb7u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.

Lucky Microseconds: A Timing Attack on Amazon’s s2n
Implementation of TLS

Martin R. Albrecht(cid:63) and Kenneth G. Paterson(cid:63)(cid:63)

Abstract. s2n is an implementation of the TLS protocol that was released in late June 2015
by Amazon. It is implemented in around 6,000 lines of C99 code. By comparison, OpenSSL
needs around 70,000 lines of code to implement the protocol. At the time of its release, Amazon
announced that s2n had undergone three external security evaluations and penetration tests.
We show that, despite this, s2n — as initially released — was vulnerable to a timing attack in
the case of CBC-mode ciphersuites, which could be extended to complete plaintext recovery in
some settings. Our attack has two components. The ﬁrst part is a novel variant of the Lucky
13 attack that works even though protections against Lucky 13 were implemented in s2n. The
second part deals with the randomised delays that were put in place in s2n as an additional
countermeasure to Lucky 13. Our work highlights the challenges of protecting implementations
against sophisticated timing attacks. It also illustrates that standard code audits are insuﬃcient
to uncover all cryptographic attack vectors.

Keywords TLS, CBC-mode encryption, timing attack, plaintext recovery, Lucky 13, s2n.

1 Introduction

In late June 2015, Amazon announced a new implementation of TLS (and SSLv3), called
s2n [Lab15,Sch15]. A particular feature of s2n is its small code-base: while s2n relies on
OpenSSL or any of its forks for low-level cryptographic processing the core of the TLS protocol
implementation is written in around 6,000 lines of C99. This is intended to make s2n easier
to audit. Indeed, Amazon also announced that s2n had undergone three external security
evaluations and penetration tests prior to release. No details of these audits appear to be in
the public domain at the time of writing. Given the recent travails of SSL/TLS in general and
the OpenSSL implementation in particular, s2n generated signiﬁcant interest in the security
community and technical press.1

We show that s2n — as initially released — was vulnerable to a timing attack on its
implementation of CBC-mode ciphersuites. Speciﬁcally, we show that the two levels of pro-
tection oﬀered against the Lucky 13 attack [AP13] in s2n at the time of ﬁrst release were
imperfect, and that a novel variant of the Lucky 13 attack could be mounted against s2n.

The attack is particularly powerful in the web setting, where an attack involving malicious
client-side Javascript (as per BEAST, POODLE [MDK14] and Lucky 13) results in the com-
plete recovery of HTTP session cookies, and user credentials such as BasicAuth passwords.

1 See for example http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/01/amazon_s2n_tls_library/, http://www.

securityweek.com/amazon-releases-new-open-source-implementation-tls-protocol.

In this setting, an adversary runs malicious JavaScript in a victim’s browser and addition-
ally performs a Person-in-the-Middle attack. We note, though, that many modern browsers
prefer TLS 1.2 AEAD cipher suites avoiding CBC-mode, making them immune to the attack
described in this work if the sever also supports TLS 1.2 cipher suites as s2n does. The issues
identiﬁed in this work have since been addressed in s2n, partly in response to this work, and
current versions are no longer vulnerable to the attacks described in this work.

We stress that the problem we identify in s2n does not arise from reusing OpenSSL’s crypto
code, but rather from s2n’s own attempt to protect itself against the Lucky 13 attack when
processing incoming TLS records. It does this in two steps: (1) using additional cryptographic
operations, to equalise the running time of the record processing; and (2) introducing random
waiting periods in case of an error such as a MAC failure.

Step (1) involves calls to a function s2n_hmac_update, which in turn makes hash com-
pression function calls to, for example, OpenSSL or LibreSSL. The designers of s2n chose
to draw a line above which to start their implementation, roughly aligned at the boundary
between low-level crypto functions and the protocol itself. The ﬁrst part of our attack is
focused at the lowest level above that line. Speciﬁcally, we show that the desired additional
cryptographic operations may not be carried out as anticipated: while s2n always fed the
same number of bytes to s2n_hmac_update, to defeat timing attacks, this need not result
in the same number of compression function calls of the underlying hash function. Indeed
this latter number may vary depending on the padding length byte which controls after how
many bytes s2n_hmac_digest is called, this call producing a digest over all data submitted
so far. We can also arrange that subsequent calls to s2n_hmac_update do not trigger any
compression function calls at all. This has the eﬀect of removing the timing equalisation and
reopening the window for an attack in the style of Lucky 13.

The second part of our attack is focussed on step (2), the random waiting periods in-
troduced in s2n as an additional protection against timing attacks. The authors of [AP13]
showed that adding random delays as a countermeasure to Lucky 13 would be ineﬀective if
the maximum delay was too small. The s2n code had a maximum waiting period that is enor-
mous relative to the processing time for a TLS record, 10s compared to around 1 µs, putting
the attack techniques of [AP13] well out of contention. However, the initial release of s2n
used timing delays generated by calls to sleep and usleep, giving them a granularity much
greater than the timing diﬀerences arising from the failure to equalise the running time in
step (1). Consequently, at a high level, we were able to bypass step (2) by “mod-ing out” the
timing delays provided by sleep and usleep. However, the reality is slightly more complex
than this simple description would suggest, because those functions do not provide delays that
are exact multiples of 1 µs but instead themselves have distributions that need to be taken
into account in our statistical analysis. Weaknesses in random delays as countermeasures to
timing side-channels have been point out before, cf. [CK10]. In contrast to previous work,
though, here the source of timing diﬀerences was not close enough to uniform, allowing our
analysis of the low-level code to “leak through” the random timing delays, despite them being
very large.

Our attack illustrates that protecting TLS’s CBC construction against attacks in the style
of Lucky 13 is hard (cf. [AIES15]). It also shows that standard code audits may be insuﬃcient
to uncover all cryptographic attack vectors.

Our attack can be prevented by more carefully implementing countermeasures to the
Lucky 13 attack that were presented in [AP13]. A fully constant time/constant memory access
patch can be found in the OpenSSL implementation; its complexity is such that around 500

lines of new code were required to implement it, and it is arguable whether the code would
be understandable by all but a few crypto-expert developers. It is worth noting that the
countermeasure against Lucky 13 in OpenSSL does not respect the separation adopted in
the s2n design, i.e. it avoids higher-level interfaces to HMAC but makes hash compression
function calls directly on manually constructed blocks.2 The s2n code was patched to prevent
our attacks using a diﬀerent strategy, (mostly) maintaining the above-mentioned separation.
At a high-level, the ﬁrst step of our attacks exploits that s2n counted bytes submitted to
HMAC instead of compression function calls. In response, s2n now counts the number of
compression function calls. Furthermore, the second s2n countermeasure was strengthened
by switching from using usleep to using nanosleep.

1.1 Disclosure and Remediation

We notiﬁed Amazon of the issue in step (1) of their countermeasures, in s2n_verify_cbc
in s2n on 5th July 2015. Subsequently and in response, this function was revised to address
the issue reported. This issue in itself does not constitute a successful attack because s2n
also implemented step (2), the randomised waiting period, as was pointed out to us by the
developers of s2n. This countermeasure has since been strengthened by switching to the use
of nanosleep to implement randomised wait periods. This transition was already planned
by the developers of s2n prior to learning about our work, but the change was accelerated
in response to it. Our work shows that the switch to using nanosleep was a good decision
because this step prevents the attacks described in this work.3

1.2 Lucky 13 Remedies in other Libraries

As mentioned above OpenSSL prevents the Lucky 13 attack in 500 lines of code which achieves
fully constant time/memory access [Lan13]. GnuTLS does not completely eliminate all poten-
tial sources of timing diﬀerences, but makes sure the number of compression function calls is
constant and other major sources of timing diﬀerences are eliminated. As reported in [Mav13]
this results in timing diﬀerences in the tens of nanonseconds, likely too small to be exploited
in practice. In contrast, GoTLS as of now does not implement any countermeasure to Lucky
13. However, a patch is currently under review to equalise the number of compression function
calls regardless of padding value [VF15]. This ﬁx does not promise constant time/memory
access. Botan does not implement any countermeasure to Lucky 13.4 WolfSSL implements
the recommended countermeasures to Lucky 13 from [AP13].5

2 The TLS Record Protocol and s2n

The main component of TLS of interest here is the Record Protocol, which uses symmetric
key cryptography (block ciphers, stream ciphers and MAC algorithms) in combination with
sequence numbers to build a secure channel for transporting application-layer data. In SSL and

2 See [Lan13] for a detailed description of the patch.
3 We also note that the ﬁrst ﬁx was still vulnerable to a timing attack in step (1), as reported in [ABBD15].
This further highlights the delicacy of protecting against timing side-channel attacks and that the move
towards using nanosleep was a good decision.

attack.html

versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.2, the only encryption option uses a MAC-Encode-Encrypt
(MEE) construction. Here, the plaintext data to be transported is ﬁrst passed through a
MAC algorithm (along with a group of 13 header bytes) to create a MAC tag. The supported
MAC algorithms are all HMAC-based, with MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 being typical hash
algorithms. Then an encoding step takes place. For the RC4 stream cipher, this just involves
concatenation of the plaintext and the MAC tag, while for CBC-mode encryption (the other
possible option), the plaintext, MAC tag, and some encryption padding of a speciﬁed format
are concatenated. In the encryption step, the encoded plaintext is encrypted with the selected
cipher. In the case where CBC-mode is selected, the block cipher is DES, 3DES or AES
(with DES being deprecated in TLS 1.2). The s2n implementation supports 3DES and AES.
Following [PRS11], we refer to this MEE construction as MEE-TLS-CBC.

The MEE construction used in the TLS has been the source of many security issues and
attacks [Vau02,CHVV03,Moe04,PRS11,AP12,AP13]. These all stem from how the padding
that is required in MEE-TLS-CBC is handled during decryption, speciﬁcally the fact that the
padding is added after the MAC has been computed and so forms unauthenticated data in the
encoded plaintext. This long sequence of attacks shows that handling padding arising during
decryption processing is a delicate and complex issue for MEE-TLS-CBC. It, along with the
attacks on RC4 in TLS [ABP+13], has been an important spur in the TLS community’s
push to using TLS 1.2 and its Authenticated Encryption modes. AES-GCM is now widely
supported in implementations. However, the MEE construction is still in widespread use, as
highlighted by the fact that Amazon chose to support it in its minimal TLS implementation
s2n.

2.1 MEE-TLS-CBC

We now explain the core encryption process for MEE-TLS-CBC in more detail.

Data to be protected by TLS is received from the application and may be fragmented and
compressed before further processing. An individual record R (viewed as a byte sequence of
length at least zero) is then processed as follows. The sender maintains an 8-byte sequence
number SQN which is incremented for each record sent, and forms a 5-byte ﬁeld HDR consisting
of a 2-byte version ﬁeld, a 1-byte type ﬁeld, and a 2-byte length ﬁeld. The sender then
calculates a MAC over the bytes SQN||HDR||R; let T denote the resulting MAC tag. Note that
exactly 13 bytes of data are prepended to the record R here before the MAC is computed.
The size of the MAC tag is 16 bytes (HMAC-MD5), 20 bytes (HMAC-SHA-1), or 32 bytes
(HMAC-SHA-256). We let t denote this size in bytes.

The record is then encoded to create the plaintext P by setting P = R||T ||pad. Here pad
is a sequence of padding bytes chosen such that the length of P in bytes is a multiple of b,
where b is the block-size of the selected block cipher (so b = 8 for 3DES and b = 16 for AES).
In all versions of TLS, the padding must consist of p + 1 copies of some byte value p, where
0 ≤ p ≤ 255. In particular, at least one byte of padding must always be added. The padding
may extend over multiple blocks, and receivers must support the removal of such extended
padding. In SSL the padding format is not so strictly speciﬁed: it is only required that the
last byte of padding must indicate the total number of additional padding bytes. The attack
on s2n that we present works irrespective of whether the padding format follows the SSL or
the TLS speciﬁcation.

In the encryption step, the encoded record P is encrypted using CBC-mode of the selected
block cipher. TLS 1.1 and 1.2 mandate an explicit IV, which should be randomly generated.

TLS 1.0 and SSL use a chained IV; our attack works for either option. Thus, the ciphertext
blocks are computed as:

Cj = EKe(Pj ⊕ Cj−1)

where Pi are the blocks of P , C0 is the IV, and Ke is the key for the block cipher E. For TLS
(and SSL), the ciphertext data transmitted over the wire then has the form:

HDR||C

where C is the concatenation of the blocks Ci (including or excluding the IV depending on
the particular SSL or TLS version). Note that the sequence number is not transmitted as part
of the message.

Simplistically, the decryption process reverses this sequence of steps: ﬁrst the ciphertext

is decrypted block by block to recover the plaintext blocks:

Pj = DKe(Cj) ⊕ Cj−1,

where D denotes the decryption algorithm of the block cipher. Then the padding is removed,
and ﬁnally, the MAC is checked, with the check including the header information and a version
of the sequence number that is maintained at the receiver.

However, in order to avoid a variety of known attacks, these operations must be performed
without leaking any information about what the composition of the plaintext blocks is in
terms of message, MAC ﬁeld and padding, and indeed whether the format is even valid. The
diﬃculties and dangers inherent in this are explained at length in [AP13].

For TLS, any error arising during decryption should be treated as fatal, meaning an
encrypted error message is sent to the sender and the session terminated with all keys and
other cryptographic material being disposed of.

2.2 Details of HMAC

As mentioned above, TLS exclusively uses the HMAC algorithm [KBC97], with HMAC-MD5,
HMAC-SHA-1, and HMAC-SHA-256 being supported in TLS 1.2.6 To compute the MAC tag
T for a message M with key Ka, HMAC applies the speciﬁed hash algorithm H twice, in an
iterated fashion:

T = H((Ka ⊕ opad)||H((Ka ⊕ ipad)||M )).

Here opad and ipad are speciﬁc 64-byte values, and the key Ka is zero-padded to bring it
up to 64 bytes before the XOR operations are performed. All the hash functions H used in
TLS have an iterated structure, processing messages in chunks of 64 bytes (512 bits) using
a compression function, with the output of each compression step being chained into the
next step. Also, for all relevant hash functions used in TLS, an 8-byte length ﬁeld followed
by padding of a speciﬁed byte format are appended to the message M to be hashed. The
padding is at least 1 byte in length and extends the data to a (56 mod 64)-byte boundary.

In combination, these features mean that HMAC implementations for MD5, SHA-1 and
SHA-256 have a distinctive timing proﬁle. Messages M of length up to 55 bytes can be
encoded into a single 64-byte block, meaning that the ﬁrst, inner hash operation in HMAC

6 TLS ciphersuites using HMAC with SHA-384 are speciﬁed in RFC 5289 (ECC cipher suites for
SHA256/SHA384) and RFC 5487 (Pre-Shared Keys SHA384/AES) but we do not consider the SHA-384
algorithm further here.

is done in 2 compression function evaluations, with 2 more being required for the outer hash
operation, for a total of 4 compression function evaluations. Messages M containing from 56
up to 64 + 55 = 119 bytes can be encoded in two 64-byte blocks, meaning that the inner
hash is done in 3 compression function evaluations, with 2 more being required for the outer
operation, for a total of 5. In general, an extra compression function evaluation is needed
for each additional 64 bytes of message data. A single compression function evaluation takes
typically a few hundred clock cycles.7

Implementations typically implement HMAC via an “IUF” interface, meaning that the
computation is ﬁrst initialised (I), then the computation is updated (U) as many times
as are needed with each update involving the buﬀering and/or hashing of further message
bytes. When the complete message has been processed, a ﬁnalisation (F) step is performed.
In s2n, OpenSSL or any of its forks is used to implement HMAC. The initialisation step
s2n_hmac_init carries out a compression function call on the 64-byte string Ka ⊕ ipad. The
update step s2n_hmac_update involves buﬀering of message bytes and calls to the compression
function on buﬀered 64-byte chunks of message. Note that no compression function call will
be made until at least 64 bytes have been buﬀered. The ﬁnalisation step s2n_hmac_digest
consists of adding the length encoding and padding, performing ﬁnal compression function
calls to compute the inner hash and then performing the outer hash operation (itself involving
2 compression function evaluations).

2.3 HMAC Computations after Decryption in s2n

The s2n implementation uses the code in Figure 1 to check the MAC on a record in the
function s2n_verify_cbc. This code is followed by a constant-time padding check that need
not concern us here (except to note that the fact that it is constant time helps our attack, since
it enables us to isolate timing diﬀerences coming from this code fragment). In Figure 1, the
content of buﬀer decrypted->data is the plaintext after CBC-mode decryption. The header
SQN||HDR of 13 bytes is dealt with by the calling function.

Notice how the code ﬁrst computes, using the last byte of the plaintext, a value for
padding_length, the presumed length of padding that should be removed (excluding the pad
length byte). Arithmetic is then performed to ﬁnd payload_length, the presumed length
of the remaining payload over which the HMAC computation is to be done. The actual
HMAC computation is performed via an initialise call (not shown), and then the code in
line 78 (update via the function s2n_hmac_update) and line 84 (ﬁnalise via the function
s2n_hmac_digest). Line 86 compares the computed HMAC value with that contained in the
plaintext, and sets a ﬂag mismatches if they do not match as expected.

Line 79 copies the HMAC state to a dummy state, so that line 89 can perform a dummy
s2n_hmac_update computation on data from the plaintext buﬀer. This attempts to ensure
that the number of hash computations carried out is the same, irrespective of the amount of
padding that should be removed. This is in an eﬀort to remove the timing channel exploited
in the Lucky 13 attack. The number of bytes over which the update is performed is equal
to decrypted->size - payload_length - mac_digest_size - 1, which is one less than the
number of bytes in the plaintext buﬀer excluding the 13 bytes of SQN||HDR, the message, and
the MAC value. Recall, however, that this update operation may not actually result in any
compression function computations being carried out. What happens depends on exactly how

7 For example, SHA-256 takes about 550 cycles per block on one of our test systems, an Intel Core i7–4850HQ

CPU @ 2.30GHz, whereas SHA-1 takes about 300 cycles.

many bytes are already sitting unprocessed in the internal buﬀer and how many are added to
it in the call.

2.4 Randomised Waiting Period

In order to additionally protect against attacks exploiting timing side-channels, s2n imple-
ments the following countermeasure: whenever an error occurs, the implementation waits for
a random period of time before sending an error message. We reproduce the relevant code
excerpts in Figure 2; at a high level, when a MAC failure occurs, the following steps are taken:

– All available data is erased. Depending on the amount of buﬀered data, the time this takes

may vary.

– All connection data is wiped, which may also introduce a timing diﬀerence.
– A random integer x between 1,000 and 10,001,000 is requested. Since rejection sampling

is used to generate x, this might also introduce some timing variation.

– This random integer is then fed to usleep and sleep calls (after the appropriate scaling),

causing a random delay of at least x µs.

We note that this countermeasure, which is activated by default, is designed as an API
mode which can in principle be disabled. This is to support implementations which pro-
vide their own timing channel countermeasures. If the variable blinding is not equal to

S2N_BUILT_IN_BLINDING then none of the countermeasure code is run.8 Since this counter-
measure introduces a delay of up to 10s in case of an error, it might be tempting for some
application developers to disable it. However, note that the s2n documentation strongly ad-
vises against disabling this counter measure without replacing it by an equivalent one on the
application level.

3 The Attack without the Random Waiting Period Countermeasure

We ﬁrst describe our variant of the Lucky 13 attack against s2n assuming the random waiting
period countermeasure is not present. We show how to deal with this additional countermea-
sure in Section 4.

For simplicity of presentation, in what follows, we assume the CBC-mode IVs are explicit
(as in TLS 1.1 and 1.2). We also assume that b = 16 (so our block cipher is AES). It is easy
to construct variants of our attacks for implicit IVs and for b = 8. The MAC algorithm is
HMAC-H where H is either MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-256. We focus at ﬁrst on the case where
the MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA-256, so that t = 32. We explain below how the attack can
be adapted to t = 16 and t = 20 (HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-1, respectively).

Let C∗ be any ciphertext block whose corresponding plaintext P ∗ the attacker wishes to
recover. Let C(cid:48) denote the ciphertext block preceding C∗. Note that C(cid:48) may be the IV or the
last block of the preceding ciphertext if C∗ is the ﬁrst block of a ciphertext. We have:

8 However, we note that a bug in the version of s2n that we studied prevented this from ever happening,

because the call to wipe the connection data erased this conﬁguration ﬂag as well.

P ∗ = DKe(C∗) ⊕ C(cid:48).

Let ∆ be an arbitrary block of 16 bytes and consider the decryption of a ciphertext

Catt(∆) of the form

Catt(∆) = HDR||C0||C1||C2||C3||C(cid:48) ⊕ ∆||C∗
consisting of a header ﬁeld HDR containing an appropriate value in the length ﬁeld, an IV
block, and 5 non-IV blocks. The IV block and the ﬁrst 3 non-IV blocks are arbitrary, the
penultimate block C4 = C(cid:48) ⊕∆ is an XOR-masked version of C(cid:48) and the last block is C5 = C∗.
The corresponding 80-byte plaintext is P = P1||P2||P3||P4||P5 in which

P5 = DKe(C∗) ⊕ (C(cid:48) ⊕ ∆)

= P ∗ ⊕ ∆.

Notice that P5 is closely related to the unknown, target plaintext block P ∗. Notice also
that, via line 67 of the code in Figure 1, the variable payload_and_padding_size is set to
80 − 32 = 48 (recall that the 13-byte string SQN||HDR was fed to HMAC by the calling function
and is buﬀered but otherwise unprocessed at this point). We now consider 2 distinct cases:

1. Suppose P5 ends with a byte value from the set {0x00, . . . , 0x04}. In this case, the code sets
padding_length to be at most 4 and then, at line 72, payload_length is set to a value that
is at least 48−4−1 = 43 (and at most 47). This means that when the HMAC computation
is performed in lines 78 (update) and 84 (ﬁnalise), the internal buﬀer contains at least 56
bytes (because 13 bytes were already buﬀered by the calling function) and exactly 5 calls to
the compression function will be made, including one call that initialises HMAC and 2 that
ﬁnalises it. The time equalising code at line 89 adds between 0 and 4 bytes to the internal
buﬀer, which still holds the previous message bytes. However, because of the short length
of our chosen ciphertext, the buﬀer ends up being exactly 60 bytes in size. This number
is obtained by considering the 13 bytes of SQN||HDR, the payload_length bytes added to
the buﬀer at line 78 and the decrypted->size - payload_length - mac_digest_size -
1 bytes added to the buﬀer at line 89. Combining these, one arrives at there being 12 +
decrypted->size - mac_digest_size bytes in the buﬀer. This evaluates to 60 for the
particular values in the attack. Notably, this number is independent of payload_length
and padding_length. The call at line 89 is to the update function rather than the ﬁnalise
function, so at least 64 bytes would be needed in the buﬀer to cause any compression
function computations to be performed at this point. Thus no compression function call
is made as a consequence of the call to s2n_hmac_update at line 89.

2. Suppose P5 ends with a byte value from the set {0x05, . . . , 0xff}. In this case, the code sets
padding_length to be at least 5 and then, at line 72, payload_length is set to a value that
is at most 48 − 5 − 1 = 42 (and at least 0). This means that when the HMAC computation
is performed in lines 78 (update) and 84 (ﬁnalise), the internal buﬀer contains at most 55
bytes and exactly 4 calls to the compression function will be made (again, including the
initialisation and ﬁnalisation calls). The time equalising code at line 89 will again result
in no additional calls to the compression function being made, as the internal buﬀer is
again too small at exactly 60 bytes in size (recall that the buﬀer size is independent of
payload_length and padding_length).

Based on this case analysis, a timing diﬀerence will arise in HMAC processing of the
attack ciphertext Catt(∆), according to whether the last byte of P5 = P ∗ ⊕ ∆ is from the set
{0x00, . . . , 0x04} or not. The diﬀerence is equal to that taken by one compression function call.
This timing diﬀerence becomes evident on the network in the form of a diﬀerence in the arrival

time of an error message at the man-in-the-middle attacker who injects the attack ciphertext.
The diﬀerence is of the same size as that observed in the plaintext recovery attack presented
in [AP13], a few hundred clock cycles on a modern processor. Of course, as in [AP13], this
time diﬀerence would be aﬀected by noise arising from network jitter, but it is suﬃciently big
to enable it to be detected. Furthermore, if the attacker can arrange to be co-resident with
the victim in a cloud environment, a realistic prospect as shown by a line of work culminating
in [VZRS15], the attacker can perform a Person-in-the-Middle attack and observe the usage
of resources on the server by being co-resident.

As was the case in [AP13], the attack can be iterated as often as is desired and with
diﬀerent values of ∆, provided the same plaintext is repeated at a predictable location across
multiple sessions. The attack as presented already takes care of the complication that each
trial will involve a diﬀerent key in a diﬀerent TLS session; only P ∗ needs to be constant for
it to work.

By carefully exploring the timing behaviour for diﬀerent values in the last byte of ∆ (each
value being tried suﬃciently often so as to minimise the eﬀect of noise), the attacker can
deduce the value of the last byte of P ∗. For example, the attacker can try every value in the
6 most signiﬁcant bits in the last byte of ∆ to identify a value ∆∗ for which the time taken
is relatively high. This indicates that the last byte of P ∗ ⊕ ∆∗ is in the set {0x00, . . . , 0x04};
a more reﬁned analysis can then be carried out on the 3 least signiﬁcant bits of the last byte
of ∆∗ to identify the exact value of the last byte of P ∗. The worst case cost of this version of
the attack is 64 + 8 = 72 trials (multiplied by a factor corresponding to the number of trials
per ∆ needed to remove noise).

The attack cost can be reduced further by using initially longer ciphertexts, because the
peculiar characteristics of the s2n code mean that this choice results in there being a greater
number of values for (the last byte of) ∆ that result in a higher processing time; the precise
value of the last byte of P ∗ can then be pinned down by using progressively shorter ciphertexts.
We omit the details of this enhancement.

3.1 Extending to Full Plaintext Recovery

In the web setting, with HTTP session cookies as the target, the attack extends in a straight-
forward manner to full plaintext recovery using by-now-standard techniques involving mali-
cious client-side Javascript and careful HTTP message padding. A good explanation of how
this is achieved can be found in [MDK14] describing the POODLE attack on TLS. BasicAuth
passwords also form a good target; see [GPdM15] for details.

3.2 Variants for HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-1

Assume b = 16 (as in AES) and consider the case of HMAC-MD5. Then, because t = 16 in
this case, and t is still a multiple of b, the attack described above works perfectly, except that
we need to use a ciphertext having 4 non-IV blocks instead of 5. The attack also works for
b = 8 for both HMAC-MD5 and HMAC-SHA-256 by doubling the number of non-IV blocks
used.

For HMAC-SHA-1, we have t = 20. Assume b = 16 (AES). Then a similar case analysis
as above shows that using a ciphertext with 4 blocks result in a slow execution time if and
only if the last plaintext block P4 ends with 0x00. This leads to a plaintext recovery attack
requiring, in the worst case, 256 trials per byte. The attack adapts to the b = 8 case by again
doubling the number of non-IV blocks used.

4 Defeating the Random Wait Period Countermeasure

As described in Section 2.4, s2n implemented a second countermeasure against attacks ex-
ploiting timing channels. In this section, we show how it could be defeated.

4.1 Characterising the Timing Delays

To start oﬀ, we notice that at the price of increasing the number of samples by a factor of
roughly ten, we can assume that sleep at line 103 in the code in Figure 2 is called with
parameter zero, by rejecting in an attack any sample where the overall time is more than 1s.
This removes one potential source of randomness. As shown in Figure 3, calling sleep(0)
has a rather stable timing proﬁle.

Next, we consider calls to usleep with a random delay as a source of timing randomness.
For this, note that usleep has a granularity of 1µs. On our main test machine, which is
clocked at 3.3Ghz, this translates to 3,300 clock cycles.9 From this, we might expect that
if we take our timings modulo the clock ticks per µs (namely, 3,300 on our test machine),
we could ﬁlter out all the additional noise contributed by the usleep(delay) call. However,
usleep(delay) does not guarantee to return after exactly delay µs, or even to return after
an exact number of µs. Instead, it merely guarantees that it will return after at least delay
µs have elapsed. Indeed, on a typical UNIX system, waking up a process from sleep can take
an unpredictable amount of time depending on global the state of the OS.

However, despite this, usleep does show exploitable non-uniform behaviour on the systems
we tested. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate this behaviour. Figure 4 shows raw timings (in clock
cycles) for usleep(d), normalised to remove the minimum possible delay, namely 3, 300 · d
clock cycles. Figure 5 shows the distribution of timings (in clock cycles) for usleep(delay)
with delay uniformly random in an interval [0, d), but now taken modulo 3,300. Both ﬁgures

frequency and above it (e.g. Intel Turbo Boost). This must be taken into account when measuring time
delays in elapsed clock cycles.

needed to bypass the random waiting period countermeasure in s2n.

Probability on the y axis.

Figures 6 and 7 show that, like the call to usleep, the calls to the functions s2n_stuffer_wipe

and s2n_public_random also do not produce timing proﬁles which are uniform modulo 1µs
(3,300 clock cycles).

However, it is not enough to simply characterise the timing proﬁle of the calls to usleep;
rather it is necessary to study the distribution of the running time of the entire random timing
delay code in Figure 2, in combination with the code for checking the MAC on a TLS record in
Figure 1, for diﬀerent values of the mask ∆ in the attack in Section 3. Figure 8 brings diﬀerent
sources of timing diﬀerence together and shows that the timing distributions (modulo 3,300)
that are obtained for diﬀerent mask values are indeed still rather easily distinguishable. The
ﬁgure is for samples with the maximum delay restricted to 100,000µs instead of 10s. We
stress that this is a synthetic benchmark for studying the behaviour of the various sources
of timing randomness and does not necessarily represent actual behaviour. See Section 5 for
experiments with the actual s2n implementation of these countermeasures.

4.2 Distinguishing Attack

Having characterised the timing behaviour of the s2n code, as exempliﬁed in Figure 8, we
are now in a position to describe a statistical attack recovering plaintext bytes and its perfor-
mance. In fact, the approach is completely standard: given the preceding analysis, we expect
the timing distributions modulo 1µs for ciphertexts in the attack of Section 3 to fall into two

classes depending on the value of the last byte of P ∗ ⊕∆, one class H = {0x00, . . . , 0x04}, the
other class L = {0x05, . . . , 0xff}; if the observed distributions for all values in L (resp. H) are
close to each other but the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between distributions from L
and H is large (and equal to D, say), then, applying standard statistical machinery, we know
that we will require about 1/D samples to distinguish samples from the two distributions. As
Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate, the requirements on KL divergence for values in L and H are
indeed satisﬁed, even for relatively large values for the maximum delay.

For example, assuming for the sake of argument that no additional noise is introduced by
network jitter or other sources, we would be able to distinguish the value 0x00 from 0xc8 in
the last byte of P ∗ ⊕ ∆ with 1/(3.6/1, 000) ≈ 280 TLS sessions if the maximum delay were re-
stricted to 100,000µs. Using rejection sampling, i.e. discarding all samples with a delay greater
than 100,000µs from the actual distribution produced by s2n (where the maximum delay is

actual implementation and because the surrounding code and network jitter will introduce
additional noise.

4.3 Plaintext Recovery Attack

We can extend this distinguishing attack to a plaintext recovery attack in the following
(standard) way. We assume that in a characterisation step, we have obtained, for possible
value x of the last byte in block P5, a histogram of the timing distribution modulo 1µs for
ciphertexts Catt(∆) of the form used in the attack. We assume these timings are distributed
into B equal-sized bins, and so the empirical probability of each bin px,b for 0 ≤ b < B can
be calculated. (In fact, since we expect that timing behaviours for the classes H and L are
similar, it is suﬃcient to sample for two values x, one from each class.)

Now, in the actual attack, for each value δ of the last byte of ∆, we obtain N samples
for ciphertexts Catt(∆) for which the timing delay is at most 100,000µs. This then requires
a total of about 256 · 100 · N TLS sessions. We bin these into B bins as above, letting nδ,b
denote the number of values in bin b for last byte value δ. Now for each candidate value y for
the last byte of P ∗, we compute the log likelihood for the candidate, using the formula:

LL(y) =

(cid:88)

nδ,b · log(pδ⊕y,b) .

δ∈{0x00,...,0xFF}

We then output as the preferred candidate for the last plaintext byte the value y∗ having the
highest value of LL(y) amongst all candidates.

We omit the detailed analysis of the performance of this attack, pausing only to note that
it will require more samples than the distinguishing attack because the underlying statistical
problem is to now separate one correct candidate from 255 wrong candidates, and this is more
demanding than the basic distinguishing problem.

To wrap up, we note that nanosleep, which is now used in s2n to add a random time
delay, has a granularity of nanoseconds, does not show this behaviour, and therefore thwarts
the attacks described in this work.

5 Proof of Concept

We conﬁrmed that s2n does indeed behave as expected using the following two experiments.
For the ﬁrst experiment, we setup a s2n_blob buﬀer of length 93 and ﬁlled it with random
data. Then, we assigned all possible padding length values 0x00 to 0xff by overwriting the
last byte of the buﬀer and timed how long the function s2n_verify_cbc took to return. As
expected, the padding length values between 0x00 and 0x04 resulted in timings about 500–550
cycles longer than all other values. The timing diﬀerence was clear and stable. Some sample
data is shown in Tables 3 and 4. We note that at present we cannot explain the variation
within the second and third columns of those tables.

For the second experiment, we ran the attack against the actual s2n implementation
instead of running a synthetic benchmark. That is, we timed the execution of s2n_recv
under the attack described in Section 3. However, to speed up execution we patched s2n to
only sample random delays up to 10,000µs. As highlighted in Table 5, this, too, shows marked
non-uniform timing behaviour modulo 1µs.

We did not adjust our proof-of-concept code to realise a full plaintext recovery attack,
because (a) s2n has since been patched in response to this work and because (b) the cost
is somewhat dependent on the target machine and operating system. We note, though, that
an attack can establish the characteristics of a target machine by establishing genuine TLS
sessions (where, hence, padding bytes are known) but with some random bits ﬂipped.

The complete source codes for our experiments (which borrow heavily from the s2n test

suite) are available at https://bitbucket.org/malb/research-snippets.

6 Discussion

Our attack successfully overcomes both levels of defence against timing attacks that were
instituted in s2n, the ﬁrst level being the inclusion of extra cryptographic operations in an

attempt to equalise the code’s running time and the second level being the use of a random
wait interval in the event of an error such as a MAC failure.

Fundamentally, the ﬁrst level could be bypassed because s2n counted bytes going into
s2n_hmac_update instead of computing the number of compression function calls that need to
be performed as suggested in [AP13]. A call to s2n_hmac_update in itself will not necessarily
trigger a compression function call if insuﬃcient data for such a call is provided. A call to
s2n_hmac_digest, however, will pad the data and trigger several compression function calls,
the number also depending on the data already submitted at the time of the call. We note
that in OpenSSL this issue is avoided by eﬀectively re-implementing HMAC in the function
ssl3_cbc_digest_record, i.e. by performing lower-level cryptographic operations within the
protocol layer. In contrast, s2n is speciﬁcally aimed at separating those layers. In response
to this work, s2n now sensibly counts the number of compression function calls performed,
somewhat maintaining this separation.

The second level could be bypassed because, while the randomised wait periods were large,
they were not suﬃciently random to completely mask the timing signal remaining from the
ﬁrst step of our attack. Note that the analysis in [AP13] of the eﬀectiveness of random delays
in preventing the Lucky 13 attack assumed the delays were uniformly distributed; under this
assumption, their analysis shows that the count measure is not eﬀective unless the maximum
delay is rather large. What the second step of our attack shows is that, even if the maximum
delay is very large, non-uniformity in the distribution of the delay can be exploited. In short,
it is vital to carefully study any source of timing delay to ensure it is of an appropriate quality
when using it for this kind of protection.

Our experiments indicate that the distribution of nanonsleep as implemented on Linux
is suﬃciently close to uniform to thwart the attack described in this work. We note, however,
that this puts a high security burden on this function which is not designed for this purpose.
In particular, nanosleep(2) states (emphasis added): “nanosleep() suspends the execution of
the calling thread until either at least the time speciﬁed in *req has elapsed, or the delivery
of a signal that triggers the invocation of a handler in the calling thread or that terminates
the process.”

Finally, since randomised waiting can also have a signiﬁcant performance impact, this
work further highlights that MAC-then-Encrypt constructions such as MEE-TLS should be
avoided where possible.

How to run :

$time taskset -c 0 -15 parallel -- gnu -j 500 -- delay 0.1 \

./ s2n - time - random - delay -p 100 -t 17 -d 10000 -n ::: ‘ seq -w 0 2047 ‘

- ‘ time ‘ overall time
- ‘ tastset -c 0 -15 ‘ to restrict to 16 cores
- ‘ parallel -- gnu -j 500 -- delay 0.1 ‘ run 500 experiments in parallel ,

- ‘./ s2n - time - random - delay -p 100 -t 17 -d 10000 -n ‘ run for padding_length 100 ,

start then with a delay of 0.1 seconds
of each other

run 2^17 trials , max delay 10000 ,
with prefix -n

- ‘::: ‘ seq -w 0 2047 ‘ ‘ run 2048 experiments

# A little POODLE left in GnuTLS (old versions)

[Hanno's Blog](https://blog.hboeck.de/)

#### [A little POODLE left in GnuTLS (old versions)](/archives/877-A-little-POODLE-left-in-GnuTLS-old-versions.html)

![Poodle](/uploads/smallpoodle.jpg)***tl;dr** Older GnuTLS versions (2.x) fail to check the first byte of the padding in CBC modes. Various stable Linux distributions, including Ubuntu LTS and Debian wheezy (oldstable) use this version. Current GnuTLS versions are not affected.*

A few days ago an [email on the ssllabs mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/p/ssllabs/mailman/message/34629992/) catched my attention. A Canonical developer had observed that the [SSL Labs test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) would report the GnuTLS version used in Ubuntu 14.04 (the current long time support version) as vulnerable to the POODLE TLS vulnerability, while other tests for the same vulnerability showed no such issue.

A little background: The original POODLE vulnerability is a weakness of the old SSLv3 protocol that's now officially deprecated. POODLE is based on the fact that SSLv3 does not specify the padding of the CBC modes and the padding bytes can contain arbitrary bytes. A while after POODLE Adam Langley reported that there is [a variant of POODLE in TLS](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html), however while the original POODLE is a protocol issue the POODLE TLS vulnerability is an implementation issue. TLS specifies the values of the padding bytes, but some implementations don't check them. Recently Yngve Pettersen reported that there are [different variants of this POODLE TLS vulnerability](https://vivaldi.net/en-US/userblogs/entry/there-are-more-poodles-in-the-forest): Some implementations only check parts of the padding. This is the reason why sometimes different tests lead to different results. A test that only changes one byte of the padding will lead to different results than one that changes all padding bytes. Yngve Pettersen uncovered POODLE variants in devices from Cisco (Cavium chip) and Citrix.

I looked at the Ubuntu issue and found that this was exactly such a case of an incomplete padding check: The first byte wasn't checked. I believe this might explain some of the vulnerable hosts Yngve Pettersen found. This is the code:

`for (i = 2; i <= pad; i++)

{

if (ciphertext.data[ciphertext.size - i] != pad)

pad_failed = GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED;

}`

The padding in TLS is defined that the rightmost byte of the last block contains the length of the padding. This value is also used in all padding bytes. However the length field itself is not part of the padding. Therefore if we have e. g. a padding length of three this would result in four bytes with the value 3. The above code misses one byte. i goes from 2 (setting block length minus 2) to pad (block length minus pad length), which sets pad length minus one bytes. To correct it we need to change the loop to end with pad+1. The code is completely reworked in current GnuTLS versions, therefore they are not affected. Upstream has officially announced the end of life for GnuTLS 2, but some stable Linux distributions still use it.

The story doesn't end here: After I found this bug I talked about it with Juraj Somorovsky. He mentioned that he already read about this before: In the [paper of the Lucky Thirteen attack](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf). That was published in 2013 by Nadhem AlFardan and Kenny Paterson. Here's what the Lucky Thirteen paper has to say about this issue on page 13:

`for (i = 2; i < pad; i++)

{

if (ciphertext->data[ciphertext->size - i] != ciphertext->data[ciphertext->size - 1])

pad_failed = GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED;

}`

*It is not hard to see that this loop should also cover the edge case i=pad in order to carry out a full padding check. This means that one byte of what should be padding actually has a free format.*

If you look closely you will see that this code is actually different from the one I quoted above. The reason is that the GnuTLS version in question already contained [a fix that was applied in response to the Lucky Thirteen paper](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/eb2f4e7ca984c5ef765851388f829ef9e7ec5c9b). However what the Lucky Thirteen paper missed is that the original check was off by two bytes, not just one byte. Therefore it only got an incomplete fix reducing the attack surface from two bytes to one.

In a later commit this whole code [was reworked in response to the Lucky Thirteen attack](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/328ee22c1b3951e060c7124c7cb1cee592c59bc0) and there the problem got fixed for good. However that change never made it into version 2 of GnuTLS. Red Hat / CentOS packages contain a backport patch of those changes, therefore they are not affected.

You might wonder what the impact of this bug is. I'm not totally familiar with the details of all the possible attacks, but the POODLE attack gets increasingly harder if fewer bytes of the padding can be freely set. It most likely is impossible if there is only one byte. The Lucky Thirteen paper says: "This would enable, for example, a variant of the short MAC attack of [[28]](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/mee-comp.pdf) even if variable length padding was not supported.". People that know more about crypto than I do should be left with the judgement whether this might be practically exploitabe.

Fixing this bug is a simple [one-line patch I have attached here](/uploads/gnutls-2-fix-small-poodle.diff "gnutls-2-fix-small-poodle.diff"). This will silence all POODLE checks, however this doesn't apply all the changes that were made in response to the Lucky Thirteen attack. I'm not sure if the code is practically vulnerable, but Lucky Thirteen is a tricky issue, recently a [variant of that attack was shown against Amazon's s2n library](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1129.pdf).

The missing padding check for the first byte got [CVE-2015-8313](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8313) assigned. Currently I'm aware of [Ubuntu LTS](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26/%2Bbug/1510163) (now [fixed](https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2821-1/)) and Debian oldstable (Wheezy) being affected.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-12-02 11:23:09 UTC  ``` It was discovered that gnutls incorrectly validates the first byte of padding in CBC modes. A remote attacker can possibly take advantage of this flaw to perform a padding oracle attack. Affected are older versions of gnutls (2.x).  Public via:  <https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3408> <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Dec/0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c1)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2015-12-02 12:02:27 UTC  ``` This bug does not affect RHEL-6 or RHEL-7. They have been patched with the proper fixes for Lucky13 which included the fix for that issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c2)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2015-12-02 12:04:21 UTC  ``` It doesn't affect RHEL-5 either.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-12-02 12:49:59 UTC  ``` Details of this issue can be found in the Hanno Böck's blog post:  <https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/877-A-little-POODLE-left-in-GnuTLS-old-versions.html>  Here is also the original Ubuntu bug report:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnutls26/+bug/1510163](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnutls26/%2Bbug/1510163)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-12-02 12:53:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1101466](attachment.cgi?id=1101466 "Patch extracted from Debian packages gnutls26-2.12.20-8+deb7u4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1101466&action=edit "Patch extracted from Debian packages gnutls26-2.12.20-8+deb7u4") Patch extracted from Debian packages gnutls26-2.12.20-8+deb7u4   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1287572#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2015-12-02 12:56:26 UTC  ``` The GnuTLS version of Lucky13 got [CVE-2013-1619](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1619) ([bug 908238](show_bug.cgi?id=908238 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-1619 gnutls: TLS CBC padding timing attack (lucky-13)")) and got corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  As noted above, the fix used addressed Lucky13 without leaving this small problem in.   ``` |  |
