Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of CVE-2015-8252 lies in the insecure custom protocol used by RSI Video Technologies' Videofied security system's Frontel software. Specifically, the authentication key is derived entirely from the device's serial number, which is transmitted in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The pre-shared key for AES-128 encryption is not hardcoded, but it is derived deterministically from the device serial number.
*  The serial number is transmitted in clear text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can easily obtain the encryption key by reading the serial number.
*   With the key, the attacker can spoof messages and manipulate the system, including sending false alarms, deactivating alarms, and potentially snooping on data like video feeds.
*   The system lacks integrity protection, making message alteration simple.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack can be carried out remotely over the network, given the system communicates over TCP port 888.
*   An attacker needs to observe or intercept a message containing the device's serial number.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the target system.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept or observe the initial communication where the device's serial number is transmitted.
*   No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The authentication process involves a challenge-response mechanism using AES-128 encryption.
*   The key is derived from the device serial number by a specific transformation.
*   The system lacks encryption of messages and videos, meaning all data is transmitted in plain text after the initial handshake.
*   There are no integrity checks, meaning an attacker can modify messages in transit without detection.
*   The protocol does not have sequence numbers, which would prevent replay attacks.
