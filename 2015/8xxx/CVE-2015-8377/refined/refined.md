Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8377:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `graphs_new.php` script of Cacti. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL command execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application, leading to arbitrary command execution on the database.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution:  Successful exploitation could allow attackers to potentially gain full control over the vulnerable system.
- Data breach: Attackers could read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
- Bypass access restrictions: Authenticated users could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network, which means a malicious actor does not need local system access.
- HTTP requests: The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `graphs_new.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the Cacti server.
- Knowledge of vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters in the `graphs_new.php` script to craft the SQL injection payloads.
- Basic web request knowledge: The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information indicates that Cacti versions prior to 0.8.8h are vulnerable.
- Patches for this vulnerability were released by Debian in versions `0.8.8a+dfsg-5+deb7u8` (wheezy), `0.8.8b+dfsg-8+deb8u4` (jessie), and `0.8.8f+ds1-4` (stretch/sid).
