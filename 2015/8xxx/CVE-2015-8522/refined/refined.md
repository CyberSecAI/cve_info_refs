  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper bounds checking in server command processing.",

  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to the target's TCP port.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server."
