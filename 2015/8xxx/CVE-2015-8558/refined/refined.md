{
  "CVE-2015-8558": {
    "Root cause": "The USB EHCI emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial-of-service (via resource exhaustion) due to excessive CPU cycles consumption on the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "Communication between the host controller interface (EHCI) and a device driver using an isochronous transfer descriptor list (iTD). A closed loop in this list causes the infinite loop.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A privileged user inside the guest virtual machine can trigger this vulnerability."
  }
