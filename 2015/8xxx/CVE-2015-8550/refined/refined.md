CVE-2015-8550:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A double fetch vulnerability in the Xen PV backend drivers due to compiler optimizations, where shared memory between frontend and backend can be fetched multiple times allowing the frontend to alter the content between fetches leading to arbitrary code execution on the backend
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Double fetch vulnerability
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (host OS crash) or privilege escalation.
  - Attack vectors: A malicious guest OS administrator can trigger the vulnerability.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Local guest OS administrator on a system providing PV backends.

CVE-2015-7550:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A race condition in the keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel where `keyctl_revoke` and `keyctl_read` calls are not properly synchronized with a semaphore
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Race condition
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or unspecified other impact.
  - Attack vectors: A local user can trigger the race condition with a crafted application.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user.

CVE-2015-8543:
  - Root cause of vulnerability:  Missing validation of protocol identifiers in the networking implementation for certain protocol families
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insufficient validation of input
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (NULL function pointer dereference and system crash) or privilege escalation.
  - Attack vectors: Local users can trigger a crafted SOCK_RAW application.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability within their own user namespace.

CVE-2015-7566:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: NULL pointer dereference in the clie_5_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (system crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.
  - Attack vectors: By inserting a USB device that lacks a bulk-out endpoint.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Physically proximate attacker.

CVE-2015-8709:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Mishandling of uid and gid mappings in kernel/ptrace.c
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate permission checks, uid/gid mapping issues
  - Impact of exploitation: Privilege escalation
  - Attack vectors: A local user can exploit this by establishing a user namespace, wait for a root process to enter that namespace with an unsafe uid or gid and then use ptrace system call.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user with the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability within their own user namespace.

CVE-2015-8551:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Missing device state validation in Xen PCI backend driver
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate device state validation
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash or disk space exhaustion)
  - Attack vectors: Guest kernel can cause a denial of service on the host by using a crafted sequence of XEN_PCI_OP_* operations with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Local guest administrator with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device in an x86 Xen System.

CVE-2015-8552:
 - Root cause of vulnerability: Missing device state validation in Xen PCI backend driver
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate device state validation
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (disk consumption) by generating a continuous stream of WARN messages.
  - Attack vectors: Local guest administrators to generate a continuous stream of WARN messages by using XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi operations with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Local guest administrator with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device in an x86 Xen System.

CVE-2015-8569:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Missing address length verification in pptp_bind and pptp_connect functions
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Missing input verification
  - Impact of exploitation: Information leak and bypass of KASLR
  - Attack vectors: A crafted application can trigger the vulnerability.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A local user.
