Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Adobe Flash parses MPEG-4 (MP4) files. Specifically, the issue occurs during the processing of MP4 files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** A specially crafted MP4 file can cause Adobe Flash to read memory beyond the allocated buffer. This is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, where the program attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The code execution occurs within the context of the current process (i.e., the Flash Player process).
*   This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system including data loss, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious web page containing a specially crafted MP4 file. When a user visits this page with a vulnerable version of Flash Player, the vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Malicious Files:** An attacker can distribute the malicious MP4 file via other means (e.g., email, USB drives). When the user opens this file in Adobe Flash, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the target machine; this vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attack requires some form of user interaction:
    *   The user must visit a malicious web page.
    *   The user must open a malicious MP4 file.
*   **Ability to craft a malicious MP4:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability using filter ID `22298`.
*   Adobe has released a patch to fix this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is described as a *memory corruption* vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution. The CVSS score is 6.8, indicating a medium to high severity.
