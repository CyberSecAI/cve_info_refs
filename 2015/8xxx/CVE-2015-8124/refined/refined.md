Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a session fixation issue within the "Remember Me" login feature of the Symfony framework. Specifically, when a user successfully logs in using the "Remember Me" functionality, the application does not generate a new session ID. This allows an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session fixation vulnerability: The application does not invalidate or regenerate the session ID (PHPSESSID cookie) after a successful "Remember Me" login.
- "Remember Me" functionality bypass: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended security mechanism of the "Remember Me" feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker who knows a victim's `PHPSESSID` can access the web application with the same privileges as the victim.
- Impersonation: The attacker can impersonate a legitimate user, gaining access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- Unauthorized access: Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially the entire web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid PHPSESSID cookie value of a legitimate user. This could be done through various means, such as:
    - Interception of network traffic.
    - XSS attacks.
    - Social engineering.
- The attacker can also set a specific PHPSESSID value in the victim's browser, potentially by a XSS attack or if they have physical access to the user's machine.
- Once the attacker has obtained or set the PHPSESSID value, they can access the application without needing to provide valid login credentials (if the "Remember Me" feature was used before), even if the session should be expired.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Knowledge of a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie: The attacker must somehow obtain a valid session ID of a user who logged in using "Remember Me" feature.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application and set cookies.
- "Remember Me" Feature Enabled: The application must have the "Remember Me" feature enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Symfony versions 2.3.0 to 2.3.34, 2.6.0 - 2.6.11, and 2.7.0 - 2.7.6.
- The fix involves migrating (regenerating) the session after a successful login via the "Remember Me" login feature.
- The risk is considered low due to the requirements to exploit, but the risk level can be increased depending on the sensitivity of the targeted web application.
- The `REMEMBERME` cookie itself was not directly compromised, the weakness is in how Symfony handle the `PHPSESSID` cookie in combination with `REMEMBERME`.
