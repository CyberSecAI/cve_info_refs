  "CVE-2015-8027": {
    "description": "This critical denial of service (DoS) vulnerability impacts all versions of v0.12.x through to v5.x, inclusive. The vulnerability was discovered by Node.js core team member Fedor Indutny and relates to HTTP pipelining. Under certain conditions an HTTP socket may no longer have a parser associated with it but a pipelined request can trigger a pause or resume on the non-existent parser thereby causing an `uncaughtException` to be thrown. As these conditions can be created by an external attacker and cause a Node.js service to be shut down we consider this a critical vulnerability.",
