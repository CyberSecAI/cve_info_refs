- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Huawei switches, when acting as HTTPS or SFTP servers, fail to properly release SSL session information from memory after a user logs out. Repeated logins and logouts eventually exhaust the allocated memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to improper handling of SSL session information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory exhaustion leading to device restart (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker repeatedly logs in and out of the HTTPS or SFTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the HTTPS or SFTP server.
