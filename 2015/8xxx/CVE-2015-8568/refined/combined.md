Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a full virtualization
solution on x86 hardware.

CVE-2015-7295

    Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network
    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service, that could
    occur when receiving large packets.

CVE-2015-7504

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.

CVE-2015-7512

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-7549

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360
    Inc. discovered that the PCI MSI-X emulator is vulnerable to a
    null pointer dereference issue, that could lead to
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8345

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
    denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8504

    Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

    vulnerable to double fetch vulnerabilities, possibly resulting in
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2015-8558

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
    loop during communication between the host controller and a device
    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion).

CVE-2015-8567 CVE-2015-8568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the vmxnet3 device
    emulator could be used to intentionally leak host memory, thus
    resulting in denial-of-service.

CVE-2015-8613

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the SCSI MegaRAID
    SAS HBA emulation support is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
    overflow issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash).

CVE-2015-8619

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the Human Monitor
    Interface support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound write access
    issue that could result in denial-of-service (via application
    crash).

CVE-2015-8743

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.

CVE-2015-8744

   The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes small packets, which could
   result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8745

   The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes Interrupt Mask Registers,
   which could result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2016-1568

    Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1714

    Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1922

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2016-1981

    The e1000 driver is vulnerable to an infinite loop issue that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u5a.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

This is not yet available at
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=history;f=hw/net/vmxnet3.c> but that
may be an expected place for a later update.

"does not check if the device is active before activating it" seems to
be similar to a CWE-372 ("Incomplete Internal State Distinction")
issue. Use CVE-2015-8567 for this aspect of the report.

"did not free the transmit & receive buffers while deactivating" seems
to be similar to a CWE-772 ("Missing Release of Resource after
Effective Lifetime") issue. Use CVE-2015-8568 for this aspect of the
report.

>> I've added a check in vmxnet3_deactivate_device() to avoid double free.

We think this may mean that the double free existed only in an early
version of the patch, and did not exist in any shipped QEMU code.
There is no CVE ID for the double free.
