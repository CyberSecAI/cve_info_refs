Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8568:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vmxnet3 device emulator in QEMU did not free the transmit & receive buffers when deactivating the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime (CWE-772)
- Memory leak due to the failure to free allocated transmit and receive buffers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) on the host system due to memory exhaustion, as a privileged guest user could repeatedly activate and deactivate the device to leak host memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged user inside a virtual guest machine can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a privileged user account within a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable QEMU instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to repeatedly activate and deactivate the vmxnet3 device.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically located in the `vmxnet3_deactivate_device()` function.
- The fix includes adding a check to see if the device is active before deactivating it and then freeing the transmit and receive buffers.

The provided content indicates that CVE-2015-8568 is related to a memory leak in the vmxnet3 device emulator, caused by not freeing allocated resources upon deactivation. This aligns with the description of CWE-772.
