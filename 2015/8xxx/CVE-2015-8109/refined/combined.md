IOActive Security Advisory

Title

System Update Created an Insecure Random Administrator
Password

Severity

Critical

Discovered by

Sofiane Talmat

Advisory Date

November 19, 2015

CVE

CVE-2015-8109

Affected Products

Lenovo System Update (Discovered in version 5.07.0013)

Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to acquire Administrator privileges on a machine by
predicting the username and password of the temporary Administrator account.

Background

This vulnerability allows a local unprivileged user to elevate privileges to Administrator or
SYSTEM. Since the user is running the System Update is an unprivileged user, the
SUService that is running as System will run the UACsdk.exe binary to create a temporary
Administrator account to run the GUI application (Tvsukernel.exe).

Lenovo creates a random temporary Administrator account with a username that follows the
template tvsu_tmp_xxxxxXXXXX, where each lowercase x is a randomly generated lower
case letter and each uppercase X is a randomly generated uppercase letter. A 19-byte,
random password is generated via an algorithm.

Technical Details

The execution flow is as follows:

The function sub_401810 accepts three arguments and is responsible for generating a
random alphanumeric username value with the third argument length.

The first call to this function generates 10 alphanumeric bytes as a suffix for the
Administrator username, following the template form tvsu_tmp_xxxxxXXXXX.

The function sub_401810 uses a predictable algorithm to generate the random
alphanumeric sequence based on a sequence of calls to the rand function after setting a
seed using the srand relaying on _time64 and an initial call to rand.

Due to this weakness, an attacker who knows the account creation time can predict the
generated username using the same algorithm.

Lenovo uses stronger random pattern generation (Method #1) for the password through the
function sub_401BE0 with Microsoft Crypto API CryptGenRandom. If Method #1 fails to
acquire Crypto Context (CryptAcquireContextW) or fails to generate either the random value
or the hash, the execution fails back to a call to sub_401810 and uses the previous
predictable rand-based algorithm to generate the password. In other words, an attacker
could predict the password created by Method #2.

In summary, an attacker could under certain circumstances predict both the username and
password of the temporary Administrator account and use this access to acquire
Administrator privileges on the machine.

Solution

Install the latest version of the Lenovo System Update application (version 5.06.0043 or
higher), which is available through System Update.

Lenovo also has issued an advisory about this vulnerability:
