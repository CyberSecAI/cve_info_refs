{
  "CVE-2015-8008": {
    "description": "The OAuth extension in MediaWiki did not properly enforce IP restrictions for a Consumer when using previously negotiated credentials. The IP restrictions were only applied when a new client token was negotiated through Special:OAuth/initiate, and were not enforced on subsequent API requests made with already existing tokens.",
    "root_cause": "The OAuth extension did not correctly check the IP address of the request against the IP restrictions configured for the OAuth consumer when using existing access tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of IP restrictions for OAuth consumers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass IP-based restrictions configured for an OAuth consumer and make API requests from unauthorized locations, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a valid OAuth access token for a consumer that has IP restrictions set can make API requests from outside the allowed IP ranges.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require a valid OAuth access token obtained through a legitimate consumer. The attacker needs to be outside the allowed IP range set for the consumer."
