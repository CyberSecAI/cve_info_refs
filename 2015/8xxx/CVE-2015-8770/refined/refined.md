Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8770

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue caused by insufficient sanitization of the `_skin` HTTP POST parameter in the `/index.php` script of Roundcube webmail. This parameter is used when changing between different skins of the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application does not properly validate user-supplied input for the `_skin` parameter, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** A remote, authenticated attacker can use path traversal sequences in the `_skin` parameter to load a skin from an arbitrary location on the server that is readable by the web server. This could expose sensitive information.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (under specific conditions):** If the `skin_include_php` configuration parameter is set to true, a remote, authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code embedded in a malicious skin file they've uploaded. This could lead to full server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/index.php` script with a malicious `_skin` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid user account for Roundcube.
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create files on the web server, which is common on shared hosting environments.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- The vulnerability affects Roundcube versions prior to 1.0.8 and 1.1.x prior to 1.1.4.
- Exploitation is more likely in shared hosting environments where users might have the ability to upload files on the server hosting the Roundcube application.
- The vulnerability can be used to read database credentials by including `<roundcube:var name="config:db_dsnw" />` in a skin file.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input for the `_skin` parameter to prevent path traversal.
