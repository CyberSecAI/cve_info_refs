  "cve_id": "CVE-2015-8351",
  "description": "The Gwolle Guestbook WordPress plugin before 1.5.4 has a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the 'abspath' HTTP GET parameter in frontend/captcha/ajaxresponse.php. This allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files and execute code by placing a malicious 'wp-load.php' file on their server and including its URL in the 'abspath' parameter.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the `abspath` HTTP GET parameter before it's used in a PHP `require()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization [CWE-98]"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the WordPress installation and possibly the entire web server.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "HTTP GET request",
       "details": "The 'abspath' parameter in the URL to the ajaxresponse.php file is used to include a remote file. The attacker provides a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file they control."
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": {
      "required_position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker",
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server. Needs a server to host the malicious PHP file. The 'allow_url_include' PHP setting needs to be enabled, or a local file path can be provided if it is disabled."
