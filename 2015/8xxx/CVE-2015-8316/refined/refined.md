Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8316:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how LightDM handles XDMCP Request packets when the `addresses` field is empty. Specifically, when receiving such a packet, LightDM attempts to access an array using a negative index, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Array index error:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds access due to using a negative index when handling XDMCP requests without addresses. This implies a lack of proper input validation or boundary checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of LightDM, effectively denying users access to the display manager. This can lead to system unavailability and disrupt user workflows.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted XDMCP request packet with an empty `addresses` field to a system running LightDM with the XDMCP server enabled.
*   **Malformed XDMCP request:** Specifically, sending an XDMCP request without a valid address field is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system where LightDM's XDMCP server is enabled.
*   **XDMCP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the XDMCP protocol to craft the malicious packet.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered only when the XDMCP server is enabled in `lightdm.conf`.
*   The problematic behavior was introduced by a change in bug 1481561.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during testing of a Stable Release Update (SRU) where the X server was sending malformed request packets.
*   Versions affected include LightDM 1.14.3, 1.16.0, 1.16.1, 1.16.2, 1.16.3, 1.16.4, and 1.16.5.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in LightDM versions 1.14.4, 1.16.6, and 1.17.2.
