### Bug Description

[Impact]

If LightDM receives an XDMCP Request packet with no addresses then it will attempt to access a negative index into an array and crash. This only occurs if the XDMCP server is enabled.

[Test Case]

1. Enable XDMCP in lightdm.conf:

[XDMCPServer]

enabled=true

2. Start LightDM

3. Send an XDMCP Request without an empty addresses field (valid XDMCP servers do not send this).

Expected result:

The request is ignored.

Observed result:

LightDM crashes.

lightdm looked ready to release in vivid, but I encountered this bug when looking through the comments. I marked [bug 1481561](/bugs/1481561) 'verification-failed' in response to your comment. Please mark the bug 'verification-done-vivid' if lightdm in vivid-proposed should still be released with any appropriate commentary.

Thanks,

The way I found this was by testing the SRU in vivid - for some reason the X server was sending Request packets with a addresses field empty. Other Ubuntu releases are not doing this. I haven't yet investigated if why it was doing this.

### Bug Description

[Impact]

If LightDM receives an XDMCP Request packet with no addresses then it will attempt to access a negative index into an array and crash. This only occurs if the XDMCP server is enabled.

[Test Case]

1. Enable XDMCP in lightdm.conf:

[XDMCPServer]

enabled=true

2. Start LightDM

3. Send an XDMCP Request without an empty addresses field (valid XDMCP servers do not send this).

Expected result:

The request is ignored.

Observed result:

LightDM crashes.

The way I found this was by testing the SRU in vivid - for some reason the X server was sending Request packets with a addresses field empty. Other Ubuntu releases are not doing this. I haven't yet investigated if why it was doing this.

Use CVE-2015-8316.

The scope of this CVE is only the LightDM behavior.
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/1516831/comments/6](https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/%2Bbug/1516831/comments/6) says "for
some reason the X server was sending Request packets with a addresses
field empty. Other Ubuntu releases are not doing this." There may be
other ongoing research into mishandling of an empty field, especially
because the "attack" is now inadvertently occurring in the wild. If
there's a related vulnerability in another independent display manager
(or if this is somehow a vulnerability in the X server) a different
CVE ID would be needed.
