Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the error handling of the `XENMEM_exchange` operation within the Xen hypervisor.
- Specifically, during error handling, a lock was being released incorrectly. This lock was either not acquired or had already been released on all paths leading to the error handling sequence.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect lock handling in the error path of the `XENMEM_exchange` operation.
- Unnecessary release of a lock that was not held.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious guest administrator could exploit this vulnerability to cause a deadlock in the host.
- A denial of service could be achieved by crashing the host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local to the hypervisor. A malicious guest administrator can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest administrator with the ability to interact with the `XENMEM_exchange` operation.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the specific error condition in `XENMEM_exchange` that leads to the incorrect lock release.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards.
- Mitigations involve controlling the guest kernel by the host and preventing the guest administrator from loading code into the kernel.
- A patch is available to resolve this issue.
