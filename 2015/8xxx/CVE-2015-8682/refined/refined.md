- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the Video0 driver of certain Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Video0 driver interface lacks adequate checks on incoming parameters, allowing an application to read arbitrary memory addresses. Specifically, a stack information leak vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can print stack memory content or cause a system crash by accessing invalid memory addresses.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. The malicious app then uses a vulnerable interface to read memory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious application. The attacker requires the victim to install the malicious app.
