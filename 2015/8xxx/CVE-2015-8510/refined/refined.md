Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8510

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the l10n (localization) library in Firefox OS handles HTML content within translations. Specifically, the DOM sanitizer was not recursively applied to child elements of elements that were only present in translations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** A specially crafted web page could inject arbitrary HTML into the homescreen app via the 'Add to home screen' functionality.
- **Bypassed DOM Sanitizer:** The DOM sanitizer, intended to prevent such injections, was bypassed due to the way it handled nested elements within translations. The sanitizer only checked for elements present in the source HTML, not within translated strings.
- **Missing Sanitization:** The localization code failed to sanitize the nested `<iframe>` tag within a `<s>` tag that was part of the translated application name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could execute an `<iframe>` element controlled by them with homescreen privileges.
- **System Compromise:** This elevated access could lead to further system compromise by the attacker. The `<iframe>` could be used to access other parts of the system with the same privileges as the homescreen app, which has significant system permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **'Add to Home Screen' Functionality:** The attacker tricks a user into bookmarking a malicious web page using the "Add to home screen" feature.
- **Web Manifest:** The malicious webpage uses a specially crafted application name in its web manifest which includes malicious HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Webpage:** The attacker needs to host a webpage containing the malicious manifest.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to add the malicious webpage to their home screen.
- **Firefox OS User:** Target must be using a vulnerable version of Firefox OS.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was triggered by crafting a web manifest with an application name containing `<s>PoC<iframe src=app://fm.gaiamobile.org/index.html mozbrowser></iframe>`.
- The `<s>` tag was not present in the source HTML, so the l10n library did not sanitize the `<iframe>` tag nested within it.
- The `<iframe>` was then executed with the privileges of the homescreen app, effectively escalating privileges.
- The fix involves recursively calling the sanitization logic on child elements of allowed elements even if they are present only in the translations.

**Affected Products:**
- Firefox OS

**Fixed in:**
- Firefox OS 2.5
