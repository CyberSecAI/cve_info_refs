## Up.time agent for Linux does not authenticate a user before allowing read access to the file system

#### Vulnerability Note VU#204232

Original Release Date: 2016-05-19 | Last Revised: 2016-06-14

---

### Overview

The up.time agent for Linux versions 7.5 and 7.6 may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to read arbitrary files from a system.

### Description

| [**CWE-306**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function -** CVE-2015-8268  According to the researcher, "The linux based uptime.agent version 7.5 provides the ability to remotely read any file on the remote system that the uptime.agent has read access to, without authentication." Idera has identified that versions 7.5 and 7.6 are affected.Related vulnerabilities were initially reported in [VU#377260.](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/377260) |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote user may be able to read arbitrary files from a system running the Up.time agent for Linux. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Idera has released [Up.time version 7.7](http://docs.uptimesoftware.com/display/UT/Release%2BNotes) which addresses this issue. Affected users are encouraged to update to the latest available version as soon as possible.Affected users should also consider the following mitigations for this and other vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

| **Check configuration**According to Idera, affected users may also use the following configuration settings to mitigate these issues:1. All agents run in a read only mode by default, where they can only poll metrics.2. In order to use custom scripts or trigger recovery actions, you need to set a password on the agent, or add commands to the .uptmpasswd file for the linux agent.3. Agents communication can be encrypted with SSL by using various SSL Tunneling/Proxy Utilities (openSSL, etc). [KB articles](http://docs.uptimesoftware.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4555083) cover the specifics for implementing with Stunnel on various platforms.4. Agents running under xinet.d can also be secured at the service level by restricting incoming connections to only accept connections from the Monitoring Station, or limit the total number of connections, etc.5. Disable Agent Commands you don't use either via the Agent Console or editing conf/agent\_commands.txt. |
