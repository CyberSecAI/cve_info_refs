Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8622:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from allowing the `$wgArticlePath` configuration setting in MediaWiki to be set to a relative path that does not begin with a slash, specifically `$wgArticlePath = '$1'`.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** When `$wgArticlePath` is set to `$1`, it becomes trivially possible to inject JavaScript code via wiki links.
*   If a user creates a page named `javascript:alert('XSS!')` and then adds a wikilink to that page on another page using `[[javascript:alert('XSS!')]]`, the generated HTML will include `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS!')" ...>`, leading to the execution of the JavaScript code.

**Impact:**

*   Successful exploitation results in arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vector:**

*   An attacker needs to create a page with a malicious name (e.g., `javascript:alert('XSS!')`).
*   The attacker then needs to create a link to this page from another page within the wiki.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and edit pages on the MediaWiki instance.

**Affected Versions:**

*   MediaWiki versions 1.23, 1.24, 1.25 and 1.26 are affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in MediaWiki 1.26.1, 1.25.4, 1.24.5, and 1.23.12 by ensuring that `$wgArticlePath` cannot be set to a relative path not starting with a slash.
*   The fix involves validating the `$wgArticlePath` configuration and throwing an error if an invalid value is set.
