{
  "CVE-2015-8786": {
    "Description": "The Management plugin in RabbitMQ before 3.6.1 allows remote authenticated users with certain privileges to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via the (1) lengths_age or (2) lengths_incr parameter.",
    "Root cause": "The Management plugin in RabbitMQ did not validate the `lengths_age` and `lengths_incr` parameters provided by users, allowing for the potential of excessive resource consumption.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Unvalidated user input",
      "Resource exhaustion",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote authenticated user with specific privileges can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exploiting the lack of input validation and causing excessive resource consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "HTTP API"
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be a remote authenticated user with sufficient privileges to access the RabbitMQ HTTP API."
  }
