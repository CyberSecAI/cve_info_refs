## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Description

[![@jemc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4623870?u=14511f07ed8cdebaa4570b016cdfe911522a2053&v=4&size=48)](/jemc)[jemc](https://github.com/jemc)opened [on Jun 23, 2015](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/7#issue-90512174)

I've been having some issues with the federation plugin (that, incidentally, may have to do with dynamic reconfiguration), so I thought I would clone the repository, get the test suite running locally, and try to make a failing test for my issue (which I'm still trying to pinpoint to a minimal reproduction).

However, when running the test suite locally, the tests hang indefinitely at `rabbit_federation_exchange_test`:`dynamic_reconfiguration`

```
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-public-umbrella.git
cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
make co
cd rabbitmq-federation
make test
```

```

[`9c33c70`](/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/commit/9c33c701fa496826b53a7a387da3b5e4beaa6e87)

## RabbitMQ 3.6.1

RabbitMQ `3.6.1` is a maintenance release that includes a fix for [CVE-2015-8786](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c22c-f732-2pwg "CVE-2015-8786"),

a vulnerability in RabbitMQ management plugin.

### Server

#### Bug Fixes

* Purging a lazy queue could result in an exception

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#514](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/514)
* Ensure `epmd` is running before starting RabbitMQ node on Windows

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#625](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/625)
* Channel error could make broker unreachable

  Those errors were misleadingly logged as `channel_termination_timeout`, which

  the issue really was with unhandled messages from concurrently closed TCP socket process.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#530](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/530)
* (Automatic) deletion of an auto-delete queue could lead

  to blocked channels

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#581](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/581)
* During (from scratch) queue sync, queue master node didn't respect mirror alarm state.

  With large data sets this could drive mirror node out of memory.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#616](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/616)
* Changing password for users with non-standard (think broker configuration) password

  hashing function, for example, those migrated from `3.5.x` releases, didn't update

  effective hashing function.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#623](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/623)
* Heavy and/or prolonged `rabbitmqctl` use could exhaust Erlang VM atom table

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#549](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/549)
* "Min masters" queue master location strategy could result

  in an error.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#521](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/521)
* Fixed a race condition in `pause_minority` handling mode.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#307](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/307)
* Significantly reduce possibility of a race condition when

  an exchange is deleted and immediately re-declared, e.g. by a federation

  link.

  This could result in a link operation being blocked, preventing

  nodes from stopping.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-federation#7](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/7)
* `amq.rabbitmq.log` messages now have information about originating

  node in message headers

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#595](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/595)
* `scripts/rabbitmq-env` now works with GNU sed 4.2.2

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#592](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/592)
* Exceptions in VM memory use calculator no longer affect broker startup

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#328](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/328)
* [Direct Reply-to](https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html) capability is now advertised to clients

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#520](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/520)

#### Enhancements

* Paths with non-ASCII characters on Windows are now handled

  RabbitMQ now can be installed into a location with non-ASCII characters,

  e.g. when username contains them.

  GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-server#493](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/493)
* Configurable number of TCP connection acceptors

  Plus a x10 increase of the default. This helps with workloads where connection

  churn is very high (e.g. all clients are PHP Web apps that cannot maintain

  long-lived connections).

  GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-server#528](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/528)
* `rabbitmqctl cluster_status` now includes cluster-wide resource alarm status

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#392](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/392)
* Windows installer no longer jumps over installation log

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#634](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/634)
* Improved `rabbitmqctl reset` error messages

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#167](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/167)
* More unsigned field data types are supported.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-server#20](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/20)

### Java client

#### Enhancements

* Endpoints (hostnames) are now also accepted as a `java.util.List`

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-java-client#125](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/125)
* Autorecovering connections now shuffle hosts in a more

  reliable way

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-java-client#124](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/124)

#### Bug Fixes

* Binding recovery could fail

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-java-client#129](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/129)
* `Channel.queueDelete` could throw a `NullPointerException`

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-java-client#120](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/120)

### .NET client

#### Bug Fixes

* Autorecovering connections now use full list of provided hostnames

  during recovery

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-dotnet-client#153](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/153)

### Federation Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* Significantly reduce possibility of a race condition when

  an exchange is deleted and immediately re-declared, e.g. by a federation

  link

  This rendered federation links dysfunctional.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-federation#7](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/7)

### Management plugin

#### Vulnerability Fixes

* [CVE-2015-8786](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c22c-f732-2pwg "CVE-2015-8786"): user-provided query parameters `lengths_age` and `lengths_incr` had no validation

  and could be used to exhaust server resources.

  The attacker needs to have access to HTTP API (authenticate successfully and have sufficient

  tags to pass authorisation) in order to carry out the attack.

  There is no workaround for earlier releases.

  Kudos to Vladimir Ivanov (Positive Technologies) for the responsible disclosure.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#97](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/97)

#### Enhancements

* Password hashing function is now included in exported definitions

  Those upgrading from versions earlier than `3.6.0` via definitions export

  won't have to temporarily set hashing function to MD5 to ensure export succeeds.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#117](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/117)

#### Bug Fixes

* Internet Explorer (9+) compatibility restored

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#98](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/98)
* Internet Explorer 11 compatibility fixes

  GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-management#112](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/112),

  [rabbitmq-management#114](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/114)
* When policy fails to be created with invalid paramaters a sensible

  error message will be displayed.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-management#110](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/110)

### Federation Management plugin

#### Enhancements

* Federation link form now includes more settings (that are exchange- and queue-federation specific)

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-federation-management#5](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation-management/issues/5)

### Erlang client

#### Bug Fixes

* `password` and `depth` query parameters are now propagated to TLS options

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-erlang-client#36](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client/issues/36)

### STOMP plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* `durable` and `persistent` headers weren't always used interchangeably,

  leading to non-durable subscriptions

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-stomp#58](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stomp/issues/58)
* Client heartbeat timeouts resulted in confusing error messages

  in broker log.

  GitHub issues: [rabbitmq-stomp#63](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stomp/issues/63)

### Web STOMP plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* Cowboy options are now supported for TLS listeners.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-web-stomp#36](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp/issues/36)

### Web STOMP Examples plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* Multi-byte UTF-8 characters are now handled

  by the bundled version of stomp.js.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples#2](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp-examples/issues/2)

### Event Exchange plugin

#### Bug Fixes

* Event timestamps are now in seconds, not milliseconds

  Per AMQP 0-9-1 spec. This is not a particularly great choice for events,

  so we will add an optional header with millisecond precision in a future release.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-event-exchange#8](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-event-exchange/issues/8)

### JSON RPC plugin

Note: this plugin is deprecated and its use is highly discouraged.

#### Enhancements

* RabbitmQ `3.6.x` support.

  GitHub issue: [rabbitmq-jsonrpc#3](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jsonrpc/issues/3)

## Upgrading

To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ simply install the new version. All configuration and persistent message data are retained. When upgrading using definitions export/import from versions earlier than 3.6.0, see <http://rabbitmq.com/passwords.html>.

To upgrade a RabbitMQ cluster, follow the instructions [in RabbitMQ documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading).
