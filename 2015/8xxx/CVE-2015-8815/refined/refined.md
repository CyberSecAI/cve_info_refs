- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Umbraco CMS is vulnerable to persistent XSS in the content type editor. Specifically, the `name` field of the media page, the developer data edit page, and the form page do not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `name` field of the media page, developer data edit page, or form page through the content type editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit content types in the Umbraco CMS, which implies having sufficient privileges.
