Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8256

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input validation in multiple parameters of the Axis network camera web interface. This allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:** Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Injecting JavaScript into a vulnerable parameter, which is then stored in the system logs. When a user views the log, the injected JavaScript is executed in their browser.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Injecting JavaScript into a parameter in a URL, which is then reflected back and executed in the user's browser.
*   **CSRF:** The advisory also mentions the presence of CSRF vulnerability which when combined with XSS allows performing actions like user creation/deletion, application management, etc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser session of a user who interacts with the vulnerable pages.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can potentially be used to steal session cookies or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** With the combination of CSRF, attackers can perform privileged actions such as user and application management.
*   **Device Manipulation:** The attacker can modify device configurations, delete applications, or carry out other unauthorized operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URLs:** Attackers can craft URLs containing malicious JavaScript code injected into vulnerable parameters.
    *   Examples:
        *   `/axis-cgi/vaconfig.cgi?action=get&name=<script>...</script>`
        *   `/axis-cgi/admin/systemlog.cgi?id` (triggered after stored XSS)
        *   `/view/view.shtml?imagePath=0WLL</script><script>alert('AXIS-XSS')</script><!--`
        *   `/admin/config.shtml?group=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E`
        *   `/view/custom_whiteBalance.shtml?imagePath=<img src="xs" onerror=alert(7) /><!--`
        *   `/admin-bin/editcgi.cgi?file=<script>alert('SmithW')</script>`
        *   `/operator/recipient_test.shtml?protocol=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E`
        *   `/admin/showReport.shtml?content=alwaysmulti.sdp&pageTitle=axis</title></head><body><pre><script>alert(1)</script>`
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery:**  Using CSRF to trigger privileged actions using XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable Axis network camera's web interface.
*   **Social Engineering (Potentially):** To trigger stored XSS, the attacker may need to trick a user into viewing a page containing the malicious javascript. For reflected XSS they need to trick the user into clicking the malicious url.
*   **Basic Knowledge of JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to write basic JavaScript code for injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory lists multiple affected script paths, showing that the XSS vulnerability is widespread across the web interface.
*   The vendor, Axis Communications, did not provide a solution or respond to the issue at the time of the advisory release.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description which would simply state that there is a XSS vulnerability. The advisory goes into depth about specific parameters, attack vectors and the full impact of the vulnerability.
