Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8853:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within Perl's regular expression matching engine. When processing malformed UTF-8 input, the regex engine can enter an infinite loop. Specifically, the engine tries to backtrack over a sequence of UTF-8 continuation bytes without the preceding start byte which constitutes malformed UTF-8 input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of malformed UTF-8 sequences in the regular expression matching logic.
- The regex engine fails to detect and gracefully handle invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, leading to an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop consumes 100% CPU, causing the affected Perl process to hang indefinitely, which leads to a denial of service. This can bring down web applications that utilize Perl's regex engine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing crafted, malformed UTF-8 input to a Perl script that uses regular expression matching on that input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious input to the vulnerable perl application
- No special privileges are required. The attack can be triggered locally or remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Perl versions prior to the fix.
- Patches were released to correct the issue, specifically the commit `22b433eff9a1ffa2454e18405a56650f07b385b5`.
- The issue was reported in various distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu
- The vulnerability is present when `binmode :utf8` is used.
- Oracle Solaris was also affected by this issue.
