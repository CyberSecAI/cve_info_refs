Guidelines:
1. First verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description
2. If the content does not relate to this CVE, respond with "UNRELATED"
3. If no useful vulnerability information is found, respond with "NOINFO" 
4. For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position

Additional instructions:
- Preserve original technical details and descriptions
- Remove unrelated content
- Translate non-English content to English
- Note if the content provides more detail than the official CVE description

{
  "CVE-2015-8381": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow due to duplicate named references within PCRE.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PCRE library when handling duplicate named references in regular expressions.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution via a specially crafted regular expression.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious regular expression that exploits the buffer overflow during the compile phase of PCRE.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious regular expression to an application that uses PCRE and is vulnerable to this flaw."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the way PCRE handles duplicate named references within a regular expression during compilation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs in PCRE when processing regular expressions with duplicate named groups.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition or possibly execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by providing a specially crafted regular expression.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker provides a malicious regular expression to an application that uses PCRE.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or influence the regular expression used by an application utilizing the vulnerable PCRE library. The specific application will determine the position and capabilities required."
