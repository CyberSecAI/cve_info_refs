Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Redmine handles flash messages. When rendering these messages, the application unconditionally marks them as HTML safe using `html_safe`. This means that any HTML special characters within the flash message are not escaped and are rendered as raw HTML, unless manually escaped beforehand.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied values, when included in flash messages, are rendered without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that can be executed in the victim's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Redmine fails to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input before displaying it in a flash message.
- **Unconditional html_safe:** The usage of `html_safe` without proper context-aware escaping is a security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts into flash messages, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session. This could lead to actions performed on behalf of the user, data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Attackers can craft specific inputs (like a specially crafted email address) that trigger the XSS vulnerability when an action, like test mail, is performed. This allows for targeted attacks against specific users, such as administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability is reflected, meaning the malicious input is sent to the server and then reflected back to the user's browser in the flash message.
- **User-Supplied Input:**  The vulnerability is triggered when user-supplied values (e.g., email address, potentially other form inputs that are used in flash messages) are rendered within the flash message without proper escaping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to perform a specific action that will trigger the vulnerable code path that includes the malicious user-supplied input in the flash message. This could include visiting a page with a crafted url, or a user triggering a function with a user supplied parameter that is not sanitized before being reflected back in a flash message
- **Ability to manipulate input:** The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate input that will be displayed in a flash message. In the provided example this was possible by controlling the email address, but other user inputs might lead to a similar result.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability existed in Redmine since at least version 2.3, and possibly earlier.
- The fix involved proper escaping of user-provided data in flash messages before rendering.
- The severity was initially considered low, but later recognized as a more significant risk.
- The vulnerability is associated with Redmine issue #19117.
- Fixed in Redmine versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.0.
