- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IBM SPSS Statistics ActiveX Control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an overly long argument passed to the `Initialize` function of the ActiveX control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by persuading a victim to visit a specially crafted webpage that triggers the overflow. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system or a browser crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage that passes an overly long argument to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and persuade a victim to visit it in order to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to craft the malicious input for the `Initialize` function.
