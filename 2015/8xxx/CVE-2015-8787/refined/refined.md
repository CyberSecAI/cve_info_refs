{
  "CVE-2015-8787": {
    "Description": "The netfilter Network Address Translation (NAT) implementation did not ensure that data structures were initialized when handling IPv4 addresses. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nf_nat_redirect_ipv4` function in `net/netfilter/nf_nat_redirect.c` did not properly validate if the interface address (`ifa`) was initialized before dereferencing it, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Lack of proper data structure initialization",
      "Use of uninitialized data"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted IPv4 packets to an incompletely configured interface.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote, and no authentication is required"
  }
}
