# Roundcube: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Roundcube allowing
remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code, inject arbitrary web
scripts, and perform cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/roundcube** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.4** |

### Background

Free and open source webmail software for the masses, written in PHP.

### Description

Remote authenticated users with certain permissions can read arbitrary
files or possibly execute arbitrary code via .. in the \_skin parameter to
index.php. Additionally, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
program/js/app.js allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the file name in a drag-n-drop file upload.

### Impact

A remote authenticated user could possibly execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, read
arbitrary files, or perform XSS.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Roundcube users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/roundcube-1.1.4”

```

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for roundcubemail
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:1904-1
Rating: moderate
References: #938840 #952006
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
Description:
roundcubemail was updated to version 1.0.7 to fix two security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- XSS issue in drag-n-drop file uploads
- Disallow unwanted access on files in the file system. The apache2
configuration file for roundcubemail allowed access to the
roundcubemail/bin folder and possibly /logs, /config and /temp, if these
were not symlinks (this was only the case when the configuration was
manually changed) (bsc#952006)
The package comes with a fixed configuration. If you modified the file
"/etc/apache2/conf.d/roundcubemail.conf", please replace it with the
configuration "roundcubemail.conf.rpmnew" and reapply your changes. After
that, a restart of apache2 is requried.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-699=1
- openSUSE 13.1:

To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
