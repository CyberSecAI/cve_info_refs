Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-8105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from two issues:
    1. **Path traversal:** A vulnerability in `index.php` allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files or possibly execute arbitrary code using `..` in the `_skin` parameter.
    2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A flaw exists in `program/js/app.js` where remote authenticated users can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML via the file name during drag-and-drop file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `_skin` parameter, allowing traversal outside of the intended directory.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize the file name during drag-and-drop file uploads, enabling the injection of malicious scripts.
   - **Insecure File Access:** The original Apache2 configuration allowed access to the `roundcubemail/bin` folder and potentially `/logs`, `/config`, and `/temp` directories if they were not symlinks (this is specific to the openSUSE content).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server process through the path traversal vulnerability.
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server due to the path traversal flaw.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other client-side exploits by injecting script to other users of the application.
    - **Information Disclosure:** The insecure access allowed in the apache2 configuration could expose sensitive application data in the `/logs`, `/config`, and `/temp` directories (openSUSE specific).

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate HTTP requests by injecting `..` sequences into the `_skin` parameter in the URL or the request body.
    - **Malicious File Uploads:** Attackers use the drag-and-drop file upload functionality to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML by crafting file names with malicious payloads.
   - **Direct access** to the `/bin` folder and potentially `/logs`, `/config`, and `/temp` directories via HTTP requests if the Apache2 configuration allows it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Authentication:** Attackers must be authenticated users of the Roundcube webmail application. This means they need a valid user account.
  - **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the server hosting the Roundcube application.

**Additional Details:**
   - The Gentoo advisory specifies that the code execution is "possible" while openSUSE advisory confirms that access to files in the file system could be used for file read and code execution.
   - The OpenSUSE advisory provides information on an additional configuration vulnerability, not mentioned in the Gentoo advisory related to the original Apache configuration file.
    - OpenSUSE advisory specifies that roundcubemail was updated to version 1.0.7 to fix these issues.
    - Gentoo advisory specifies that the affected version of roundcubemail is < 1.1.4.
