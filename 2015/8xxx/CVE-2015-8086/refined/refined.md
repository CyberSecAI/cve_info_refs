- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Encryption keys are stored within the system, which can be obtained by reverse engineering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure storage of encryption keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain encryption keys through reverse engineering, leading to the decryption of passwords and other sensitive data, resulting in user information leaks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have network access and high administrative privileges to perform reverse engineering and obtain the encryption keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and high administrative privileges, which allows reverse engineering to access stored encryption keys.
