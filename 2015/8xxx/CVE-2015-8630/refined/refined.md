{
  "CVE-2015-8630": {
    "Description": "The (1) kadm5_create_principal_3 and (2) kadm5_modify_principal functions in lib/kadm5/srv/svr_principal.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.12.x and 1.13.x before 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) by specifying KADM5_POLICY with a NULL policy name.",
    "Root cause": "The kadm5_create_principal_3() and kadm5_modify_principal() functions in kadmind do not check if a policy is given when KADM5_POLICY is set in the mask, leading to a null pointer dereference if a null policy is supplied.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing null check on policy value"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker with permissions to modify a principal with a null policy can cause a null pointer dereference, leading to the kadmind service crashing, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with permissions to modify the database.",
        "Additional Information": "This vulnerability was present in MIT krb5 1.12 and later. The issue occurs when KADM5_POLICY is included in the mask, but a null policy value is provided. The vulnerability is fixed in krb5 1.13.4 and 1.14.1."
