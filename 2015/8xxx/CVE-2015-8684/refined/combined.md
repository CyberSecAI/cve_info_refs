  Fix security issue by strengthening the server security parameters
  in folders receiving uploads and tighten elFinder security by not
  allow any files to be opened (only folders)...you'll need to use
  the 'preview' or 'edit' commands or click on the link in the 'info'
  dialog which will enforce the server security settings.[[#1323](/projects/61783/tickets/1323 "Ticket #1323")
