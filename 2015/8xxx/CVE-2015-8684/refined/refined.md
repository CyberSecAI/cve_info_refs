Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input during file uploads in Exponent CMS. Specifically, the application does not properly handle HTML files uploaded through the file manager, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or encode user-provided input when a user uploads a file, particularly HTML files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within the file, which are then stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By uploading a malicious HTML file, an attacker can inject client-side scripts (JavaScript) that can be executed within the browsers of other users when they access the uploaded file through the file manager. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies/session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   Modifying content within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is the file upload functionality within the Exponent CMS file manager.
*   **HTML file inclusion:** Specifically uploading/including an HTML file into the file manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload files through the file manager.
*   **Upload access:**  The attacker needs access to the file upload functionality in the CMS.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found in Exponent CMS version 2.3.5 and was addressed in later versions.
*   The fix involved "strengthening the server security parameters in folders receiving uploads and tighten elFinder security by not allow any files to be opened (only folders)". Accessing files now requires using 'preview' or 'edit' commands or clicking a link in the info dialog, enforcing the server security settings.
*   A Proof of Concept (POC) video is also attached.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sachin Wagh.
