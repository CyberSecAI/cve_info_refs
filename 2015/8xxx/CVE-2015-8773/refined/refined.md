{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The McAfee File Lock Driver (McPvDrv.sys) does not correctly handle GUIDs of encrypted vaults, leading to a kernel stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Kernel stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing vault GUIDs.",
    "A second stack buffer overflow exists when concatenating the device name and GUID."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a system crash (BSoD). While return addresses are protected by a security cookie, preventing further exploitation beyond crashing, it could still disrupt system availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted IOCTL with a malformed Vault GUID is sent to the vulnerable driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to send a crafted IOCTL to the driver. This requires the ability to interact with the driver which is typically available to a local user with some level of privilege"
