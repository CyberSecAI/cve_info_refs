{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `ljpeg_decode_yuv_scan` function in `libavcodec/mjpegdec.c` in FFmpeg omits certain width and height checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds array access"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, possibly unspecified other impact.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted MJPEG data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide crafted MJPEG data.",
    "additional_info": "The issue is fixed by adding a check for index to avcodec/mjpegdec.c in ljpeg_decode_yuv_scan() before using it, which fixes an out of array access."
