Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8979:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the size of data structures received over the network by the `dcmtk` library, specifically within the `parsePresentationContext` function in the `storescp` application. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper checks on the length of the received ACSE data structures, which can cause overflows or underflows during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** Sending a long string to TCP port 4242 can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in the `parsePresentationContext` function.
- **Incorrect length handling:** The code fails to adequately validate the length of ACSE data structures received over the network, which leads to memory corruption.
- **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending crafted network packets to a vulnerable server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial-of-service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a segmentation fault, resulting in a crash of the application (`storescp`), leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system, though this is less certain from the information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers send crafted network packets with long strings to TCP port 4242, where the `storescp` application listens for incoming DICOM network connections.
- **DICOM protocol:** The vulnerability arises when processing DICOM network connections, where the data structures being read and processed are not validated properly for length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of DICOM protocol:** Although not explicitly stated, the attacker may need some understanding of the DICOM protocol structure to create the malicious data.
- **Ability to craft packets:** The attacker needs the capability to generate and send malicious network packets to the target application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects `dcmtk` version 3.6.0 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `dcmtk` version 3.6.1~20160216-2 and later.
- The exploit is triggered by sending an oversized "A-ASSOCIATE PDU".
- The `storescp` application is specifically mentioned as being vulnerable.
