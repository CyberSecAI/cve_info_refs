- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server is vulnerable to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The server is susceptible to a denial-of-service attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the service to shut down by sending specially-crafted packets to the target's TCP port.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks by sending specially-crafted packets to the target's TCP port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network packets to the server's TCP port.
