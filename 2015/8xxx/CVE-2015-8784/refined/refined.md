Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8784:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `NeXTDecode()` function within the LibTIFF library when handling malformed TIFF images. Specifically, the decoding process could write beyond allocated buffer limits. The vulnerability was triggered by a specially crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds write** in the `NeXTDecode()` function. This occurs due to incorrect bounds checking during the decoding process which writes beyond the allocated buffer size. This could lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can lead to application crashes and instability, causing a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some instances, an attacker could potentially leverage memory corruption to achieve arbitrary code execution. The code execution would be with the privileges of the user running the application using the vulnerable LibTIFF library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF Image:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted TIFF image that triggers the vulnerability when processed by an application using the affected `NeXTDecode()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide malicious TIFF file:** An attacker needs to be able to somehow get the victim to open a malicious TIFF image.
- **No specific privilege is required:** The vulnerability is triggered by simply processing the malicious TIFF.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported in bugzilla #2508 and addressed with a fix in `tif_next.c`
- Affected components include the `libtiff` library and potentially applications that make use of it for image processing
- The issue was present in multiple distros, including Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- Patches have been provided by the upstream developers to fix the issue.
