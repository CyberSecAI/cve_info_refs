- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The embedded web application of AXIS devices does not verify whether a request was intentionally submitted by the user, due to a design flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can forge requests to the web interface and execute administrative actions such as setting/changing the root password, creating new user credentials, or deleting applications.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends requests to the vulnerable AXIS device web interface. If a user is logged into the device and opens the malicious HTML page, the forged requests will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious HTML page to a user of the vulnerable AXIS device. The user needs to be logged into the device web interface when opening the malicious HTML page.
