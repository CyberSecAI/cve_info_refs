Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2015-8368:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ntop-ng application's failure to properly validate user identity during password reset requests. Specifically, the application trusts the 'username' and 'user' cookie parameters in a password reset request, which can be modified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the username and user cookie data, allowing an attacker to supply an arbitrary admin username.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows a low-privilege user to escalate their privileges to an administrator by modifying the parameters of a password reset request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Control of Application:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete administrative access to the ntop-ng application.
- **Potential Data Breach/Manipulation:**  An attacker with administrative access could potentially access sensitive network traffic data monitored by ntop-ng, alter configurations, or even inject malicious code into the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts a password reset request from a legitimate low-privilege user.
- **Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the intercepted request by changing the "username" parameter and the "user" cookie to the admin account values.
- **Replay Attack:** The modified request is then replayed to the server, triggering the password reset for the admin account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the ntop-ng server, either through a man-in-the-middle attack or by being on the same network.
- **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs access to a non-privileged user account on the ntop-ng application.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Requires an understanding of HTTP request manipulation and how password reset mechanisms work.

**Summary:** The vulnerability in ntop-ng allows an attacker with a low-privilege user account to escalate to administrator privileges by intercepting and manipulating a password reset request. This is due to the application's failure to validate the 'username' parameter and 'user' cookie in password reset requests.
