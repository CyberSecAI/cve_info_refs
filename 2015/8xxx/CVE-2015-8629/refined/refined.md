Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8629:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-8629 and includes details about the vulnerability, its impact, and affected components. The descriptions align with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `xdr_nullstring()` function within the `lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c` file of the MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) kadmind service. This function doesn't properly validate if a decoded string is null-terminated and does not contain internal null bytes.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The `xdr_nullstring` function fails to ensure that the decoded strings are properly null-terminated and do not contain internal null bytes.
    *   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** Due to the lack of proper null termination validation, kadmind might read beyond allocated memory.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Authenticated attackers with permission to modify the Kerberos database might be able to leak sensitive information by sending crafted strings.
    *   **Denial of Service:** An authenticated attacker could cause a denial of service by repeatedly sending requests with crafted strings, causing kadmind to exhaust available memory or read beyond allocated memory bounds and possibly crashing the service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
    *   **Authenticated:** The attacker requires valid Kerberos authentication.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:**  An attacker needs to have valid Kerberos credentials to communicate with the kadmind service.
    *   **Database Modification Permission (for Information Leak):** To exploit the vulnerability for information disclosure, the attacker may need permissions to modify database entries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) prior to 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1.
*   Several vendors (e.g. Oracle, SUSE, Red Hat, Debian, openSUSE) have released security advisories and updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The provided code from github indicates that a fix for this vulnerability validates null termination and lack of internal null bytes via `memchr` in xdr_nullstring.
*   Some sources rate the severity as "Moderate" with low CVSS scores (2.1-5.3), but RedHat scores it as Moderate with higher impact to confidentiality, while other scores it as High with a CVSS score of 7.2

**CVE-2015-8629 analysis details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Incomplete validation of null termination and internal null bytes in xdr_nullstring function of kadmind service, which can cause information leak or DoS.
*   **Affected Software:** MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) before 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Access Complexity:** High
*   **Authentication:** Single
*  **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial
*   **Integrity Impact:** None
*   **Availability Impact:** None
