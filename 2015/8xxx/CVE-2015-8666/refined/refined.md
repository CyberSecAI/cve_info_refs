Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-8666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in QEMU when using the Q35 chipset-based PC system emulator during VM guest migration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: More data is moved during VM migration than the allocated memory area can hold, resulting in memory corruption. Specifically, 16 bytes of data were being moved to a location allocated for 8 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A privileged guest user can potentially corrupt the VM guest image.
- This corruption can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during VM guest migration, making it an attack vector specific to that operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user inside the guest VM.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Q35 machine types.
- A patch was released upstream to address this issue.
- Red Hat stated that this issue does not affect the versions of `kvm` and `xen` packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the `qemu-kvm` packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, or the `qemu-kvm-rhev` packages in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.
