*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper application of whitelist restrictions for URLs using HTTP and HTTPS protocols in Apache Cordova Android applications. Whitelist cannot block network redirects from a whitelisted remote website to a non-whitelisted website.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient validation of redirects, allowing a whitelisted site to redirect to a non-whitelisted site, bypassing the intended security controls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially redirect users to a malicious website from a whitelisted site.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network redirects from a whitelisted domain to a non-whitelisted domain.

**CVE-2015-5257:**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak randomization of the BridgeSecret used to protect the communication bridge between the native application and the HTML/JavaScript user interface in Apache Cordova Android.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can be determined in certain scenarios.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could hijack the bridge and potentially gain control over the application.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the insufficient randomness of the BridgeSecret.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to determine the BridgeSecret.
