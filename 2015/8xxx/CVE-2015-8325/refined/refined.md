Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8325:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `do_setup_env` function within `session.c` of OpenSSH. When the `UseLogin` option is enabled in `sshd_config` and PAM is configured to read user-specified environment variables (e.g., from `~/.pam_environment`), OpenSSH fetches these PAM environment settings *before* executing the `/bin/login` program. This allows a malicious local user to manipulate the environment, potentially injecting malicious code through mechanisms like `LD_PRELOAD`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Improper Input Validation:** OpenSSH does not adequately validate the PAM environment variables before launching the login program.
* **Privilege Escalation:** This allows a local unprivileged user to escalate to root privileges by exploiting the login process with malicious environment variables.
* **Use of Login Program:** The vulnerability is specific to configurations where `UseLogin=yes` is set, making the system reliant on the `/bin/login` program.
* **PAM Configuration Dependency:**  The exploit also relies on the PAM configuration allowing reading of user-specified environment files (e.g., `~/.pam_environment`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code as root.
* **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can result in complete system compromise by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Attack:** A malicious local user can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating their PAM environment.
* **Environment Variable Injection:** Specifically, the attacker injects malicious code into the environment via PAM, such as `LD_PRELOAD`, which is then used when the login program is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local Access:** The attacker requires a local user account on the vulnerable system.
* **Configuration Dependence:** The exploit requires specific non-default configurations:
    - `UseLogin=yes` in sshd_config.
    - PAM configuration that enables reading of user-specified environment variables.
* **PAM Environment Control:** The attacker has to be able to set environment variables through PAM.

**Additional Details:**
* The upstream fix involves ignoring the PAM environment variables when `UseLogin=yes` is set.
*  The vulnerability is considered "low" or "moderate" risk because the vulnerable configuration (`UseLogin=yes` and user-specific pam environment vars) is not the default setup for OpenSSH.
*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 configurations with `UseLogin=yes` will not function without disabling SELinux or setting it to permissive mode.
*  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the default sshd PAM configuration uses `pam_env` module, but it's only used to read system configuration files, and reading of users' `~/.pam_environment` is not enabled by default.
*  PAM versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier do not support reading of users' environment settings, which means the issue is not exploitable in those versions.
* The Debian Security Advisory DSA-3550 states that the vulnerable configuration is not enabled by default.
* Several vendors, such as NetApp, acknowledged the issue and provided updates for their products.

This vulnerability highlights the risks of using the `UseLogin` option in sshd combined with user-controlled PAM environment variables.
