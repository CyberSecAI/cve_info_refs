Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-8051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the Adobe Premiere Clip iOS mobile application when handling project names. Specifically, the application fails to encode or sanitize user-supplied project names, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of input validation on the project name field. This allows for the injection of script code.
- **Filter Bypass:** The lack of proper input sanitization leads to a bypass of the application's filter and service validation mechanisms.
- **Broken Encoding:** During the sync process with the Adobe Creative Cloud, the project name containing malicious code is not properly encoded.
- **Persistent Vulnerability:**  The malicious code injected is stored in the project and when shared through a mail, it is executed in the mail body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The injected script code can be executed when the project is shared via email, due to the usage of `cid:x` in the email body.
- **Session Hijacking:** Although not detailed, the advisory mentions session hijacking, potentially as a consequence of executing malicious code.
- **Persistent Phishing/Redirects:** The attacker can introduce persistent phishing or malicious redirects that remain within the Adobe environment.
- **Manipulation of Application Modules:** The attacker can manipulate the application API and connected application modules by leveraging the vulnerability in the project name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote (POST request):** An attacker can inject malicious file names via a remote POST request.
- **Local (Sync):** An attacker can inject malicious file names through the sync functionality.
- **Share function**: The vulnerability is triggered when a project containing the malicious code is shared using the mail functionality, because the data is not encoded during the cloud sync process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid Adobe user account with restricted access.
- User interaction is required to sync and share a project via mail.
- The attacker can be a remote user.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the project name value of the Adobe Premiere Clips iOS mobile application.
- The `cid:x` is used to reference a resource, and the vulnerability is in the way the email client handles this reference. In this case, it results in the execution of the injected code within the email body context when the email is opened.
- The attack is persistent, meaning the injected code remains in the project and can be executed multiple times by sharing via mail after each sync.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was initially discovered by the Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team, specifically by Benjamin Kunz Mejri.
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Premiere Clip version 1.1.1 and earlier for iOS.
- Adobe released version 1.2.1 to patch this issue.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 5.2.
