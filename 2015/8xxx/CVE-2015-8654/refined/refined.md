  "CVE-2015-8654": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within MPEG-4 parsing. A specially crafted MP4 file can force Adobe Flash to read memory past the end of an allocated object. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read due to a flaw in MPEG-4 parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
      "Opening a malicious MP4 file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP4 file and host it on a webpage or deliver it to the victim.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs when Adobe Flash reads memory past the end of an allocated object while parsing a specially crafted MP4 file. The vulnerability requires user interaction as the user has to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
