We don't think that one is pending. It was about 744980, covered in the

A patch was suggested by Francois Chagnon, which prevents the errors seen by valgrind on my system and thus might be of use to you. I have attached it as `read-past-buffer.diff`.  Thanks for your time and consideration, -mike ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c1)  Mike Dalessio    2015-03-11 20:16:50 UTC  ``` Possibly also worth noting, for prioritization purposes, is that the original reporter was seeing real unsafe memory access (not simply a use of uninitialized pointers) in a production system.  I suspect there may be a DOS vector here, but couldn't produce on on my local system in a reasonable amount of time. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c2)  Daniel Veillard    2015-03-14 14:39:21 UTC  ``` Hum, I need to look at this thanks for raising this, and the patch :-) !  Daniel ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c3)  Jun Kokatsu    2015-05-11 18:21:18 UTC  ``` Dear All,  I'm founder of this bug.  <https://hackerone.com/reports/57125>  In Shopify, I was able to see previous http request which includes Email address, session_hash, and even last 4 digit of credit card number. I reported this bug on 8th of March and reported to Shopify but I didn't know that it was problem of this. Just FYI.  Thanks,  Jun ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c4)  Daniel Veillard    2015-10-30 11:15:56 UTC  ``` Dohh it seems I dropped the ball ... Looking at it !  Daniel ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c5)  Daniel Veillard    2015-10-30 13:24:45 UTC  ``` I think the fundamental problem is that a lot of the code assumes 0 terminated buffers, the problem is that the HTML parser there forgot to check for the termination when reading the 2 first characters in the comment. As a result I ended up with a rather different patch  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=e724879d964d774df9b7969fc846605aa1bac54c>    thanks for the report and the initial patch, sorry it took so long !  Daniel ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c6)  Mike Dalessio    2015-10-30 20:59:05 UTC  ``` Great, thank you! ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=746048#c7)  Reed Loden    2015-12-31 22:03:31 UTC  ``` This has been assigned CVE-2015-8710 by MITRE. ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 782782 782985 783010 802827 803942 806384

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed
by an application using libxml2, would cause that application to use an
excessive amount of CPU, leak potentially sensitive information, or
crash the application.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.9.3+dfsg1-1 or earlier versions.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.3+dfsg1-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

 HTML comment

(saw this randomly today on Twitter, so figured I'd send it on to make sure
it gets a CVE and actually gets fixed)

<https://hackerone.com/reports/57125#activity-384861>

"""
This is an out-of-bounds memory access in libxml2. By entering a unclosed
html comment such as <!-- the libxml2 parser didn't stop parsing at the end
of the buffer, causing random memory to be included in the parsed comment
that was returned to ruby. In Shopify, this caused ruby objects from
previous http requests to be disclosed in the rendered page.

Link to the issue in libxml2's bugtracker:
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=746048>

A patched version of nokogiri (which uses a embedded libxml2) is available
here:
<https://github.com/Shopify/nokogiri/compare/1b1fcad8bd64ab70256666c38d2c998e86ade8c0...master>

This bug is still not patched upstream, but both libxml2 and nokogiri
developers are aware of the issue.

TTBOMK, this and as well
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/19/5> has a pending
CVE assignment request.

Can you assign CVEs for it, or does both actually do not warrant a CVE
id assignment?

Regards and thanks for all your work,
Salvatore
