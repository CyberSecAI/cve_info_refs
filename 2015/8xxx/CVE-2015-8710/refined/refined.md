Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8710:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in libxml2's HTML parser when parsing an unclosed HTML comment. The parser does not properly check for the end of the buffer when encountering an unclosed comment (e.g., `<!--`), leading it to read beyond the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The parser reads memory beyond the intended buffer, accessing arbitrary memory locations.
- **Uninitialized data:** The vulnerability leads to the usage of uninitialized values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can result in the disclosure of sensitive information from other parts of the application's memory. In one instance, it led to the leakage of previous HTTP requests, including email addresses, session hashes, and credit card details.
- **Denial of Service (potential):** While not directly demonstrated in the provided examples, the possibility of a denial of service (DoS) attack exists due to the incorrect memory access patterns.
- **Application crash:** The usage of uninitialized memory could lead to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted HTML content:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted HTML document containing an unclosed comment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an HTML document to an application which is using a vulnerable version of `libxml2`
