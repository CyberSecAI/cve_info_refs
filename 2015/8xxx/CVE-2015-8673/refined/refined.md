- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Debug account on Huawei TE product has an old password check vulnerability. The system does not verify the old password during password change operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient password change security. Lack of old password verification when changing debug account password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the password of the Debug account without knowing the old password and gain access to the debug account.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to a PC where a user logged in using the Debug account and left the PC unattended.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the computer where the debug account was logged in. The user must have logged into a PC using the debug account before and then left it.
