Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-8403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error in Adobe Flash Player.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Use-after-free vulnerability: This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is still used, leading to unpredictable behavior, including crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system. This means an attacker could gain control of the affected machine.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability could cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information.
*   **Security Restrictions Bypass:** An attacker might be able to bypass security restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, likely by enticing a user to visit a malicious webpage hosting a compromised Flash file.
*   **Unspecified Vectors:** The exact method by which the use-after-free is triggered is not described in detail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a specially crafted Flash file to the victim.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to reach the victim's machine over a network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player versions **before 18.0.0.268** and **19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228** on Windows and OS X and **before 11.2.202.554 on Linux**, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.204, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204.
*   The vulnerability is listed alongside many other CVEs, suggesting that Adobe Flash Player had a number of issues at the time.
*   SUSE rates this issue as "important" with a CVSS v2 base score of 10, which indicates a high severity.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8403 is a serious use-after-free vulnerability that affects Adobe Flash Player. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive information, or bypass security restrictions on a vulnerable system. The attack can be delivered remotely, such as by hosting a malicious SWF file on a website. Users of affected versions of Flash Player are advised to upgrade to the latest versions to mitigate this risk.
