{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `odbc_bindcols` function in `ext/odbc/php_odbc.c` mishandles driver behavior for `SQL_WVARCHAR` columns when using the `odbc_fetch_array` function with certain Microsoft SQL Server tables. This mishandling involves an incorrect size calculation leading to a heap buffer over-read during data retrieval.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer over-read",
      "Improper null termination"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a specific type of Microsoft SQL Server table with SQL_WVARCHAR columns using `odbc_fetch_array` via a PHP application.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a PHP application to execute odbc_fetch_array on a vulnerable database column. No malicious request is needed; a simple access to the vulnerable data triggers the issue. This implies that any user with access to that application can trigger the issue."
