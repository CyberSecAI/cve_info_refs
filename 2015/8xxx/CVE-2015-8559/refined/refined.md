Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `knife bootstrap` command in Chef constructs a shell command that includes the `validator.pem` private key as a here-doc. This command, which contains the private key, is then executed on the target node via `ssh node 'sudo sh -c full-command-goes-here'`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Exposure of Private Key:** The private key is embedded directly within the shell command string.
- **Command Line Logging:** The `sudo sh -c ...` command with the embedded private key is logged in system logs.
- **Potential Log Forwarding:** System logs containing the private key may be forwarded to other systems, possibly in clear text, further increasing exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Loss of Confidentiality:** The primary impact is the exposure of the `validator.pem` private key, which could allow unauthorized access to the Chef infrastructure.
- **Compromise of Chef Infrastructure:** With access to the private key, an attacker could potentially perform actions against the Chef server and managed nodes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **System Log Access:** An attacker who gains access to the system logs (e.g., `/var/log/messages`) on the target node could extract the private key.
- **Log Forwarding Interception:** If the system logs are forwarded to other systems, an attacker could potentially intercept the logs during transmission or access the logs on the destination system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to System Logs:** The attacker needs access to the system logs on the target node where the `knife bootstrap` command was executed or to any system where the logs are forwarded.
- **Privileged Access (Potentially):** While the key is exposed in the logs, it's typically protected by file system permissions on the client. The attacker would not have to have root access on the node being bootstrapped to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs because the `knife bootstrap` command creates a shell command string with the private key as a here-doc and passes it to `sh -c`. This design flaw results in the private key becoming part of the command line and thus, logged.
- The fix involved removing the `sh -c` wrapper around the bootstrapper command, which prevents the private key from being exposed in logs. This is achieved by directly executing the script on the target node, instead of wrapping it in a shell command.
- Issue #3872, also linked from the oss-security mailing list, discusses a race condition related to creating private files during bootstrap, but it is separate from this vulnerability.
