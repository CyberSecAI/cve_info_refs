# [Chef Infra Client 15.4.45 released](/t/chef-infra-client-15-4-45-released/16081)

[Chef Release Announcements](/c/chef-release/9)

[tas50](https://discourse.chef.io/u/tas50)

Hey folks,

We have a great new release of Chef Infra Client 15 out today with 15.4.45. This includes some bootstrap and custom resource improvements along with a pile of updates to core Chef Infra resources.

## converge\_if\_changed Improvements

Chef Infra Client will now take into account any `default` values specified in custom resources when making converge determinations with the `converge_if_changed` helper. Previously, default values would be ignored, which caused necessary changes to be skipped. Note: This change may cause behavior changes for some users, but we believe this original behavior is an impacting bug for enough users to make it outside of a major release. Thanks [@jakauppila](https://github.com/jakauppila) for reporting this.

## Bootstrap Improvements

Several improvements have been made to the `knife bootstrap` command to make it more reliable and secure:

* File creation is now wrapped in a umask to avoid potential race conditions
* `NameError` and `RuntimeError` failures during bootstrap have been resolved
* `Undefined method 'empty?' for nil:NilClass` during bootstrap have been resolved
* Single quotes in attributes during bootstrap no longer result in bootstrap failures
* The bootstrap command no longer appears in PS on the host while bootstrapping is running

## knife supermarket list Improvements

The `knife supermarket list` command now includes two new options:

* `--sort-by [recently_updated recently_added most_downloaded most_followed]`: Sort cookbooks returned from the Supermarket API
* `--owned_by`: Limit returned cookbooks to a particular owner

## Updated Resources

### chocolatey\_package

The `chocolatey_package` resource no longer fails when passing options with the `options` property. Thanks for reporting this issue [@kenmacleod](https://github.com/kenmacleod).

### kernel\_module

The `kernel_module` resource includes a new `options` property, which allows users to set module specific parameters and settings. Thanks [@ramereth](https://github.com/ramereth) for this new feature.

Example of a kernel\_module resource using the new options property:

```
  kernel_module 'loop' do
  options [ 'max_loop=4', 'max_part=8' ]
  end

```
### remote\_file

The `remote_file` resource has been updated to better display progress when using the `show_progress` resource. Thanks for reporting this issue [@isuftin](https://github.com/isuftin).

### sudo

The `sudo` resource now runs sudo config validation against all of the sudo configuration files on the system instead of only the file being written. This allows us to detect configuration errors that occur when configs conflict with each other. Thanks for reporting this issue [@drzewiec](https://github.com/drzewiec).

### windows\_ad\_join

The `windows_ad_join` has a new `:leave` action for leaving an Active Directory domain and rejoining a workgroup. This new action also has a new `workgroup_name` property for specifying the workgroup to join upon leaving the domain. Thanks [@jasonwbarnett](https://github.com/jasonwbarnett) for adding this new action.

Example of leaving a domain

```
windows_ad_join 'Leave the domain' do
  workgroup_name 'local'
  action :leave
end

```
### windows\_package

The `windows_package` resource no longer updates environmental variables before installing the package. This prevents potential modifications that may cause a package installation to fail. Thanks [@jeremyhage](https://github.com/jeremyhage) for this fix.

### windows\_service

The `windows_service` resource no longer updates the service and triggers notifications if the case of the `run_as_user` property does not match the user set on the service. Thanks [@jasonwbarnett](https://github.com/jasonwbarnett) for this fix.

### windows\_share

The `windows_share` resource is now fully idempotent by better validating the provided `path` property from the user. Thanks [@Happycoil](https://github.com/Happycoil) for this fix.

## Security Updates

### Ruby

Ruby has been updated from 2.6.4 to 2.6.5 in order to resolve the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2019-16255](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16255): A code injection vulnerability of Shell# and Shell#test
* [CVE-2019-16254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16254): HTTP response splitting in WEBrick (Additional fix)
* [CVE-2019-15845](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15845): A NUL injection vulnerability of File.fnmatch and File.fnmatch?
* [CVE-2019-16201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16201): Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability of WEBrick’s Digest access authentication

# Get the Build

As always, you can download binaries directly from [downloads.chef.io](https://downloads.chef.io/chef/15.4.45)  or by using the `mixlib-install` command line utility:

```
$ mixlib-install download chef -v 15.4.45

```

Alternatively, you can install Chef Infra Client using one of the following command options:

```
# In Shell
$ curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P chef -v 15.4.45

# In Windows Powershell
. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project chef -version 15.4.45

```

If you want to give this version a spin in Test Kitchen, create or add the following to your `kitchen.yml` file:

```
provisioner:
  product_name: chef
  product_version: 15.4.45

```

Enjoy,

Tim

Subject: Re: Chef: knife bootstrap leaks validator privkey into system logs

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> <https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/3871>

Use CVE-2015-8559 for the originally described issue in 3871. The
"sudo command logging on most reasonable systems, in the system logs.
The logs may also be forwarded to other places (possibly in clear
text)" scenario, at least, seems relevant.

In general, an issue with unlogged private data on a command line
sometimes does not have a CVE ID, if the command line only occurs
during initial installation of a machine, before any unprivileged user
accounts would have access. (We don't know enough about the use cases
to determine whether that sometimes applies to chef.)

> I can't recall but I suspect this is also a problem with the
> validatorless bootstrapping as well, which copies client.pem up to the
> node instead validation.pem.

We aren't assigning a CVE ID for a "can't recall but I suspect this is
also a problem" report. If there is a second vulnerability disclosed by
lamont-granquist, then there should be a second CVE ID.

> <https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/3872>

> creates private files via here-doc cat(1)ing followed by running

>
> This is a race condition if the default umask creates files world- or

3872 was linked from 3871. If there is a race-condition vulnerability
disclosed in 3872, we may be able to assign a CVE ID. (We would not
want a CVE if the issue can occur only before unprivileged user
accounts would have access.)

# CVE-2015-8559: knife bootstrap leaks validator.pem private key into system logs #3871

## Description

[![@jschauma](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421543?u=5fe3bd7e6f940cc39fe0697959806054063f726f&v=4&size=48)](/jschauma)[jschauma](https://github.com/jschauma)opened [on Sep 3, 2015](https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/3871#issue-104792957)

When you 'knife bootstrap' a node, the validator.pem private RSA key is leaked into the system logs /var/log/messages.

The reason is that 'knife bootstrap' constructs a shell command to run on the node from a template, filling the private key in as a here-doc (see

[chef/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/templates/chef-full.erb](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/81419cc617091461b8a78c93276e00a7276484df/lib/chef/knife/bootstrap/templates/chef-full.erb#L193)

Line 193
in
[81419cc](/chef/chef/commit/81419cc617091461b8a78c93276e00a7276484df)

|  | <%= validation\_key %> |
| --- | --- |

). This command is invoked via (more or less):

ssh node 'sudo sh -c full-command-goes-here'

As a result, the private key ends up on the command-line, in the process table, and, by way of sudo command logging on most reasonable systems, in the system logs. The logs may also be forwarded to other places (possibly in clear text), and possible stored on other systems, making the private validator key not quite so private any more.

| I think this is a breaking change and that we should still support the validation key [@marcparadise](https://github.com/marcparadise) ?  The issue is that we should remove the `sh -c` since I think we now ship the script over scp and don't execute it entirely over ssh? And that way we keep all of the contents of the file off of the ps listing, which this change wouldn't accomplish. |
