Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-based out-of-bounds read in the `AirPDcapDecryptWPABroadcastKey` function within Wireshark's 802.11 dissector. This occurs during the decryption of 802.11 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious network packets:** An attacker can inject a malformed 802.11 packet onto the network.
- **Malicious packet trace files:** An attacker can create a malformed packet trace file and convince a user to open it in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to inject network packets or convince a user to open a malicious packet trace file.
- No specific user privileges are required for exploitation other than running Wireshark and using it to open a malformed capture file or capture the malicious network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
* This issue is related to, but distinct from, a separate stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the AirPDcapPacketProcess function (mentioned in the provided content as bug 11790).
* The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 2.0.0, and 1.12.0 to 1.12.8, and fixed in versions 2.0.1 and 1.12.9.
