Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-8785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `fuse_fill_write_pages` function within the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation. Specifically, if a user provides a `writev` system call with a zero-length segment as the first segment of an iov (scatter-gather array), the `fuse_fill_write_pages` function enters an infinite loop because the `iov_iter_advance()` function is never reached within the loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The primary weakness is the potential for an infinite loop in the kernel function. This loop prevents the process from terminating, consuming CPU resources and causing a denial of service.
*  **Use-After-Free:** A similar problem is described regarding iov\_iter\_copy\_from\_user\_atomic and iov\_iter\_fault\_in\_readable. When a zero-length segment was followed by a segment with an invalid address, then only the zero-length segment is checked, the iov\_iter\_copy\_from\_user\_atomic() skips over it, fails at the next segment and the process goes to an infinite loop without the advance on the zero-length segment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The most significant impact is a denial of service. The affected process becomes unkillable, consuming CPU resources and potentially requiring a system reboot. The process cannot be terminated and requires a reboot.
*   **System Unresponsiveness:** The tight loop prevents the process from making any forward progress, rendering it unresponsive and wasting CPU time.
*  **Privilege Escalation** In cases where the zero-length is followed by a segment with an invalid address, it can be used to bypass checks and trigger a use-after-free condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring a user to execute a specially crafted `writev` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute system calls.
*   **Ability to perform syscalls:** The attacker needs to be able to make the `sys_writev` syscall and have access to the filesystem and execute a specially crafted sequence of iov structs.

**Additional Information:**
* This issue is resolved by calling `iov_iter_advance()` before repeating the loop to copy data from user space.

**Affected Components**
* fuse\_fill\_write\_pages() function in Linux kernel, specifically, the implementation in `fs/fuse/file.c`.
* Linux kernel versions prior to 4.4 (where it was fixed) are affected.

**Affected Distributions/Products**

The vulnerability affected multiple Linux distributions and products that included the vulnerable kernel version, including:

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time Extension 12 SP1
*   openSUSE Leap 15.3
*   Ubuntu 12.04
*   Various other SUSE Linux Enterprise products.

**Fix Information**

The vulnerability was addressed by a fix in the Linux kernel mainline, introduced in commit `3ca8138f014a913f98e6ef40e939868e1e9ea876` (which is also referenced in the content). The fix ensures that `iov_iter_advance()` is called before repeating an attempt to copy data from userspace which avoids the infinite loop.
