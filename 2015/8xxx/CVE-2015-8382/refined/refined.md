Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `pcre_exec` function within the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library. Specifically, when processing an invalid regular expression, `pcre_exec` partially initializes a buffer. This partial initialization leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Buffer:** The core issue is that a buffer used by `pcre_exec` isn't fully initialized in certain error conditions related to invalid regex input. This results in the potential disclosure of uninitialized memory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the uninitialized buffer, an attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information residing in the memory that was not properly initialized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of potentially sensitive data from the process's memory. The disclosed memory could contain a variety of information depending on the context where the vulnerable code is being used, which is a problem especially when PCRE is used in web browsers.
*  The Red Hat bug report indicates that a patch was already applied to PHP 5.4+ as a mitigation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing an invalid regular expression to the `pcre_exec` function. This vulnerability can be triggered without malicious user input.
*  The vulnerability was initially reported by ZDI (ZDI-CAN-2547).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to cause a call to the vulnerable `pcre_exec` function with an invalid regex that triggers the partial initialization condition.
*   No specific privilege level is mentioned, which suggests that any user able to invoke a program that uses PCRE to evaluate regular expressions may potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this issue is part of PCRE release 8.37, according to Red Hat's report.
*  The Red Hat bug report also notes that the vulnerability is related to bad regex code, but it does not require malicious user-input to trigger.
* This vulnerability is related to a bug in the PCRE library itself and not a 'regex injection' vulnerability in an application that uses PCRE.

In summary, CVE-2015-8382 describes an information disclosure vulnerability due to the partial initialization of a buffer in PCRE's `pcre_exec` function when processing invalid regular expressions. This could allow an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from uninitialized memory regions.
