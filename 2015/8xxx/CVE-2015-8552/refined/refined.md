{
  "CVE-2015-8552": {
    "description": "The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to generate a continuous stream of WARN messages and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi operations, aka \"Linux pciback missing sanity checks.\"",
    "vulnerability": "The Xen PCI backend driver does not adequately validate the device state when a guest configures MSIs.",
    "impact": "A local guest administrator can cause a denial of service (crash or disk space exhaustion) on the host.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access by guest administrator to a system with passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a guest administrator with the ability to manipulate the passed-through PCI device and perform XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi operations. The attacker must be able to configure MSIs from the guest kernel.",
    "root_cause": "Missing sanity checks in the Xen PCI backend driver when handling MSI configurations by a guest."
