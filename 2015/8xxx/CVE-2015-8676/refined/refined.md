- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper memory release for specific types of ICMPv6 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to incorrect handling of ICMPv6 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) leading to device restart due to memory exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted ICMPv6 packets to the vulnerable device over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable Huawei switch resides.
