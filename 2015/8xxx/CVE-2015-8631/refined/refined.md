Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8631:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `krb5_unparse_name()` function within the kadmind service of MIT Kerberos. Specifically, if this function fails while processing a Kerberos request, the client and server names allocated will not be released, causing a memory leak. Additionally, there's a memory leak in the `rename_principal_2_svc()` function if unparsing the second principal name fails, leading to a leak of the first one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak that occurs when the `krb5_unparse_name()` or `rename_principal_2_svc()` functions fail to deallocate allocated memory.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The kadmind service does not properly validate the principal name input in requests. Supplying a null principal name can trigger the memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly send specially crafted requests with null principal names, causing kadmind to consume increasing amounts of memory. This leads to memory exhaustion and eventually results in a denial of service.
*   **System instability**: The constant memory allocation without deallocation can make the system unstable and potentially crash.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability over the network by sending specially crafted requests to the kadmind service.
*   **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to send the malicious requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication**: The attacker must be a legitimate user authenticated to the Kerberos realm.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate over the network with the kadmind service.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Simo Sorce of Red Hat.
*   The issue is present in MIT krb5 versions prior to 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by repeatedly sending requests with null principal names.
*   Patches were backported to older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
