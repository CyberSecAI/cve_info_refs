The provided content is related to CVE-2015-7869, not CVE-2015-8328. Therefore, I will analyze this content based on CVE-2015-7869.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized user mode input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the NVIDIA driver. This could allow malicious actors to manipulate the driver via user-mode interfaces, potentially leading to various issues.

**Impact of exploitation:** The provided text does not specify the exact impact of the unsanitized input vulnerability. However, it implies a potential for unauthorized actions within the system. Exploitation could range from crashing the driver to possibly achieving arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges, but this is not explicitly stated. The impact is dependent on the nature of the unsanitized input and how it is processed by the driver.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-mode input. This suggests that an attacker would need to be able to influence or send crafted input to the NVIDIA driver through its exposed user-mode interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with the driver at the user-mode level. This could involve a malicious application running on the same system as the vulnerable driver, or potentially by leveraging other vulnerabilities to gain the ability to send malicious input.
