{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sys_oabi_fcntl64` function in the ARM architecture compatibility layer incorrectly handles the F_OFD_GETLK, F_OFD_SETLK, and F_OFD_SETLKW commands, failing to properly translate the 32-bit `flock` structure to a 64-bit version.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of file locking commands",
       "Incorrect translation of data structures between 32-bit and 64-bit interfaces"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel by exploiting this flaw in the `fcntl64` system call.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local malicious application could use a specially crafted `fcntl` command to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to execute code locally on the target system."
  },
  "patch": {
   "description": "The patch introduces a new `do_locks` helper function to handle F_OFD_* and F_*LK64 commands. It performs proper memory copy from user space to kernel space, uses `sys_fcntl64` syscall to execute the command, and copies data back to user space if needed, with proper `set_fs` to avoid kernel access to the user-space addresses",
   "changes": [
        "Introduces a helper function `do_locks` to handle F_OFD_* and F_*LK64 commands.",
        "Properly copies `flock` structure from user space to kernel space.",
        "Invokes the 64-bit `sys_fcntl64` with the translated data.",
        "Copies the result back to user space if the command is a `GETLK` variant.",
        "Uses `set_fs(KERNEL_DS)` before the call to `sys_fcntl64` and `set_fs` back to the user space after, to allow for accessing user space memory safely"
      ]
    }
