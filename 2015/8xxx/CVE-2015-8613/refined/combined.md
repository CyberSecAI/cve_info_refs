# QEMU: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201604-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in QEMU, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution, or cause a Denial of Service
condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/qemu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.0-r2** |

### Background

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in QEMU. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Local users within a guest QEMU environment can execute arbitrary code
within the host or a cause a Denial of Service condition of the QEMU
guest process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All QEMU users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/qemu-2.5.0-r2"

```

    issue that could result in denial-of-service (via application
    crash).

CVE-2015-8743

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.

   result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2015-8745

   The vmxnet3 driver incorrectly processes Interrupt Mask Registers,
   which could result in denial-of-service (via application crash).

CVE-2016-1568

    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1714

    Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2016-1922

    Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that

## [Qemu-devel] [PATCH] scsi: initialise info object with appropriate size

  Hello,

```
A stack overflow issue was reported by Mr Qinghao Tang, CC'd here. It occurs
while processing the SCSI controller's CTRL\_GET\_INFO command, as the memset(2)
call uses driver supplied 'cmd->iov\_size' to initialise the '&info' object.
```

Please see below a proposed patch to fix this issue. Does it look okay?

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: initialise info object with appropriate size

While processing controller 'CTRL_GET_INFO' command, the routine
'megasas_ctrl_get_info' overflows the '&info' object size. Use its
appropriate size to null initialise it.

Use CVE-2015-8613.

This is not yet available at
<http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=history;f=hw/scsi/megasas.c> but that
may be an expected place for a later update.
