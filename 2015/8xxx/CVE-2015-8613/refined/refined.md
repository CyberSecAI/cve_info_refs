Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8613:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `megasas_ctrl_get_info` function within the QEMU emulator's SCSI MegaRAID SAS HBA emulation support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The `memset` function within `megasas_ctrl_get_info` uses a driver-supplied `cmd->iov_size` to initialize the `info` object. This size can be larger than the actual size of the `info` object leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be a privileged user within a guest QEMU environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A privileged user inside a QEMU guest virtual machine is needed to trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted SCSI command (`CTRL_GET_INFO`) to the emulated controller.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered while processing the SCSI controller's `CTRL_GET_INFO` command.
- The fix involves initializing the `info` object with its appropriate size (`dcmd_size`) instead of the potentially larger `cmd->iov_size`.
- The vulnerability was reported by Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc.
- Red Hat has rated the vulnerability as having a low security impact and not planned to be addressed in future updates for certain products. However, it has been fixed in later versions of qemu and related packages in Fedora.
