Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8627:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the MediaWiki software's incorrect parsing of IPv4 addresses, specifically those containing leading zeros in their octets (e.g., `141.000.11.253`). The `IP::toHex` function, used for converting IP addresses to a hexadecimal representation, was failing to process these IPs correctly. This was due to a regular expression that was not correctly removing all leading zeros.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect IP Normalization:**  The `IP::sanitizeIP()` function was not correctly normalizing IPv4 addresses with leading zeros in their octets. Specifically, it failed to handle double or triple zeros. This resulted in the software not recognizing the IP as the intended address.
- **Bypass of IP Blocking:**  Due to the improper parsing, a user could specify an IP address with leading zeros in an attempt to block a specific address. The software would not register the block correctly and therefore the intended IP address would not be blocked. This bypass is the core of the security problem.
- **Potential for Wide-Range Blocking:** A malicious, partially-privileged user could use this flaw to intentionally block a broader range of legitimate user activity by using extra zeros. This would make it appear as though a single IP address was blocked in logs, when in fact, many addresses might be affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Failed IP Blocks:**  IP addresses with zero-padded octets could bypass intended IP blocking rules. This allowed malicious users to potentially circumvent security measures and continue their actions.
-   **Circumvention of Global Blocks:** As indicated by the reporter, the incorrect parsing could impact global blocks, potentially impacting newly registered users.
- **Misleading Logs:** The issue could lead to misleading log entries, making it difficult for administrators to track and manage blocked users. The logs might only show the improperly formatted IP, not the actual IPs being impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Direct Input:** Attackers could directly input malicious IP addresses with leading zeros into blocking forms or APIs.
-   **Trusted Proxies:** If a trusted proxy adds an IP with leading zeros, the intended user might not be blocked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Partially Privileged User:** The attacker needed to have sufficient privileges to create IP blocks. This is implied by the description of "partially privileged users" being able to initiate blocks.
-   **Knowledge of IP Parsing Vulnerability:** The attacker needed to know about the software's incorrect parsing of IP addresses with leading zeros.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix involved correcting the regular expression used in `IP::sanitizeIP()` to remove leading zeros from IPv4 octets. The patch also addressed a regression introduced by an earlier fix, which caused issues with usernames and login.
-   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `IP::sanitizeIP()` function to remove leading zeros from IPv4 addresses. Additionally, the change was restricted to only apply to strings that are valid IPv4 addresses to prevent issues with username handling.
-   The issue was initially reported by a Wikimedia steward who mistakenly gave an IP in the form of `X.000.X.X` to a bot, which had unexpected consequences.
-  The fix for this vulnerability was included in MediaWiki versions 1.26.1, 1.25.4, 1.24.5 and 1.23.12.
