Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2015-8994:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Zend OPCache generates keys for cached PHP scripts. By default, it uses the file path as a primary component of the cache key.
*   In shared hosting environments, where multiple users might have similar file paths within their respective chroot or user directories (e.g., `/wp-config.php`), this leads to cache key collisions.
*   Additionally, all PHP processes, including those with different user IDs, share the same OPCache, which is initialized by a parent process. This allows one user to potentially access another user's cached scripts, bypassing file system permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Cache Key Generation:** The use of simple file paths as cache keys without considering user context or file metadata creates a vulnerability in shared hosting setups.
*   **Shared Memory Cache:** The shared memory design of OPCache, where all PHP processes inherit the same cache, means that file system permissions can be bypassed.
*   **Bypassing File Permissions:** Due to the above, users can access and execute cached scripts of other users even if they do not have direct file system access.
*   **Bypassing `open_basedir`:**  The vulnerability circumvents the `open_basedir` restriction. Even if a user is restricted by `open_basedir`, they can still access and run cached scripts that are outside of their allowed paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-User Code Execution:** One user can execute code from another user's cached scripts. This is particularly problematic for CMS applications where `wp-config.php` or similar configuration files are often cached, potentially revealing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information stored in PHP scripts, such as database credentials, API keys, and other configuration details.
*   **Compromise of Web Applications:** Attackers can leverage this to compromise web applications hosted on the server, potentially gaining full access to the database and control over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Cached Scripts:** The attacker needs to know or guess the file path of a PHP script they want to execute which may be simplified by the use of `opcache_get_status()` to enumerate the cache.
*   **Exploiting Shared Memory:** An attacker leverages the shared OPCache to run the compiled bytecode regardless of file permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Shared Hosting Environment:** The attacker needs to be in a shared hosting environment where multiple users have PHP applications running and where OPCache is enabled.
*   **Basic Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs some knowledge of file paths to target specific scripts.
*   **Ability to Execute PHP Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on the server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   **`opcache.validate_permission=1`:** PHP introduced an option to validate file access permissions before executing cached code, which mitigates the issue, however, is not enabled by default
*   **`opcache.validate_root=1`**: PHP introduced the option to add the root inode number to the key, to help resolve collisions.
*  **Separate FPM Master Processes:** Using separate FPM master processes for each site, will allow each site to have its own OPCache instance. However, this can be cumbersome and is not default.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability affects PHP 5.x and 7.x prior to specific versions unless the mitigation settings are used.
*  The issue is more severe when running multiple sites under the same user and not using chroot environments, but can still impact systems even with a chroot environment.
*  The lack of proper documentation and the default behavior of OPCache led to many shared hosting providers being vulnerable.
*   A patch was released which addressed the vulnerability by validating file permissions and modifying cache key generation, but the validation of permissions is not enabled by default.
