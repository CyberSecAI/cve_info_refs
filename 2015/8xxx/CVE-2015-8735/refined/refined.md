Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8735:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the Bluetooth Attribute (BT ATT) dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed packet can trigger a crash in the `memcpy` function during the `get_value / dissect_btatt` process, leading to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the BT ATT dissector processes malformed packets, leading to a `memcpy` operation that attempts to write to an invalid memory location.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The dissector does not properly validate or sanitize the input data, allowing a malformed packet to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the Wireshark application. This can disrupt network analysis activities and prevent the tool from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a crafted, malformed Bluetooth packet onto the network that Wireshark is monitoring.
*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can provide a malformed packet trace file (.cap) to a user, which, when opened with Wireshark, will trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject crafted Bluetooth packets into the network being monitored.
*   **File Delivery/Social Engineering:** Alternatively, the attacker could send a malicious capture file to a user.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any prior authentication.

**Affected Versions:** Wireshark version 2.0.0 is affected.

**Fixed Versions:** Wireshark versions 2.0.1 and later are not affected.
