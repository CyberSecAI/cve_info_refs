Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Dotclear 2.8.1 handles the comment author's name when displaying the list of comments. Specifically, the author's name is echoed within the `value` attribute of a hidden input tag without proper encoding of quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Because quotes are not encoded, an attacker can inject additional HTML attributes into the input tag. While the input field is hidden and name length is limited, older browsers might be susceptible to style injection, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Although the vulnerability is considered low severity due to limitations, a successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to execute malicious code within the user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Comment Author Name:** An attacker can create a comment with a crafted author name containing malicious HTML attributes.
- **Visiting Comments Page:** When an administrator views the comments list associated with the attacker's crafted author name, the malicious code embedded in the author's name gets executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Post Comments:** An attacker needs to be able to post comments on a Dotclear blog.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerability in the comment management page.
- **Admin Access to Comments:** The attacker requires an admin to visit the specific vulnerable comments page to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dotclear 2.8.1 and was fixed in version 2.8.2.
- The fix involves HTML-escaping the author name before inserting it into the input tag's value attribute.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity due to the hidden field and character length restrictions, making exploitation challenging, but not impossible, especially with older browsers.
