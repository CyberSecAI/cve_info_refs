| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1278965#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-11-06 21:47:05 UTC  ``` It was found that getnum() function in lua_struct.c is vulnerable to integer overflow that can be used to trigger stack-based buffer overflow. getnum() can be tricked into an integer wraparound with a large size number as input, thus returning a negative value. Affected versions of redis are 2.8 and 3.0.  Vulnerable code:  static int getnum (const char **fmt, int df) {   if (!isdigit(**fmt))  /* no number? */     return df;  /* return default value */   else {     int a = 0;     do {       a = a*10 + *((*fmt)++) - '0';     } while (isdigit(**fmt));     return a;   } }  static size_t optsize (lua_State *L, char opt, const char **fmt) {   switch (opt) { [...]     case 'c': return getnum(fmt, 1);     case 'i': case 'I': {       int sz = getnum(fmt, sizeof(int));       if (sz > MAXINTSIZE)         luaL_error(L, "integral size %d is larger than limit of %d",                        sz, MAXINTSIZE);       return sz;     }     default: return 0;  /* other cases do not need alignment */   } }  Upstream bug report (including reproducer):  <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2855>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/231>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1278965#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-11-06 21:47:48 UTC  ```  Created redis tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1278966](show_bug.cgi?id=1278966 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2015-8080 redis: Integer wraparound in lua_struct.c causing stack-based buffer overflow [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1278967](show_bug.cgi?id=1278967 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-8080 redis: Integer wraparound in lua_struct.c causing stack-based buffer overflow [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1278965#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-02-01 21:04:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 7.0 Operational Tools for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:0097 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0097.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1278965#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-02-01 21:04:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 7 For RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:0096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0096.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1278965#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-02-01 21:05:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenStack 6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2016:0095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0095.html>   ``` |  |

# CVE-2015-8080

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-8079.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-8104.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-8080 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8080)

#### Description

Integer overflow in the getnum function in lua\_struct.c in Redis 2.8.x before 2.8.24 and 3.0.x before 3.0.6 allows context-dependent attackers with permission to run Lua code in a Redis session to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a large number, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.

## Topic

Updated redis packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, or
sorted sets.

An integer-wraparound flaw leading to a stack-based overflow was found in
Redis. A user with access to run Lua code in a Redis session could possibly
use this flaw to crash the server (denial of service) or gain code
execution outside of the Lua sandbox. (CVE-2015-8080)

All users of redis are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Redis: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201702-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Redis, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/redis** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.5**>= **3.0.7** |

### Background

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store,
used as a database, cache and message broker.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Redis. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, able to connect to a Redis instance, could issue
malicious commands possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Redis 3.0.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-3.0.7"

```

All Redis 3.2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/redis-3.2.5"

```

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Description

[![@lucab](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98086?u=a71b6a6002d687d995ac92f3d0ba43ab46c7dd76&v=4&size=48)](/lucab)[lucab](https://github.com/lucab)opened [on Nov 5, 2015](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/2855#issue-115403423)

[re-posting via github after private reporting, as agreed with antirez]

Embedded copy of lua\_struct.c suffers of an integer overflow in the `getnum()` parser that can be used to trigger (at least) a stack-based buffer overflow.

This affects all released versions of redis in both 2.8 and 3.0 branches.

The following code is part of `lua_struct.c`

```
static int getnum (const char **fmt, int df) {
  if (!isdigit(**fmt))  /* no number? */
    return df;  /* return default value */
  else {
    int a = 0;
    do {
      a = a*10 + *((*fmt)++) - '0';
    } while (isdigit(**fmt));
    return a;
  }
}

static size_t optsize (lua_State *L, char opt, const char **fmt) {
  switch (opt) {
[...]
    case 'c': return getnum(fmt, 1);
    case 'i': case 'I': {
      int sz = getnum(fmt, sizeof(int));
      if (sz > MAXINTSIZE)
        luaL_error(L, "integral size %d is larger than limit of %d",
                       sz, MAXINTSIZE);
      return sz;
    }
    default: return 0;  /* other cases do not need alignment */
  }
}
```

`getnum()` can be tricked into an integer wraparound with a large size number as input, thus returning a negative value.

`optsize()` has no lower bound/negative check; moreover, there is an implicit `int` -> `size_t` promotion, yielding a very large (unsigned) size value.

This, plus further `int`/`size_t` confusion in the whole module, results in stack-based buffer overflows in other places,

eg. `putinteger()` reachable in LUA via `struct.pack()`.

Simple PoC as follow:

```
  EVAL "struct.pack('>I2147483648', '10')" 0

```

Where:

* '2147483648' is a user-controlled index, larger than `MAX_INT32`, fooling `optsize()`
* '>I' is there to reach a buffer overflow in `putinteger()`
* '10' is a user-controlled input stored into `value`

This will result in memory corruption due a user-controlled write outside of a (stack-based) array. Running the PoC above, this can be observed from gdb:

```
171 char buff[32];
...
185         for (i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
186           buff[i] = (value & 0xff);
(gdb) print i
$3 = 2147483647

```

As far as we can tell, 2854 and 2853 do not need to be categorized as
vulnerability reports, but 2855 is a report of at least one
vulnerability. See the initial CVE ID assignment below.

> <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2854>

> the whole "strict lua" in scriptingEnableGlobalsProtection() can be
> bypassed with a simple setmetatable(_G, nil)

We are not currently planning to assign any CVE IDs for cases in which
a security-relevant impact has a requirement of malicious lines of
code in a script. For example, <http://antirez.com/news/96> says 'The
Redis security model is: "it's totally insecure to let untrusted
clients access the system, please protect it from the outside world
yourself".' More specifically,
<https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/1725#issuecomment-42382547>
says 'the Redis documentation recognizes this flaw and says "Using Lua
debugging functionality or other approaches like altering the meta
table used to implement global protections in order to circumvent
globals protection is not hard. However it is difficult to do it
accidentally. If the user messes with the Lua global state, the
consistency of AOF and replication is not guaranteed: don't do it."
Redis is just trying to stop people from accidentally screwing
themselves, not intentionally doing so.' Our feeling is that the
sandboxing is not (yet) intended to define a security boundary with
any practical value, and thus ability to defeat the sandboxing will
not have a CVE ID at present.

> <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2853>

> it is possible to de-synchronize redis dict and LUA global environment
> via maliciously crafted scripts.

> In fact, a simple PoC can be constructed with two identical EVAL
> commands:

> $ echo 'setfenv(0,{})' > /tmp/redis-crash.lua
> $ redis-cli --eval /tmp/redis-crash.lua
> (nil)
> $ redis-cli --eval /tmp/redis-crash.lua
> Error: Server closed the connection

Similarly, we are not currently planning to assign any CVE IDs for
cases in which a security-relevant impact has a requirement of lines
of code that, although not inherently malicious, are crafted to
trigger a bug.

> <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2855>

We feel that this is an entirely different situation because the
attack can realistically originate from someone who cannot control any
aspect of the code, but can control data that happens to be used by
the code. For example, suppose that a legitimate user has written a
script that satisfies the above "not intentionally ... screwing
themselves" principle, and the script has been tested (although not
comprehensively) and seems to be reliable for an intended, normal type
of functionality. The attacker's role is to insert the number
2147483648 into a data set on which the script operates, and trigger a
crash. We feel that this can have at least one CVE ID.

Use CVE-2015-8080 for the "getnum ... integer wraparound ... thus
returning a negative value" vulnerability.

2855 also says "optsize() has no lower bound/negative check." If this
is an independently exploitable problem, then it can have its own CVE
ID. We think it's conceivable that that bounds check isn't necessarily
required after getnum has been fixed, so we haven't yet assigned a
unique CVE ID. In addition, 2855 also says "optsize() ... an implicit
int -> size_t promotion, yielding a very large (unsigned) size value."
Again, we think it's conceivable that that becomes largely irrelevant
after getnum has been fixed, so we haven't yet assigned a unique CVE
ID. Similarly, "further int/size_t confusion in the whole module"
might be exploitable only with a problematic getnum, and there isn't
any additional CVE ID for any aspect of that set of issues.

Finally,
<https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3rby8c/a_few_things_about_redis_security/>
mentions "especially since the vulnerabilities you reported could
crash the server just because Lua scripts that happened to be just
bugged and not malicious." We don't see any reasonable way to use that
statement as a basis for CVE assignments, i.e., the server is intended
to be robust in the face of all script coding errors but not robust in
the face of script coding manipulations. Even if the vendor wanted a
CVE ID for each case where a script coding error caused a crash, we
would be very reluctant to do that. Instead, as mentioned above, our
preference is to have a CVE ID only in the case of an attack with
crafted data, where that data realistically has a different origin
than the code.

Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8080
Debian Bug     : 804419

Luca Bruno discovered an integer overflow flaw leading to a stack-based
buffer overflow in redis, a persistent key-value database. A remote
attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service (application
crash).

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u3.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:3.0.5-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.0.5-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0096)

## Topic

Updated redis packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, or
sorted sets.

An integer-wraparound flaw leading to a stack-based overflow was found in
Redis. A user with access to run Lua code in a Redis session could possibly
use this flaw to crash the server (denial of service) or gain code
execution outside of the Lua sandbox. (CVE-2015-8080)

All users of redis are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Moderate: redis security advisory

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A0097)

## Topic

Updated redis packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 Operational Tools.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server because keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, or
sorted sets.

An integer-wraparound flaw leading to a stack-based overflow was found in
Redis. A user with access to run Lua code in a Redis session could possibly
use this flaw to crash the server (denial of service) or gain code
execution outside of the Lua sandbox. (CVE-2015-8080)

All users of redis are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Redis 2.8 release notes
=======================
\*\* IMPORTANT \*\* Check the 'Migrating from 2.6 to 2.8' section at the end of
this file for information about what changed between 2.6 and
2.8 and how this may affect your application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:
LOW: No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH: There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--[ Redis 2.8.24 ] Release date: 18 Dec 2015
Upgrade urgency: MODERATE. We fixed a crash that happens very rarely, so
updating does not hurt, but most users are unlikely to
experience this condition because it requires some odd
timing.
\* [FIX] lua\_struct.c/getnum security issue fixed. (Luca Bruno discovered it,
patched by Sun He and Chris Lamb)
\* [FIX] Fix a race condition in processCommand() because of interactions
with freeMemoryIfNeeded(). Details in issue #2948 and especially
in the commit message d999f5a. (Race found analytically by
Oran Agra, patch by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Log offending memory access address on SIGSEGV/SIGBUS (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 2.8.23 ] Release date: 15 Oct 2015
Upgrade urgency: MODERATE, the most important thing is a fix in the replication
code that may make the slave hanging forever if the master
remains with an open socket even if it is no longer able to
reply.
\* [FIX] MOVE now moves the TTL as well. A bug lasting forever... finally
fixed thanks to Andy Grunwald that reported it.
(reported by Andy Grunwald, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fix a false positive in HSTRLEN test.
\* [FIX] Fix a bug in redis-cli --pipe mode that was not able to read back
replies from the server incrementally. Now a mass import will use
a lot less memory, and you can use --pipe to do incremental streaming.
(reported by Twitter user @fsaintjacques, fixed by Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Slave detection of master timeout. (fixed by Kevin McGehee, refactoring
and regression test by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 2.8.22 ] Release date: 8 Sep 2015
Upgrade urgency: HIGH for Redis and Sentinel. However note that in order to
fix certain replication bugs, the replication internals were
modified in a very heavy way. So while this release is
conceptually saner, it may contain regressions. For this
reason, before the release, QA activities were performed by
me (antirez) and Redis Labs and no evident bug was found.
\* [FIX] A number of bugs related to replication PSYNC and the (yet experimental)
diskless replication feature were fixed. The bugs could lead to
inconsistency between masters and slaves. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran
Agra fixed the issue found by Yuval Inbar)
\* [FIX] A replication bug in the context of PSYNC partial resynchonization was
found and fixed. This bug happens even when diskless replication is off
in the case different slaves connect at different times while the master
is creating an RDB file, and later a partial resynchronization is
attempted by a slave that connected not as the first one. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)
\* [FIX] Chained replication and PSYNC interactions leading to potential stale
chained slaves data set, see issue #2694. (Salvatore Sanfilippo fixed
an issue reported by "GeorgeBJ" user at Github)
\* [FIX] redis-cli --scan iteration fixed when returned cursor overflows
32 bit signed integer. (Ofir Luzon, Yuval Inbar)
\* [FIX] Sentinel: fixed a bug during the master switch process, where for a
failed conditional check, the new configuration is rewritten, during
a small window of time, in a corrupted way where the master is
also reported to be one of the slaves. This bug is rare to trigger
but apparently it happens in the wild, and the effect is to see
a replication loop where the master will try to replicate with itself.
A detailed explanation of the bug and its effects can be found in
the commit message here: https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/c20218eb5770b2cafb12bc7092313b8358fedc0a.
The bug was found by Jan-Erik Rediger using a static analyzer and
fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo.
\* [FIX] Sentinel lack of arity checks for certain commands.
(Rogerio Goncalves, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Replication internals rewritten in order to be more resistant to bugs.
The replication handshake in the slave side was rewritten as a non
blocking state machine. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)

from the master to the slave what are the features supported, so that
the master can choose the kind of replication to start (diskless or
not) when master and slave are of different versions. (Oran Agra,
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Log clients details when SLAVEOF command is received. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo with inputs from Nick Craver and Marc Gravell).

\* [FIX] A number of typos fixed inside comments. (Various authors)
\* [FIX] redis-cli no longer quits after long timeouts. (Matt Stancliff)

--[ Redis 2.8.17 ] Release date: 19 Sep 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis Sentinel.
LOW for Redis Server (unmodified compared to 2.8.16).
\* [FIX] Resolved a memory leak in the hiredis library causing a memory leak
in Redis Sentinel when a monitored instance or another Sentinel is
unavailable. Every reconnection attempt will leak a small amount of
memory, but in the long run the process can reach a considerable size.
--[ Redis 2.8.16 ] Release date: 16 Sep 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis if you are using 2.8.15 + AOF.
LOW for Sentinel.
\* [FIX] The ability to load truncated AOF files introduced with Redis 2.8.15
contains a bug fixed in this release: after loading the file was not
truncated to the last valid command, so the new commands are appended
after a non well formed command. This means that:
1) The first AOF rewrite triggered by the server will automatically
fix the problem.
2) However, if the server is restarted before the rewrite, Redis may
not be able to load the file and you need to manually fix it.
In order to fix a corrupted file you should start the redis-check-aof
utility WITHOUT the --fix option, just to check the offset where the
corruption is found. Around the offset reported by the check utility
you'll find, inside your AOF file, a command which is not complete
according to the Redis protocol. Just remove this incomplete command
leafing the file unaltered before and after the offending command,
and restart the server.
IMPORTANT #1: Redis 2.8.15 is the only stable version of Redis with
this bug so probably no actual real-world problem happened since the
problem is automatically fixed at the first automatic AOF rewrite.
IMPORTANT #2: Before upgrading to Redis 2.8.16, if you are using Redis
2.8.15 with AOF enabled, make sure to trigger a manual AOF rewrite
using the BGREWRITEAOF command.
\* [FIX] SAVE is no longer propagated to AOF / slaves.
--[ Redis 2.8.15 ] Release date: 12 Sep 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW for Redis, HIGH for Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel critical bug fixed: the absolute majority was computed in a
wrong way because of a programming error. Now the implementation does
what the specification says and the majority to authorize a failover
(that should not be confused with the ODOWN quorum) is the majority of
\*all\* the Sentinels ever seen for a given master, regardless of their
current state.
\* [FIX] GETRANGE test no longer fails for 32 bit builds (Matt Stancliff).
\* [FIX] Limit SCAN latency when the hash table is in an odd state (very few
populted buckets because rehashing is in progress). (Xiaost and
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Redis is now able to load truncated AOF files without requiring a
redis-check-aof utility run. The default now is to load truncated
(but apparently not corrupted) AOFs, you can change this in redis.conf.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* [NEW] Sentinel: ability to announce itself with an arbitrary IP/port to work
in the context of natted networks. However this is probably still
not enough since there is no equivalent mechanism for slaves listed
in the master INFO output. (Dara Kong and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 2.8.14 ] Release date: 1 Sep 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Lua scripting users, the server could crash because

\* [FIX] Different small redis-cli fixes. (Dov Murik, Charsyam, cubicdaiya,
Kashif Rasul, Jan-Erik Rediger, Matt Stancliff)

\* [NEW] Update used memory with C11 \_\_atomic. (Matt Stancliff)
--[ Redis 2.8.12 ] Release date: 23 Jun 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis, CRITICAL for Sentinel.
# WARNING: This release contains a non backward compatible semantical change
to Lua script that should affect an almost zero number of users.
\* [FIX / BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY] Using SELECT inside Lua scripts no
longer makes the selected DB to be set in the calling client.
So Lua can still use SELECT, but the client calling the script will
remain set to the original DB. Thix fixes an issue with Redis
replication of Lua scripts that called SELECT without reverting the
selected DB to the original one. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Sentinel failover was instalbe if the master was detected as available
during the failover (especially during manual failovers) because
of an implementation error (lack of checking of
SRI\_PROMOTED flag). (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Cancel SHUTDOWN if initial AOF is being written. (Matt Stancliff)
\* [FIX] Sentinel: bind source address for outcoming connections. (Matt
Stancliff).
\* [FIX] Less timing sensitive Sentinel tests. (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* [NEW] redis-cli --intrinsic-latency stopped with SIGINT still reports
stats (Matt Stancliff)
\* [NEW] Sentinels broadcast an HELLO message ASAP after a failover in order to
reach a consistent state faster (before it relied for periodic HELLO
messages). (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* [NEW] Jemalloc updated to 3.6.0. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLIENT LIST speedup. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLIENT LIST new unique incremental ID to every client. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] ROLE command added. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLIENT KILL new form to kill by client type and ID (see doc at
redis.io for more info). (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Sentinel now disconnects clients when instances are reconfigured
(see http://redis.io/topics/sentinel-clients). (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Hiredis update to latest version. (Matt Stancliff)
--[ Redis 2.8.11 ] Release date: 11 Jun 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH if you use Lua scripting, LOW otherwise.
\* [FIX] A previous fix for Lua -> Redis numerical precision enhancement
introduced a new problem. In Redis 2.8.10 commands called from Lua
passing a string that "looks like" a very large number, may actually
use as argument the string converted as a float. This bug is now
fixed.
\* [FIX] Now commands other than \*PUSH\* adding elements to a list will be able
to awake clients blocked in a blocking POP operation.
\* [FIX] Cygwin compilation fixes.
--[ Redis 2.8.10 ] Release date: 5 Jun 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH if you use min-slaves-to-write option.
\* [FIX] IMPORTANT! A min-slaves-to-write option active in a slave totally
prevented the slave from acception the master stream of commands.
This release includes testes for min-slaves-to-write, and a fix
for this issue.
\* [FIX] Sometimes DEL returned 1 for already expired keys. Fixed.
\* [FIX] Fix test false positive because new osx 'leaks' output.
\* [FIX] PFCOUNT HLL cache invalidation fixed: no wrong value was reported
but the cache was not used at all, leading to lower performances.
\* [FIX] Accept(2) multiple clients per readable-event invocation, and better
processing of I/O while loading or busy running a timedout script.
Basically now the LOADING / BUSY errors are reported at a decent
speed.
\* [FIX] A softwaer watchdog crash fixed.
\* [FIX] Fixed a Lua -> Redis numerical precision loss.
\* [NEW] Lua scripting engine speed improved.
\* [NEW] Sentinel generates one new event for humans to understand better
what is happening during a failover: +config-update-from.
Also the time at which a failover will be re-attempted is logged.
--[ Redis 2.8.9 ] Release date: 22 Apr 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW, only new features introduced, no bugs fixed.
\* [NEW] The HyperLogLog data structure. You can read more about it
in this blog post. http://antirez.com/news/75
\* [NEW] The Sorted Set data type has now support for lexicographic range
queries, check the new commands ZRANGEBYLEX, ZLEXCOUNT and
ZREMRANGEBYLEX, which are documented at http://redis.io.
--[ Redis 2.8.8 ] Release date: 25 Mar 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. There is a potentially
critical bug fix causing data loss in Redis but it requires
a combination of disk full and the use of the
SHUTDOWN command.
\* [FIX] Fixed data loss when SHUTDOWN was used with a disk full condition.
\* [FIX] Fixed a memory leak in the SORT syntax error processing.
\* [FIX] When Sentinel down-after-milliseconds parameter is modified at runtime
now it gets propagated to all the slaves and sentinel instances
of the master.
\* [FIX] `install\_server.sh` script finally fixed.
\* [FIX] Different fixes to maxclients handling.
\* [NEW] Sentinels are now able to send update messages in a peer-to-peer
fashion even if no Redis instances are available. Now the Sentinel
liveness property that the most updated configuration in a given
partition is propagated to all the Sentinels is extended to partitions
without reachable instances.
\* [NEW] Sentinel safety properties are now ensured in a crash-recovery system
model since some state is persisted on disk before replying to other
nodes, and reloaded at startup.
\* [NEW] Sentinel now uses CLIENT SETNAME so that it is easy to identify
Sentinels using CLIENT LIST among other clients.
\* [NEW] Sentinel failure detection and reconnection code improved.
\* [NEW] Use all 24 bits (instead of 22) for the Redis objects LRU field.
Note that the new LRU algorithm using eviction pools was not backported
from unstable for safery / code maturity concerns.
\* [NEW] Majory speedup for the INFO command (it is now 6 times faster).
\* [NEW] More Sentinel unit tests.
\* [NEW] New command DEBUG ERROR returns the specified error. Example:
DEBUG ERROR "LOADING database". This is handy to write Redis client
libraries unit tests.
\* [NEW] redis-cli now supports multi-line editing via updated linenoise lib.
Thanks to Matt Stancliff and Jan-Erik Rediger for the work done in the context
of this release.
--[ Redis 2.8.7 ] Release date: 5 Mar 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. However this release adds
new features so users may want to upgrade in order to
exploit the new functionalities.
\* [FIX] Sometimes the absolute config file path was obtained in a wrong way.
This happened when there was a "dir" directive inside the config file
and at the same time the configuration file was given as a relative
path to redis-server or redis-sentinel executables.
\* [FIX] redis-cli: Automatically enter --slave mode when SYNC or PSYNC are
called during an interactive session.
\* [FIX] Sentinel "IDONTKNOW" error removed as it does not made sense with the
new Sentinel design. This error was actually a fix for a design error
in the first implementation of Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel: added a missing exit() call to abort after config file
checks at startup. This error was introduced with an improvement in
a previous 2.8 release.
\* [FIX] BITCOUNT: fixed unaligned access causing issues in sparc and other
archs not capable of dealing with unaligned accesses. This also makes
the code faster in archs where unaligned accesses are allowed.
\* [FIX] Sentinel: better nodes fail over start time desynchronization to avoid
split-brain during the voting process needed to get authorization to
fail over. This means the system is less likely to need to retry
and will fail over faster. No changes in behavior / correctness.
\* [FIX] Force INFO used\_memory\_peak to match peak memory. This generated some
confusion among users even if it was not an actual bug.
\* [NEW] Sentinel unit tests and framework. More tests needed and units must
be improved in order to have less false positives, but it is a start
and features a debugging console that is useful to fix tests or to
inspect bugs causing tests failures.
\* [NEW] New Sentinel events: +/-monitor and +set used to monitor when an
instance to monitor is added or removed, or when a configuration
is modified via SENTINEL SET.
\* [NEW] Redis-cli updated to use SCAN instead of random sampling via
RANDOMKEY in order to implement --bigkeys feature. Moreover the
implementation now supports pipelining and reports more information
at the end of the scan. Much faster, much better. A special thank
you to Michael Grunder for this improvement.
\* [NEW] redis-cli now supports a new --intrinsic-latency mode that is able
to meter the latency of a system due to kernel / hypervisor.
How to use it is explained at http://redis.io/topics/latency.
\* [NEW] New command BITPOS: find first bit set or clear in a bitmap.
\* [NEW] CONFIG REWRITE calls are now logged.
--[ Redis 2.8.6 ] Release date: 13 Feb 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. Redis users using Lua
scripts with EVALSHA and attached slaves and/or AOF
persistence should consider upgrading ASAP.
\* [FIX] Fixed an critical EVALSHA script cache bug: scripts executed may not
propagate to AOF / Slaves correctly under certain conditions.
See issue #1549 at Github for more information.
\* [FIX] Fixed multiple bugs resulting into closing the link with master or slave
during replication without good reasons. This will result in useless
resynchronizations, or infinite loops where the replication link can't
be established.
\* [FIX] Don't count the time needed to populate the buffers of clients waiting
in MONITOR mode when populating the Slow Log entries.
\* [NEW] AOF write errors (like no space on device) no longer abort Redis if the
fsync policy is none or every second. The database enters a read-only
mode where every write is refused with an error. Normal operations are
restored as soon as Redis is able to append again data to the AOF file.
\* [NEW] Sentinel now accepts SHUTDOWN command.
--[ Redis 2.8.5 ] Release date: 4 Feb 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH for Redis, LOW for Sentinel. Redis users using Lua
scripts with expires, and Redis users relying on the
ability of Redis to block writes on RDB saving errors
should plan to upgrade ASAP.
\* [FIX] Fixed a replication bug caused by Lua scripts + expired keys: keys could
expire in the middle of scripts causing non-deterministic behavior.
\* [FIX] MISCONFIG error if condition fixed, the server was no longer able
to stop writes on RDB misconfiguration after this error was introduced.
\* [FIX] REDIS\_AOF\_REWRITE\_MIN\_SIZE is now 64mb like example redis.conf default.
\* [FIX] Perform fflush() before fsync() in rio.c (bug without actual effects).
\* [FIX] Don't log MONITOR clients as disconnecting slaves.
\* [FIX] SENTINEL MASTER arity check fixed. Crashed the Sentinel instance when
the command was given without arguments.
\* [NEW] Allow CONFIG and SHUTDOWN while in stale-slave state.
\* [NEW] Support for configurable TCP listen(2) backlog size.
\* [NEW] redis-cli supports SCAN via the --scan and --pattern options.
\* [NEW] SENTINEL SET master quorum via runtime API implemented.
--[ Redis 2.8.4 ] Release date: 13 Jan 2014
# UPGRADE URGENCY: MODERATE for Redis and Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Makefile compatibility with non common make variants improved.
\* [FIX] SDIFF crash in very unlikely to trigger state fixed.
\* [FIX] Config rewriting fixed: don't wipe options unknown to the rewrite
process.
\* [FIX] Set TCP port to 0 works again to disable TCP networking.
\* [FIX] Fixed replication with old Redis instances as masters by not
sending REPLCONF ACK to them.
\* [FIX] Fix keyspace notifications rewrite and CONFIG GET output.
\* [FIX] Fix RESTORE TTL handling in 32 bit systems (32 bit overflow).
\* [NEW] Sentinel now has a run time configuration API.
\* [NEW] Log when we lost connection with master or slave.
\* [NEW] When instance is turned from slave to master now inherits the
old master replication offset when possible. This improves the
Sentinel failover procedure.
--[ Redis 2.8.3 ] Release date: 11 Dec 2013
# UPGRADE URGENCY: MODERATE for Redis, HIGH for Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel instance role sampling fixed, the system is now more
reliable during failover and when reconfiguring instances with
non matching configuration.
\* [FIX] Inline requests are now handled even when terminated with just LF.
\* [FIX] Replication timeout handling greatly improved, now the slave is able
to ping the master while removing the old data from memory, and while
loading the new RDB file. This avoid false timeouts sensed by
masters.
\* [FIX] Fixed a replication bug involving 32 bit instances and big datasets
hard to compress that resulted into more than 2GB of RDB file sent.
\* [FIX] Return error for inline requests with unbalanced quotes.
\* [FIX] Publish the slave replication offset even when disconnected from the
master if there is still a cached master instance.
--[ Redis 2.8.2 ] Release date: 2 Dec 2013
# UPGRADE URGENCY: MODERATE for both Redis and Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel better desynchronization to avoid split-brain elections
where no Sentinel managed to get elected.
\* [FIX] Stop accepting writes on "MISCONF" error only if master, not slave.
\* [FIX] Reply to PING with an error on "MISCONF" errors.
--[ Redis 2.8.1 ] Release date: 25 Nov 2013
# UPGRADE URGENCY: LOW for Redis, CRITICAL for Senitnel. You don't need to
upgrade your Redis instances but it is highly recommended

\* [FIX] Fixed an error in rdbWriteRaw() that should have no practical impact.
\* [NEW] Log the new master when SLAVEOF command is used.
\* [NEW] Sentinel code synchronized with the unstable branch, the new Sentinel
is a reimplementation that uses more reliable algorithms.

--[ Redis 2.8 Release Candidate 2 (2.7.102) ] Release date: 30 Jul 2013
This is the second release candidate of Redis 2.8 (official version is 2.7.102).
Important bugs fixed inside.
# UPGRADE URGENCY: HIGH
\* [FIX] Fixed a critical replication bug, see issue #1221.
\* [NEW] The new inline protocol now accepts quoted strings like, for example
you can now type in a telnet session: set 'foo bar' "hello world\n".
--[ Redis 2.8 Release Candidate 1 (2.7.101) ] Release date: 18 Jul 2013
This is the first release candidate of Redis 2.8 (official version is 2.7.101).
The following is a list of improvements in Redis 2.8, compared to Redis 2.6.
\* [NEW] Slaves are now able to partially resynchronize with the master, so most
of the times a full resynchronization with the RDB creation in the master
side is not needed when the master-slave link is disconnected for a short
amount of time.
\* [NEW] Experimental IPv6 support.
\* [NEW] Slaves explicitly ping masters now, a master is able to detect a timed out
slave independently.
\* [NEW] Masters can stop accepting writes if not enough slaves with a given
maximum latency are connected.
\* [NEW] Keyspace changes notifications via Pub/Sub.
\* [NEW] CONFIG SET maxclients is now available.
\* [NEW] Ability to bind multiple IP addresses.
\* [NEW] Set process names so that you can recognize, in the "ps" command output,
the listening port of an instance, or if it is a saving child.
\* [NEW] Automatic memory check on crash.
\* [NEW] CONFIG REWRITE is able to materialize the changes in the configuration
operated using CONFIG SET into the redis.conf file.
\* [NEW] More NetBSD friendly code base.
\* [NEW] PUBSUB command for Pub/Sub introspection capabilities.
\* [NEW] EVALSHA can now be replicated as such, without requiring to be expanded
to a full EVAL for the replication link.
\* [NEW] Better Lua scripts error reporting.
\* [NEW] SDIFF performance improved.
\* [FIX] A number of bugfixes.
Migrating from 2.6 to 2.8
=========================
Redis 2.6 is mostly a strict subset of 2.8. However there are a few things
that you should be aware of:
The following commands changed behavior:
\* The TTL and PTTL commands now return -2 if the key does not exist and
-1 if it exists but has no associated expire. Redis 2.6 and previous
versions used to return -1 for both the conditions.
\* SORT with ALPHA now sorts according to local collation locale if no STORE
option is used.
\* ZADD/ZINCRBY are now able to accept a bigger range of values as valid
scores, that is, all the values you may end having as a result of
calling ZINCRBY multiple times.
\* Many errors are now prefixed by a more specific error code instead of
the generic -ERR, for example -WRONGTYPE, -NOAUTH, ...
\* PUBLISH called inside Lua scripts is now correctly propagated to slaves.
The following redis.conf and CONFIG GET / SET parameters changed:
\* logfile now uses the empty string in order to log to standard output,
so 'logfile stdout' is now invalid, use 'logfile ""' instead.
The following INFO fields changed format in a non-backward compatible way:
\* The list of slaves in INFO is now in field=value format.
Replication:
Redis 2.8 can be used as slave for Redis 2.6, but doing this is only
a good idea for the short amount of time needed to upgrade your servers.
We suggest to update both master and slaves at about the same time.

Redis 3.0 release notes
=======================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:
LOW: No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH: There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--[ Redis 3.0.7 ] Release date: 28 jan 2016
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: this release fixes important Redis Cluster bugs.
\* [FIX] avg\_ttl reporting in INFO improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Redis Cluster address update (via gossip section) processing improved
to avoid initiating inwanted handshakes.
\* [FIX] Many fixes to MIGRATE multiple keys implementation. The command
could handle errors in a faulty way leading to crashes or other
unexpected behaviors. MIGRATE command refactoring.
(The analysis of the faulty conditions was conducted by
Kevin McGehee. The fix was developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] A Redis Cluster node crash was fixed because of wrong handling of
node->slaveof pointers.
(Reported by JackyWoo, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fix redis-trib rebalance when nodes need to be left empty because
the specified weight is zero.
(Reported by Shahar Mor, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] MIGRATE: Never send -ASK redirections for MIGRATE when there are
open slots. Redis-trib and other cluster management utility must
always be free to move keys between nodes about open slots, in order
to reshard, fix the cluster configuration, and so forth.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Redis-trib is now able to fix more errors. A new CLUSTER subcommand
called BUMPEPOCH was introduced in order to support new modes
for the "fix" subcommand. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster/Sentinel tests now use OSX leak to perform leak detection
at the end of every unit. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Detect and show server crashes during Cluster/Sentinel tests.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] More reliable Cluster/Sentinel test becuase of timing errors and
-LOADING errors. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 3.0.6 ] Release date: 18 Dec 2015
Upgrade urgency: MODERATE. We fixed a crash that happens very rarely, so
updating does not hurt, but most users are unlikely to
experience this condition because it requires some odd
timing. However if you are a Redis Cluster user, upgrading
is strongly adviced since this release includes very
important improvements to Redis Cluster.
\* [FIX] lua\_struct.c/getnum security issue fixed. (Luca Bruno discovered it,
patched by Sun He and Chris Lamb)
\* [FIX] Redis Cluster replica migration fixed. See issue #2924 for details.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fix a race condition in processCommand() because of interactions
with freeMemoryIfNeeded(). Details in issue #2948 and especially
in the commit message d999f5a. (Race found analytically by
Oran Agra, patch by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Backported from the upcoming Redis 3.2:
MIGRATE now supports an extended multiple-keys pipelined mode, which
is an order of magnitude faster. Redis Cluster now uses this mode
in order to perform reshardings and rebalancings. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Backported from the upcoming Redis 3.2:
Redis Cluster has now support for rebalancing via the redis-trib
rebalance command. Demo here:
https://asciinema.org/a/0tw2e5740kouda0yhkqrm5790
Official documentation will be available ASAP. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Redis Cluster redis-trib.rb new "info" subcommand.
\* [NEW] Redis Cluster tests improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Log offending memory access address on SIGSEGV/SIGBUS (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 3.0.5 ] Release date: 15 Oct 2015
Upgrade urgency: MODERATE, the most important thing is a fix in the replication
code that may make the slave hanging forever if the master
remains with an open socket even if it is no longer able to
reply.
\* [FIX] MOVE now moves the TTL as well. A bug lasting forever... finally
fixed thanks to Andy Grunwald that reported it.
(reported by Andy Grunwald, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fix a false positive in HSTRLEN test.
\* [FIX] Fix a bug in redis-cli --pipe mode that was not able to read back
replies from the server incrementally. Now a mass import will use
a lot less memory, and you can use --pipe to do incremental streaming.
(reported by Twitter user @fsaintjacques, fixed by Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Slave detection of master timeout. (fixed by Kevin McGehee, refactoring
and regression test by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster: redis-trib fix can fix an additional case for opens lots.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster: redis-trib import support for --copy and --replace options
(David Thomson)
--[ Redis 3.0.4 ] Release date: 8 Sep 2015
Upgrade urgency: HIGH for Redis and Sentinel. However note that in order to
fix certain replication bugs, the replication internals were
modified in a very heavy way. So while this release is
conceptually saner, it may contain regressions. For this
reason, before the release, QA activities were performed by
me (antirez) and Redis Labs and no evident bug was found.
\* [FIX] A number of bugs related to replication PSYNC and the (yet experimental)
diskless replication feature were fixed. The bugs could lead to
inconsistency between masters and slaves. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran
Agra fixed the issue found by Yuval Inbar)
\* [FIX] A replication bug in the context of PSYNC partial resynchonization was
found and fixed. This bug happens even when diskless replication is off
in the case different slaves connect at different times while the master
is creating an RDB file, and later a partial resynchronization is
attempted by a slave that connected not as the first one. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)
\* [FIX] Chained replication and PSYNC interactions leading to potential stale
chained slaves data set, see issue #2694. (Salvatore Sanfilippo fixed
an issue reported by "GeorgeBJ" user at Github)
\* [FIX] redis-cli --scan iteration fixed when returned cursor overflows
32 bit signed integer. (Ofir Luzon, Yuval Inbar)
\* [FIX] Sentinel: fixed a bug during the master switch process, where for a
failed conditional check, the new configuration is rewritten, during
a small window of time, in a corrupted way where the master is
also reported to be one of the slaves. This bug is rare to trigger
but apparently it happens in the wild, and the effect is to see
a replication loop where the master will try to replicate with itself.
A detailed explanation of the bug and its effects can be found in
the commit message here: https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/c20218eb5770b2cafb12bc7092313b8358fedc0a.
The bug was found by Jan-Erik Rediger using a static analyzer and
fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo.
\* [FIX] Sentinel lack of arity checks for certain commands.
(Rogerio Goncalves, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Replication internals rewritten in order to be more resistant to bugs.
The replication handshake in the slave side was rewritten as a non
blocking state machine. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra)
\* [NEW] New "replication capabilities" feature introduced in order to signal
from the master to the slave what are the features supported, so that
the master can choose the kind of replication to start (diskless or
not) when master and slave are of different versions. (Oran Agra,
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Log clients details when SLAVEOF command is received. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo with inputs from Nick Craver and Marc Gravell).
--[ Redis 3.0.3 ] Release date: 17 Jul 2015
Upgrade urgency: LOW for Redis and Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Fix blocking operations timeout precision when HZ is at its default
value (not increased) and there are thousands of clients connected
at the same time. This bug affected Sidekiq users that experienced
a very long delay for BLPOP and similar commands to return for
timeout. Check commit b029ff1 for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] MIGRATE "creating socket: Invalid argument" error fix. Check
issues #2609 and #2612 for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Be able to connect to the master even when the slave is bound to
just the loopback interface and has no valid public address in the
network the master is reacahble. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] ZADD with options encoding promotion fixed. (linfangrong)
\* [FIX] Reset aof\_delayed\_fsync on CONFIG RESETSTATS. (Tom Kiemes)
\* [FIX] PFCOUNT key parsing in cluster fixed. (MOON\_CLJ)
\* [FIX] Fix Solaris compilation of Redis 3.0. (Jan-Erik Rediger)
\* [NEW] Variadic EXISTS command. Now the command accepts multiple arguments
and returns the total count of existing keys.
--[ Redis 3.0.2 ] Release date: 4 Jun 2015
Upgrade urgency: HIGH for Redis because of a security issue.
LOW for Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Critical security issue fix by Ben Murphy: http://t.co/LpGTyZmfS7
\* [FIX] SMOVE reply fixed when src and dst keys are the same. (Glenn Nethercutt)
\* [FIX] Lua cmsgpack lib updated to support str8 type. (Sebastian Waisbrot)
\* [NEW] ZADD support for options: NX, XX, CH. See new doc at redis.io.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Senitnel: CKQUORUM and FLUSHCONFIG commands back ported.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo and Bill Anderson)
--[ Redis 3.0.1 ] Release date: 5 May 2015
Upgrade urgency: LOW for Redis and Cluster, MODERATE for Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel memory leak due to hiredis fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Sentinel memory leak on duplicated instance. (Charsyam)
\* [FIX] Redis crash on Lua reaching output buffer limits. (Yossi Gottlieb)
\* [FIX] Sentinel flushes config on +slave events. (Bill Anderson)
--[ Redis 3.0.0 ] Release date: 1 Apr 2015
>> What's new in Redis 3.0 compared to Redis 2.8?
\* Redis Cluster: a distributed implementation of a subset of Redis.
\* New "embedded string" object encoding resulting in less cache
misses. Big speed gain under certain work loads.
\* AOF child -> parent final data transmission to minimize latency due
to "last write" during AOF rewrites.
\* Much improved LRU approximation algorithm for keys eviction.
\* WAIT command to block waiting for a write to be transmitted to
the specified number of slaves.
\* MIGRATE connection caching. Much faster keys migraitons.
\* MIGRATE new options COPY and REPLACE.
\* CLIENT PAUSE command: stop processing client requests for a
specified amount of time.
\* BITCOUNT performance improvements.
\* CONFIG SET accepts memory values in different units (for example
you can use "CONFIG SET maxmemory 1gb").
\* Redis log format slightly changed reporting in each line the role of the
instance (master/slave) or if it's a saving child log.
\* INCR performance improvements.
>> Refactoring changes (no new features nor bug fixes)
\* Blocking operations full refactoring (blocked.c)
\* Client output buffer memory tracking refactored.
Changes between RC6 and 3.0.0 stable:
>> General changes
\* Fixes to diskless replication. (Oran Agra)
\* Test for BLPOP replication on role change. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* prepareClientToWrite() error handling improvements. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Remove dict.c no longer used function. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
None
>> Sentinel changes
None
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC6 (version 2.9.106) ] Release date: 24 mar 2015
Upgrade urgency: HIGH because of bugs related to Redis Custer and replication.
This is the 6th release candidate of Redis 3.0.0. This release fixes important
issues discovered during stress testing, and implements safest behavior
for blocking operations during clients reshardings, and a new much needed
functionality of Redis Cluster manual failovers.
In order to fix certain bugs quite a bit of refactoring was needed which
is usually non advisabble in a Release Candidate, but needed in order to
end with a clean fix.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Redis (non clustered & clustered) replication bug involving blocking
operations: see issue #2473. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] clientsArePaused() fix crashing the old master during manual failover.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Lua scripts replication in Redis Cluster was totally broken.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Redirect clients blocked into list operations when the hash slot
they are blocked into is migrated to another instance or the cluster
state turns into "fail". (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] TAKEOVER option for CLUSTER FAILOVER implemented. It is now possible
to fix a cluster manually in the minority side of the partition, for
example in order to allow for multi DC setups & recovery.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Sentinel changes
No changes in Sentinel.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC5 (version 2.9.105) ] Release date: 20 mar 2015
Upgrade urgency: Moderate for Redis Cluster users, low otherwise.
This is the 5th release candidate of Redis 3.0.0, released in order to fix
a moderate bug in Redis Cluster. This RC does not shift in the future the
Redis 3.0.0 final release which is scheduled in a few days (we are in the
process of finishing the documentation for Redis Cluster).
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Fix LATENCY command crash. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, thx to Ingmar)
\* [FIX] Config: missing activerehashing option support in CONFIG SET added.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo, thx to Bill Anderson)
\* [FIX] Fix for backtrace generation issue. (Mariano Pérez Rodríguez, Matt Stancliff, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Redis-cli --latency-dist backported from unstable.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Avoid redundant SELECT in MIGRATE. (Tommy Wang, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] More robust slave check in CLUSTER REPLICATE. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fixed possible Redis Cluster node crash due to wrong separation of
concerns between getNodeByQuery() and Cluster global state update
fnuction. (Salvatore Sanfilippo, thx to Ingmar)
\* [NEW] Add command CLUSTER MYID to easily featch instance ID. (Michel Martens)
>> Sentinel changes
\* [NEW] Support for CLIENT command added. It was missing in the command table.
(Leandro López)
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC4 (version 2.9.104) ] Release date: 13 feb 2015
Upgrade urgency: High for Redis if you use LRU eviction, low otherwise.
This is the 4th release candidate of Redis 3.0.0, it fixes problems with
LRU eviction that are not present in older release (2.8.x is not affected)
and adds new tools to inspect latency and load-test LRU.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] redis-cli CSV output NIL spurious newline removed. (Matt Collier)
\* [FIX] Memory efficiency test in unit test is now much faster: it affacted
the total "make test" execution time in a bad way. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fixes and improvements to dict.c and LRU eviction. Redis 3.0.0 new
LRU eviction had bugs creating high latency spikes when LRU was
happening during the keys dictionary rehashing. This bug is not
present into 2.8, was 3.0 specific. As a side effect of this issue
dict.c is now improved, and LRU algorithm is more precise (better
approximates true LRU). This was a joint effort, see issue
#2306 for details. (Oran Agra, Sun He, Salvatore Sanfilippo).
Thanks to Charsyam for spotting an integer overflow.
\* [NEW] New latency tool: redis-cli --latency-dist is able to show an
xterm-256 based spectrum of latencies over time. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] redis-cli --lru-test implemented (cache workload simulator). (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] redis-cli --stat now shows LOAD when Redis is loading data.
\* [NEW] Support "1G" etc. units in CONFIG SET. (Chris Lamb, Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* None.
>> Sentinel changes
\* None.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC3 (version 2.9.103) ] Release date: 30 jan 2015
Upgrade urgency: High for Redis Cluster users, low otherwise.
This is the third release candidate for Redis 3.0.0, the new RC fixes
several critical issues with Redis Cluster.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] AOF bug unlikely to happen in practice and mostly harmless: child
process segfaults when parent is not reachable via pipe. (Sun He)
\* [FIX] Scripting engine now reports an error when misused with Lua debug
hooks, instead of crashing. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Several issues with Redis Cluster internal nodes objects handling.
(Matt Stancliff & Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Improvements in the Cluster test.
(Matt Stancliff & Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* [FIX] Cluster memory leaks / double frees (Matt Stancliff).
\* [FIX] /dev/urandom surrogate for generation of unique IDs in a more
cheap way. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fixes and improvements to PING / PONG packets gossip sections
in order to improve (and fix) failure detection and speedup
cluster info propagation. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLUSTER count-failure-reports command added. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Sentinel changes
No changes for Sentinel.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC2 (version 2.9.102) ] Release date: 13 jan 2015
Upgrade urgency: LOW.
This is the second release candidate of Redis 3.0.0. The major changes
are back porting of things implemented into the unstable branch while
this was still possible (with the new development model adopted only
bug fixes will be merged in the future).
RC2 also fixes a few Redis Cluster non critical bugs.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] A number of minor bug fixes.
\* [NEW] Diskless replication backportede.
\* [NEW] Lua bitops and updated cmsgpack backported.
\* [NEW] Transparent Huge Pages warnings and reporting backported.
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Fix PUBLISH cluster bus message count field.
\* [FIX] It is no longer possible to write outside node hash slots using Lua.
\* [FIX] Valgrind warnings (no actual bugs).
\* [FIX] Less strict in acceptiong myself->ip if it's not populated.
\* [NEW] Better testing of Lua scripts.
>> Sentinel changes
No changes to Sentinel.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 RC1 (version 2.9.101) ] Release date: 9 oct 2014
This is the first release candidate of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] An very large number of small fixes, old and new, merged in the
context of a the issue #1906. Please see the issue page here
for exact credits: https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/1906
of each commit. (Matt Stancliff and many others).
\* [FIX] SAVE is no longer propagated to AOF / slaves.
\* [FIX] GETRANGE test no longer fails for 32 bit builds (Matt Stancliff).
\* [FIX] Limit SCAN latency when the hash table is in an odd state (very few
populted buckets because rehashing is in progress). (Xiaost and
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Redis is now able to load truncated AOF files without requiring a
redis-check-aof utility run. The default now is to load truncated
(but apparently not corrupted) AOFs, you can change this in redis.conf.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* [NEW] DEBUG POPULATE two args form implemented. It is now possible to
call it with DEBUG POPULATE  . Default prefix
is "key:" as usually.
\* [NEW] INCR: Modify incremented object in-place when possible. This results
in speed improvements + possibly better memory locality.
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Cluster: claim ping\_sent time even if we can't connect.
\* [FIX] redis-trib should not abort easily on connection issues.
\* [FIX] Cluster test: less console-spammy resharding test.
\* [FIX] Fix logic to detect we are among a minority.
\* [FIX] Process gossip section only for known nodes.
\* [NEW] Redis Cluster is stable and tested enough, there is a clear MVP,
so it was promoted from beta to stable.
\* [NEW] New unit 09, Pub/Sub across the cluster.
\* [NEW] New unit 08, update messages.
\* [NEW] New cluster option to work with partial slots coverage.
\* [NEW] More chatty cluster slaves when failover is stalled. They log reason
with rate limiting, only when reason changes or a given time
has elapsed.
>> Sentinel changes
\* [FIX] Sentinel critical bug fixed: the absolute majority was computed in a
wrong way because of a programming error. Now the implementation does
what the specification says and the majority to authorize a failover
(that should not be confused with the ODOWN quorum) is the majority of
\*all\* the Sentinels ever seen for a given master, regardless of their
current state.
\* [FIX] Resolved a memory leak in the hiredis library causing a memory leak
in Redis Sentinel when a monitored instance or another Sentinel is
unavailable. Every reconnection attempt will leak a small amount of
memory, but in the long run the process can reach a considerable size.
\* [NEW] Sentinel: ability to announce itself with an arbitrary IP/port to work
in the context of natted networks. However this is probably still
not enough since there is no equivalent mechanism for slaves listed
in the master INFO output. (Dara Kong and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 8 (version 2.9.57) ] Release date: 29 jul 2014
This is the 8th beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Solaris compilation issues. (Matt Stancliff, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Allow shared integer objects if maxmemory policy is not LRU based.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] PFSELFTEST: less false positives. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fail SYNC if background save child aborted due to a signal. (Yossi
Gottlieb)
\* [NEW] Latency framework backported from unstable branch. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] AOF rewrite improved for latency. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Pub/Sub PING. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Much faster ZUNIONSTORE. (Kyle Hubert, Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Faster ll2string() implementation. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] CLUSTER RESET: Flush slave dataset on reset. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Replica migration: don't migrate to masters that never had slaves
in the past, but only to masters that remained orphaned after
failure events. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] redis-trib: allow to reshard in non-interactive way. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster test: unit 04, check consistency during resharding. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster test: unit 05, slave selection. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster test: unit 06, slaves with stale data can't failover. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster test: unit 07, replicas migration. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Sentinel changes
\* No Sentinel changes in this release.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 7 (version 2.9.56) ] Release date: 30 jun 2014
This is the 7th beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Scripting fixes backported from unstable, see Redis 2.8.12 changelog
for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Cancel SHUTDOWN if initial AOF is being written. (Matt Stancliff)
\* [NEW] New command: COMMAND, for commands introspection (Matt Stancliff &
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] hiredis: Update to latest version. (Matt Stancliff)
\* [NEW] Jemalloc updated to 3.6.0. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Cluster: clear NOADDR flag when updating node address.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] New CLUSTER SLOTS command to simplify Cluster clients operations.
(Matt Stancliff)
\* [NEW] More Cluster tests. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Log when failover authorization are granted / denied.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
>> Sentinel changes
\* [FIX] A few Sentinel bugs fixed and improvements, see Redis 2.8.12
changelog for more info. (Salvatore Sanfilippo & Matt Stancliff)
\* [NEW] New Sentinel-Client handshake protocol, ROLE command, CLIENT KILL,
all backported to 3.0 branch. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 6 (version 2.9.55) ] Release date: 9 jun 2014
This is the 6th beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Fix software watchdog signal handler crash due to re-entering.
\* [FIX] Better Lua number -> string conversion for Lua scripts.
\* [FIX] Serious replication bug when min-slaves-\* feature is used in slaves
configuration fixed.
\* [FIX] Blocking pop on lists now works when the list is created by commands
other than \*PUSH\* (for example SORT STORE).
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] CRITICAL: For a bug in the implementation of CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH
introduced with beta-3 (especially beta-4 where the command
is actually used by redis-trib), a configEpoch for a node could
jump backward, breaking the eventual consistency property of the
slots -> nodes mapping in the cluster.
>> Sentinel changes
\* No changes for Sentinel in this release.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 5 (version 2.9.54) ] Release date: 26 may 2014
This is the 5th beta of Redis 3.0.0. It does not include any real
worthwhile change (just three days passed since the previous beta), but
fixes two stupid bugs preventing cluster tests to pass.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 4 (version 2.9.53) ] Release date: 23 may 2014
This is the fourth beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [NEW] Scripting engine performances improvements.
\* [NEW] Log format slightly changed to report current node role.
\* [FIX] Correct the HyperLogLog stale cache flag to prevent unnecessary
computation.
>> Cluster changes
\* [NEW] redis-trib: ability to import data from standalone Redis instances.
\* [NEW] redis-trib: "fix" subcommand much better at fixing errors.
\* [NEW] CLUSTER FAILOVER FORCE implemented.
\* [NEW] CLUSTER RESET implemented, it is now possible to completely reset
nodes and create a new cluster without restarting anything.
\* [NEW] Slave validity factor (max estimated data age to still failover)
is now under the control of the user, and can be configured via
redis.conf or CONFIG SET. Option name cluster-slave-validity-factor.
\* [NEW] Cluster test: failure detection and failover initial tests.
\* [NEW] CLUSTER MEET: better error messages when address is invalid.
\* [NEW] Bulk-accept new Cluster nodes in the Cluster bus instead of
performing just a single accept() per event fired.
\* [FIX] Bypass data\_age check for manual failovers.
\* [FIX] Fixed data\_age computation / check integer overflow.
\* [FIX] Various fixes to Tcl client.tcl Redis Cluster client used in tests.
\* [FIX] Better handling of stolen slots.
\* [FIX] Don't accept cluster bus connections during startup.
>> Sentinel changes
\* [NEW] Generate +config-update-from event when a new config is received.
\* [NEW] Log when a failover will be re-attempted again.
\* [FIX] Sentinel: Add "dir /tmp" directive in example sentinel.conf.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 3 (version 2.9.52) ] Release date: 5 may 2014
This is the third beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [NEW] New data structure: the HyperLogLog (see 2.8 release notes).
\* [NEW] Lexicograhical range queries in sorted sets (see 2.8 release notes).
\* [NEW] LRU algorithm precision greatly improved.
\* [FIX] Redis is now much more responsive to reply with LOADING / BUSY errors.
>> Cluster changes
\* [NEW] Cluster testing framework and initial tests.
\* [NEW] Cluster epochs collision resolution (make Redis Cluster more resilient
to admin and programming errors).
\* [NEW] Persist / fsync some global state to ensure correct crash-recovery
semantics.
\* [NEW] New command introduced: CLUSTER SET-CONFIG-EPOCH, still not used
by redis-trib. Will be used to speedup the assignment of unique
epochs to different nodes at cluster creation time. For now this is
handled as a side effect of the cluster epochs collision resolution.
\* [FIX] Different fixes to redis-trib cluster creation.
\* [FIX] Fix an error in the CLUSTER NODES output for nodes slots.
>> Sentinel changes
\* [NEW] Sentinels are now able to send update messages in a peer-to-peer
fashion even if no Redis instances are available. Now the Sentinel
liveness property that the most updated configuration in a given
partition is propagated to all the Sentinels is extended to partitions
without reachable instances.
\* [NEW] Sentinel safety properties are now ensured in a crash-recovery system
model since some state is persisted on disk before replying to other
nodes, and reloaded at startup.
\* [NEW] Sentinel now uses CLIENT SETNAME so that it is easy to identify
Sentinels using CLIENT LIST among other clients.
\* [NEW] Sentinel failure detection and reconnection code improved.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 2 (version 2.9.51) ] Release date: 11 mar 2014
This is the second beta of Redis 3.0.0.
>> General changes
\* [FIX] Sometimes the absolute config file path was obtained in a wrong way.
This happened when there was a "dir" directive inside the config file
and at the same time the configuration file was given as a relative
path to redis-server or redis-sentinel executables.
\* [FIX] redis-cli: Automatically enter --slave mode when SYNC or PSYNC are
called during an interactive session.
\* [FIX] BITCOUNT: fixed unaligned access causing issues in sparc and other
archs not capable of dealing with unaligned accesses. This also makes
the code faster in archs where unaligned accesses are allowed.
\* [FIX] Force INFO used\_memory\_peak to match peak memory. This generated some
confusion among users even if it was not an actual bug.
\* [FIX] Fixed an critical EVALSHA script cache bug: scripts executed may not
propagate to AOF / Slaves correctly under certain conditions.
See issue #1549 at Github for more information.
\* [FIX] Fixed multiple bugs resulting into closing the link with master or slave
during replication without good reasons. This will result in useless
resynchronizations, or infinite loops where the replication link can't
be established.
\* [FIX] Don't count the time needed to populate the buffers of clients waiting
in MONITOR mode when populating the Slow Log entries.
\* [NEW] Redis-cli updated to use SCAN instead of random sampling via
RANDOMKEY in order to implement --bigkeys feature. Moreover the
implementation now supports pipelining and reports more information
at the end of the scan. Much faster, much better. A special thank
you to Michael Grunder for this improvement.
\* [NEW] redis-cli now supports a new --intrinsic-latency mode that is able
to meter the latency of a system due to kernel / hypervisor.
How to use it is explained at http://redis.io/topics/latency.
\* [NEW] New command BITPOS: find first bit set or clear in a bitmap.
\* [NEW] CONFIG REWRITE calls are now logged.
\* [NEW] AOF write errors (like no space on device) no longer abort Redis if the
fsync policy is none or every second. The database enters a read-only
mode where every write is refused with an error. Normal operations are
restored as soon as Redis is able to append again data to the AOF file.
\* [NEW] Sentinel now accepts SHUTDOWN command.
>> Cluster changes
\* [FIX] Bind the first interface listed in the "bind" configuration directive
if any, in order to perform outgoing connections. This fixes Cluster
usage when an address is bound but there are multiple interfaces that
may be used to connect with other nodes.
\* [FIX] When an "Importing" slot is closed via CLUSTER SETSLOT NODE ...
increment the configEpoch in the special case it is zero.
\* [FIX] Current transaction is invalidated on redirection errors.
\* [FIX] Abort if port does not allow for a valid cluster bus port that is
always at fixed +10000 offset.
\* [FIX] Keys extraction algorithm fixed for ZUNIONSTORE/ZINTERSTORE and SORT.
\* [FIX] Better failover timeout and retry times: failover should now work
reliabily when node-timeout is very small (a few milliseconds).
\* [FIX] Don't allow SORT GET/BY options in Cluster mode.
\* [FIX] Clear importing/migrating state when turning from master to slave role.
\* [FIX] Set slot error if we receive an update for a busy slot.
\* [FIX] Update node configEpoch on UPDATE messages.
\* [NEW] Support multi-key operations as long as keys resolve to the same
hash slot, and the slot is not migrating, or it is migrating but all
the mentioned keys are available.
\* [NEW] New DEBUG command CMDKEYS available to debug / test keys identification
in Redis commands.
\* [NEW] redis-trib: create subcommand is now able to assign spare slaves.
\* [NEW] redis-trib: new subcommand 'call'. Exec command in all nodes.
>> Sentinel changes
\* [FIX] Sentinel "IDONTKNOW" error removed as it does not made sense with the
new Sentinel design. This error was actually a fix for a design error
in the first implementation of Sentinel.
\* [FIX] Sentinel: added a missing exit() call to abort after config file
checks at startup. This error was introduced with an improvement in
a previous 2.8 release.
\* [FIX] Sentinel: better nodes fail over start time desynchronization to avoid
split-brain during the voting process needed to get authorization to
fail over. This means the system is less likely to need to retry
and will fail over faster. No changes in behavior / correctness.
\* [NEW] Sentinel unit tests and framework. More tests needed and units must
be improved in order to have less false positives, but it is a start
and features a debugging console that is useful to fix tests or to
inspect bugs causing tests failures.
\* [NEW] New Sentinel events: +/-monitor and +set used to monitor when an
instance to monitor is added or removed, or when a configuration
is modified via SENTINEL SET.
--[ Redis 3.0.0 Beta 1 (version 2.9.50) ] Release date: 11 Feb 2014
This is the first beta of Redis 3.0.0.
Migrating from 2.8 to 3.0
=========================
Redis 2.8 is mostly a strict subset of 3.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 2.8 to 3.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 3.0 release:
\* The log format was modified. The prefix of each line included the pid
in the following format [1234]. Now instead it is 1234:? Where
'?' is actually the role of the instance. M for master, S for slave, C
if this process is a saving child (for RDB/AOF), and X for Sentinel.
\* The default maxmemory policy in Redis 3.0 is no longer "volatile-lru" as
it used to be in 2.8, but "noeviction". The policies behavior is the same
(but LRU eviction is much more precise in 3.0), so only the default value
changed. Just make sure to specify in your redis.conf what you mean.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits: Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Pivotal for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.

Message-ID: <4494606.3KQYZIffxk@chimera>

Subject: Review+CVE request: multiple issues in redis EVAL command (lua sandbox)

Hi,
after earlier disclosure to (antirez) redis author, and upon agreement with him,
I've just reported via github three issues related to the redis EVAL command
and its LUA sandbox.
Those include:
 * sandbox subverting via global environment manipulation
 * crash via assertion hitting (related to the above issue)
 * integer overflow / stack-based buffer overflow in embedded lua_struct.c

I would like to get some review/feedback on those, and (if deemed worthy)
CVEs assigned.
For some background, [0] was the public part of the discussion and [1] a recent
post by upstream author on redis security (his post came just after private
reporting).
[0] <https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3rby8c/a_few_things_about_redis_security/cwnz6qi>
[1] <http://antirez.com/news/96>

For detailed reference, these are the issues reported:

1) Ineffective whitelisting allows for global environment manipulation
   + <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2854>

   Redis lua sandbox is whitelist-based, and some of the exposed functions
   allow for global environment manipulation. This make easier to bypass parts
   of the sandbox (eg. the "strict lua" mode) and to cause other internal
   state de-sync.

2) Reliable remote crash via assertion hitting
   + <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2853>

   Manipulating the lua global environment, it is possible to de-sync lua/redis
   internal state, and reliably trigger a DoS/crash by hitting an assertion.
   Reproducer attached to the bug report.

3) Integer overflow (leading to stack-based buffer overflow) in embedded lua_struct.c
   + <https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/2855>

   Input parsing code in lua_struct.c suffers of Integer Overflow and
   int/size_t confusion, allowing for crafted EVAL command to trigger a stack-based
   buffer overflow with (limited) user-controlled writes.
   Reproducer attached to the bug report.

Ciao, Luca
