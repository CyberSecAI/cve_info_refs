# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: Fwd: Integer overflow in the JasPer's jas_matrix_create() function

The following message didn't make it to the list in time, getting stuck
in a temporary spam folder (so the moderators did not see it until I
just happened to find it in there today).

I've also re-attached the PoC that was attached to the original message.

Apparently, the issue was also reported on December 24 here:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1294039>

The reason for the false spam detection turned out to be the Chinese
gb2312 charset.  We expect only English messages on most Openwall
mailing lists, so the following non-English charsets commonly seen in
spam arriving to our lists are currently treated as spam indicators:

koi8-*
windows-1251
shift_jis
iso-2022-jp
big-5
gb2312

These may or may not trigger spam detection depending on more factors,
which is why some other messages by the same sender made it through.

Unfortunately, this detection may sometimes be triggered on
mostly-English messages that have one of these charsets specified for
the message body (as it was in this case) or the message Subject.

For now, my advice is to avoid using these non-English charsets when
posting to English-only mailing lists.  We might reconsider the
anti-spam settings, although so far they've been reasonably effective
and such misdetection appears rare.

Subject: Integer overflow in the JasPer's jas_matrix_create() function
Date: Thu, 31 Dec 2015 02:05:38 +0000

Hello,
We find a vulnerability in the way JasPer's jas_matrix_create() function parsed certain JPEG 2000 image files.

jas_matrix_t *jas_matrix_create(int numrows, int numcols)
{
	.......

	if (matrix->maxrows_ > 0) {
		if (!(matrix->rows_ = jas_malloc(matrix->maxrows_ *
		  sizeof(jas_seqent_t *)))) {

        ................

matrix->maxrows_ > 0 ,but matrix->maxrows_ *sizeof(jas_seqent_t *) can cause Integer overflow.

Despite this library is used by many programs (<http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/#overview>), there is no one providing support.

This vulnerability was found by Qihoo 360 Codesafe Team

Hi,

Just a quick heads-up: We at Red Hat originally fixed this as part of
the patch for CVE-2008-3520. This was a rather big patch and
closed a lot of potential integer overflows (originally from
OpenBSD?). I imagine a lot of distros used the same patch.

The original description for CVE-2008-3520 is quite general, so I'm
not sure if that's enough to say that CVE-2015-8751 is a dupe or not.
