Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IPMI dissector of Wireshark. It is caused by a malformed packet which triggers an assertion failure in `wmem_alloc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A malformed IPMI packet can cause an assertion failure, leading to a crash.
- The `wmem_alloc` function, related to memory allocation, is involved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the crash of the Wireshark application. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed IPMI packet onto the network.
- **Malicious Trace File:** An attacker can craft a malicious packet trace file that, when opened with Wireshark, triggers the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic or provide a malicious file to a Wireshark user. This could involve being on the same network or using social engineering to trick a user into opening a malformed capture file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- The issue is tracked as issue 11831 in the Wireshark bug tracker.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark version 2.0.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 2.0.1 and later.

In summary, CVE-2015-8739 describes a crash vulnerability in the Wireshark IPMI dissector that can be exploited through malformed network packets or trace files, leading to a denial of service.
