{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the temporary directory handling within the `php_open_temporary_file.c` file. When multiple threads attempt to create and clean up temporary directories concurrently, it leads to memory corruption. Specifically, the patch that was introduced in PHP 5.5.26 changed the tmp directory freeing process from MSHUTDOWN to RSHUTDOWN, which introduced race conditions as the code was not thread-safe.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition, memory corruption, lack of thread safety.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to crashes, memory corruption (zend\_mm\_heap corrupted), and instability in the affected PHP application. In the original report, the Apache web server crashes due to a fault in the php5ts.dll module.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when multiple threads concurrently utilize the affected function within the PHP engine, typically during operations that involve creating temporary files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker does not need a specific position or capability beyond being able to trigger the execution of the affected code. The race condition can occur with normal web requests, especially when the application is generating multiple temporary files in parallel. The ability to cause high load and concurrent request processing is essential in this case."
