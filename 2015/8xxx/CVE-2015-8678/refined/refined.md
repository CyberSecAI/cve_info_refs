The provided document is a security advisory from Huawei regarding Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in the ION and Maxim\_smartpa\_dev drivers of certain Huawei smartphones, and it includes the fix for CVE-2015-8678.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of a DoS vulnerability in the ION driver. The driver is susceptible to crashes due to accessing an invalid memory address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious application installed on the device attempts to access an invalid memory address within the affected driver.
- Specifically, the ION driver is not properly validating or handling memory accesses and this leads to a crash if a malicious application provides an invalid address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, causing the system to crash.
- This can render the affected smartphone temporarily unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious application that needs to be installed on the targeted smartphone.
- The application then exploits the driver vulnerability by attempting to access invalid memory locations

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on their Huawei smartphone.
- Once the app is installed, it can exploit the vulnerability without requiring further user interaction.

**Affected products/versions:**
- Huawei P8 (GRA-TL00C01B220 and earlier versions, GRA-CL00C92B220 and earlier versions, GRA-CL10C92B220 and earlier versions, GRA-UL00C00B220 and earlier versions, GRA-UL10C00B220 and earlier versions)
- Huawei Mate S (CRR-TL00C01B153SP01 and earlier versions, CRR-UL00C00B153 and earlier versions, CRR-CL00C92B153 and earlier versions)

**Fixes:**
- The advisory provides the resolved product and version for each of the affected products.
- Users are advised to apply the system updates for these devices.
