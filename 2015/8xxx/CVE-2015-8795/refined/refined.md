The content is related to CVE-2015-8795.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper validation of user-supplied input when creating fields via the Schema API. This allows for the injection of malicious code through field names, which is then rendered without sanitization in the Admin UI Schema-Browser and Analysis pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials by injecting malicious JavaScript. This can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker creates a malicious field name using the Schema API. When a user accesses the Schema-Browser or Analysis pages, the malicious JavaScript embedded in the field name is executed within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create fields using the Schema API (e.g., having appropriate permissions to manipulate the Solr schema). The attacker also needs to lure a victim into visiting the affected Admin UI pages.
