| [Description](#c0)  Mike Williams    2004-05-31 08:08:13 UTC  ``` In a small moment of forgetfulness I forgot to compile ext2 support into my kernel when switching from manual compilation to using genkernel. I don't use ext2, so only had it as a module. Naturally that kernel was broken, as it couldn't mount the ext2 initrd.  No doubt more people will do similar, and have done in the past. So if people want to use the initrd, ext2 is very much a required feature, lets turn it on if off.  sauron genkernel # diff -u gen_configkernel.sh.orig gen_configkernel.sh --- gen_configkernel.sh.orig    2004-05-31 15:12:16.572117703 +0100 +++ gen_configkernel.sh 2004-05-31 15:28:33.380547637 +0100 @@ -82,4 +82,10 @@                 [ "$?" != "0" ] && gen_die "Error: xconfig failed."         fi  +       EXT2CFG=`egrep "CONFIG_EXT2_FS=m|CONFIG_EXT2_FS is not set" .config` +       if [ "${EXT2CFG}" != "" ] +       then +               sed -i .config -e "s/${EXT2CFG}/CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y/" +       fi +  }  Perhaps a configuration option could be added to optionally skip this.

If you could tweak that patch and attach a new one I'd be happy to add it into the next release.  Thanks! ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mike Williams    2004-05-31 08:53:07 UTC  ``` Thanks for the quick feedback!  I used an egrep to count for the possibility of ext2 support being turned off alltogether. Your example wouldn't work there, as the sed wouldn't find 'CONFIG_EXT2_FS=.+'. Plus in my 2.6.5 kernel config there are 2 lines matching 'CONFIG_EXT2_FS', hence the belt and braces approach. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-31 09:12:39 UTC  ``` Good point, but it can still be done with a simple sed:  $ cat tempConfig CONFIG_EXT2_FS=m CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y # CONFIG_EXT2_FS is not set  CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO=m CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO=y # CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO is not set  $ grep 'CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y' tempConfig CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y  $ sed tempConfig -e 's/#\? \?CONFIG_EXT2_FS[ =].*/CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y/g' CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y  CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO=m CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO=y # CONFIG_EXT2_FS_MOO is not set ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mike Williams    2004-05-31 09:25:14 UTC  ``` Oh, sed god :) I see what it's doing, but don't really understand how the '#\? \?' bit work.  Anyway, updated patch.  --- gen_configkernel.sh.orig    2004-05-31 15:12:16.000000000 +0100 +++ gen_configkernel.sh 2004-05-31 17:24:08.649960120 +0100 @@ -82,4 +82,7 @@                 [ "$?" != "0" ] && gen_die "Error: xconfig failed."         fi  +       # Make sure EXT2 support is turned on. +       sed -i .config -e 's/#\? \?CONFIG_EXT2_FS[ =].*/CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y/g' +  }  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-31 09:37:32 UTC  ``` \? = a GNU sed extension for "match previous character once, or no times".  Therefore, "#\? \?Moo" will match "Moo", " Moo", "#Moo" and "# Moo" which suits us fine just incase the .config is not in the best shape somehow.  One could also do 's/^\(# \)\?CONFIG_EXT2_FS[ =].*/CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y/g' which will only match 'CONFIG_'... and '# CONFIG...' but that incurs the penalty of having to store '# ' in a buffer and then not even use it... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-07-28 03:59:29 UTC  ``` The patch should be in Portage with genkernel-3.0.2e; please reopen this bug if you have any issues with it. Thanks! ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Joël    2004-09-15 04:28:20 UTC  ``` I use a cramfs initrd; so ext2 is not needed for me.  Is it possible to add a command-line switch, to prevent forcing ext2 for those who don't want it ?  Or (the better solution?) -- give the choice between a ext2 or cramfs initrd ? I think displaying a warning if the user forgets ext2 is fine, but forcing ext2 for everyone without notice is not too good (imho).  Btw I have a script which turns genkernel's ext2 initrd into a cramfs. I'll sure provide it if someone is interested ! ``` |  |

[...]

Note that two of the bounds checks added in that commit are incorrect:

1. In conv_jistoeuc() the check uses > rather than <, which causes all
   conversions to return an empty string.  This is presumably not a
   security issue, but is a regression.

3. In conv_euctojis() the comparison is with outlen - 3, but each pass
   through the loop uses up to 5 bytes and the rest of the function may
   add another 4 bytes.  The comparison should presumably be
   '<= outlen - 9' or equivalently '< outlen - 8'.

The first check is fixed by a later commit:
<http://git.claws-mail.org/?p=claws.git;a=commitdiff;h=e3ffcb455e0376053451ce968e6c71ef37708222>
