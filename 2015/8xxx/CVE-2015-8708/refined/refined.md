Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8708:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201606-11) explicitly lists CVE-2015-8708 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting `mail-client/claws-mail`.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is not described in detail. However, the advisory and the associated mailing list entry reveal that there are multiple vulnerabilities in claws-mail, with a specific focus on issues related to character set conversion in `codeconv.c` specifically `conv_jistoeuc`, `conv_euctojis` and `conv_sjistoeuc`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Stack buffer overflow** due to lack of bounds checking in the `conv_jistoeuc()`, `conv_euctojis()` and `conv_sjistoeuc()` functions when converting between character sets.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker could potentially achieve code execution through stack buffer overflow by providing crafted input to the vulnerable functions.
   - An attacker could possibly intercept communications due to the default implementation of SSL 3.0.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is through processing of crafted text data that is processed by claws-mail using the vulnerable character set conversion functions.
   - A remote attacker could exploit the SSL 3.0 vulnerability to intercept communications.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - An attacker would need to be able to send specially crafted emails or other text data that would be processed by the vulnerable claws-mail code.
   - For the SSL 3.0 vulnerability, the attacker would need to be positioned to intercept network traffic.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The mailing list entry highlights that the initial patch for the `conv_jistoeuc()` had a bug that caused the conversion to return empty strings and the patch for `conv_euctojis()` has an incorrect bounds check, indicating the initial fix was not fully correct.
*   The Gentoo bug report #52558 is related to requiring ext2 support for initrd, which is unrelated to CVE-2015-8708.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201606-11) confirms that the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely and are related to multiple vulnerabilities including the issues mentioned in the mailing list entries and a different SSL implementation vulnerability.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201606-11) also mentions the fix is in version 3.13.2 of claws-mail

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8708 in claws-mail is due to lack of bounds checking in character set conversion functions leading to potential stack buffer overflows. The issue can be exploited remotely. The fix is in version 3.13.2 of claws-mail.
