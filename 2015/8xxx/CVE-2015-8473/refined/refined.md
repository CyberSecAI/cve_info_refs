{
  "CVE-2015-8473": {
    "description": "The Redmine issue API may disclose changeset messages that are not visible to a user due to insufficient permission checks on the project level, potentially leading to an information leak.",
    "root_cause": "The issue API was not properly checking user permissions against the project associated with a changeset, instead of the project of the issue itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Users may be able to view changeset messages from projects they do not have access to.",
    "attack_vectors": "By using the issue API and requesting to include changesets in the response, an attacker can potentially access changeset messages from other projects, even if they lack direct access to them.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a Redmine user with access to the issue API and have knowledge of a project and issue to send the API request."
