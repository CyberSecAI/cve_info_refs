Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The JSESSIONID cookie served by the Puppet Enterprise (PE) console did not have the `Secure` flag set.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The absence of the `Secure` flag on the JSESSIONID cookie meant that the cookie could be sent over an insecure HTTP connection, even though the PE console primarily uses HTTPS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by intercepting the JSESSIONID cookie if it is sent over HTTP. This could lead to unauthorized access to the PE console.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker could induce a user to connect to the PE console over an insecure HTTP connection, which could be done via a man-in-the-middle attack or by directing the user to an HTTP URL for the PE console.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the PE console or trick the user into accessing the PE console through HTTP.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Puppet Enterprise versions 3.7.x, 3.8.x, and 2015.2.x.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in Puppet Enterprise version 2015.3.0, where the JSESSIONID cookie is set with the `Secure` flag by default.
