Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the relevant content regarding CVE-2015-8138:

**Content Overview:**

The provided documents from various sources (NetApp, Cisco, Red Hat, Gentoo, SUSE, CERT, and openSUSE) all discuss CVE-2015-8138, which relates to a vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd). The core issue stems from a missing check for a zero originate timestamp when ntpd is acting as a client.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The ntpd client doesn't properly validate the originate timestamp in received packets, specifically failing to check for zero-value timestamps.
*   **Weakness:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20), specifically a missing check for a zero value for the originate timestamp in received packets.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted NTP packets to a vulnerable ntpd client.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target ntpd client and must know a valid peer address.  No authentication is needed for the basic attack, but authentication might be bypassed using this vulnerability.  Off-path attacks are possible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can send a crafted packet, which is accepted by the client due to the lack of proper checks, effectively disabling the client's time synchronization with legitimate servers. The client will reject future legitimate server responses.
    *   **Time Modification:** An attacker can inject arbitrary offset/delay measurements, manipulating the client's time and taking control over the systemâ€™s clock. The attacker can cause ntpd to exit with an offset larger than the panic threshold, resulting in denial of service.
*   **Affected Components:** The core vulnerability lies in the `ntpd` client's handling of NTP packets, specifically in the validation of the originate timestamp in version before ntp-4.2.8p6.

**Additional Details From Content:**

*   **NetApp:** Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode is affected by CVE-2015-8138. It recommends implementing authentication to protect against this vulnerability.
*   **Cisco:**  Multiple Cisco products that incorporate the vulnerable version of ntpd are affected.
*   **Red Hat:**  Versions of NTP shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are not affected as they do not include the affected code. A patch is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, which addresses the vulnerability using an updated patch.
*   **Gentoo:** The vulnerability affects `net-misc/ntp` packages before version 4.2.8\_p8.
*   **SUSE:**  Lists several affected products including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Desktop, and others.  Suggests an upgrade to NTP 4.2.8p8 for remediation. Also indicates a fix in yast2-ntp-client.
*   **CERT:** The vulnerability is described as a "Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass".  NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 are vulnerable.
*   **openSUSE:**  Confirms the vulnerability is resolved in the provided fixes.

**CVE-2015-8138 CVSSv3 Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a slight impact on data integrity, but no impact on confidentiality and availability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8138 is a medium-severity vulnerability arising from a flaw in ntpd's handling of zero-value origin timestamps. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disrupt time synchronization or, potentially, to manipulate the time on affected systems.  The missing validation provides an avenue for time synchronization manipulation, which can be used for subsequent attacks that rely on time-related features of a host.

The provided content gives a fairly good description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.  Remediation involves updating the vulnerable ntpd packages to a version that has the fix.
