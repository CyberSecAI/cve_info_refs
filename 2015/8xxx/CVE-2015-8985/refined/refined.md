Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8985:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `pop_fail_stack()` function in glibc's regular expression processing code.
- An assertion failure occurs due to an invalid negative value, specifically `Assertion 'num >= 0' failed`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Assertion failure in `pop_fail_stack()`.
- The bug is triggered by crafting a specific invalid regular expression that results in the assertion failure.
- This is a software defect leading to an unexpected program termination.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) is the primary impact.
- The assertion failure causes the application to abort/crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted invalid regular expression to an application that uses the vulnerable glibc function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence the regular expressions used by the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using American fuzzy lop (AFL).
- The bug report mentions a test program which demonstrates the assertion failure.
- The issue was fixed in glibc version 2.28-0experimental0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `regexec.c` file of the glibc library.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201908-06) also references CVE-2015-8985 along with other glibc vulnerabilities.
