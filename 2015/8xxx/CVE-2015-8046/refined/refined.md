      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. This could also lead to a crash or denial of service (DoS)",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a specially crafted SWF file that contains the malicious antiAliasType setter.  This is done by having a website load the malicious SWF file in an Adobe Flash Player instance.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted SWF file and entice a user to load it within Adobe Flash Player.",
