- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The bozohttpd web server allows the execution of arbitrary programs as CGI handlers, including those not designed to be used as such. It passes all arguments from the remote client to the executed binary, which can lead to the exploitation of program features and modification of their behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of arguments passed to CGI handlers.  Specifically, the vulnerability arises when non-CGI aware programs (such as `sh` or the CLI version of PHP) are used as CGI handlers.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Remote code execution as the httpd user. An attacker can craft malicious requests that, when passed as arguments to a vulnerable CGI handler, allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending specially crafted HTTP requests, an attacker can control the arguments passed to CGI handlers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable bozohttpd server. They don't need prior access or credentials, making this a remote vulnerability.
