  "CVE-2015-8639": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the MovieClip object. By calling the hitTest method of a MovieClip object, an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the MovieClip object when calling the hitTest method.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability with user interaction. The attacker needs to control a malicious page or a file."
