Nobody has commented on this, so we'll conclude that "successful
decryption of such a message is used as an authentication mechanism"
is a plausible use case, and assign a CVE ID: CVE-2015-8013.

As far as we know, the scenario might be something like:

  if a user symmetrically encrypts a message of "hello" with the
  hard-to-guess passphrase of secret0, then an automated process
  grants them access to uid 0

  if a user symmetrically encrypts a message of "hello" with the
  hard-to-guess passphrase of secret1, then an automated process
  grants them access to uid 1

  etc.

Although there is a communication channel from the user to the
automated process, there is no way for the user to send a helpful hint
about what passphrase should be tried. The automated process only
tries its own set of hard-coded passphrases. For this reason, it is a
vulnerability if a user is able to construct (intentionally) a
properly formatted message that seems to be encrypted in a useful
way, but actually isn't encrypted in a useful way.

This vulnerability (unlike the
<https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/wiki/Cure53-security-audit>
vulnerabilities) is not yet referenced from the
<https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/master/README.md> page.
