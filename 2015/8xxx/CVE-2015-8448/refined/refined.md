Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2015-8448 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the `DisplacementMapFilter` object in Adobe Flash Player. Specifically, the issue arises when manipulating the `mapBitmap` property of a `DisplacementMapFilter` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** A pointer to a memory location is used after the memory has been freed. This can lead to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, taking control of the affected system.
- Other potential impacts (from Gentoo advisory, though not directly specified for this CVE): Denial of Service (DoS), obtaining sensitive information, or bypassing security restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required. Specifically, the target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that contains the specially crafted Flash content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or host a malicious SWF file. They also need to lure a victim into interacting with this file.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `mapBitmap` property of the `DisplacementMapFilter` object. This manipulation causes a dangling pointer to be reused after the memory it pointed to was freed.

**Affected Software:**
- Adobe Flash Player versions prior to 18.0.0.268, 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.554 on Linux.
- Adobe AIR versions prior to 20.0.0.204
- Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204
- Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by updating to the specified or a later version of Adobe Flash Player.

**CVE Details Compared to Content:**
- The provided content offers more specific technical details than the CVE description, namely regarding the manipulation of the `mapBitmap` property and the use-after-free condition of the `DisplacementMapFilter` object in ActionScript 2 (AS2).
