Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8560:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `foomatic-rip` print filter within `cups-filters` and `foomatic-filters` did not properly sanitize input. Specifically, it failed to treat the semicolon (`;`) character as a shell escape character.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The filter did not adequately strip or escape shell metacharacters from user-controlled input before using it to construct command-line arguments passed to external programs.
*   **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization allowed attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands into the command line executed by the print filter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the `lp` user (typically the user that handles print jobs). This would allow for complete system compromise depending on the capabilities of the targeted system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can gain elevated privileges (the `lp` user is not meant to be directly controlled).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending a specially crafted print job to a vulnerable system.
*   **Print Job Manipulation:** Attackers can craft a malicious print job that includes shell metacharacters such as a semicolon to inject their own commands into the printing process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable printing service.
*   **Print Job Submission:** The attacker must be able to submit print jobs to the vulnerable system, likely over the network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the system is running a vulnerable version of the `foomatic-rip` filter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding the semicolon to the list of shell escape characters to be stripped from the inputs.
*   Several Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, issued security updates to address this vulnerability.
*   This CVE is related to CVE-2015-8327 which had similar issues related to backticks.
*   The fix was implemented in cups-filters version 1.4.0 and foomatic-filters version 4.0.17.
