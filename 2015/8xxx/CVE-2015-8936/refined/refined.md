Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8936 (inferred from the subject line of the emails)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in `squidGuard.cgi`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `squidGuard.cgi` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `$url` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Phishing attacks
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `$url` parameter in the `squidGuard.cgi` script.
- This is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected through the URL and reflected back to the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and entice a victim to click on it. This can be done through social engineering, malicious links on a website, or other methods.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have direct access to the `squidGuard` server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing tags in the `$url` variable, likely with escaping or filtering.
- The patch notes suggest a fix was implemented in `squidGuard.cgi` on 2015-02-01.
- The patch provided replaces tags in the URL.
