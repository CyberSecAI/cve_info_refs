Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8539:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content consistently refers to CVE-2015-8539 with the same description: "The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (BUG) via crafted keyctl commands that negatively instantiate a key, related to security/keys/encrypted-keys/encrypted.c, security/keys/trusted.c, and security/keys/user_defined.c (bnc#958463)."
This matches the description in the provided security advisory excerpts, confirming its relevance to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's KEYS subsystem. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the kernel handles user keys that are negatively instantiated. When a user key is negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the payload area. The kernel fails to properly account for this cached error code when these negatively instantiated keys are later updated or handled, specifically in the `encrypted.c`, `trusted.c`, and `user_defined.c` files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The core weakness is the lack of proper checks for cached error codes in the payload area of negatively instantiated user keys. Specifically, functions like `encrypted_update`, `trusted_update` and `user_update` (key type method) don't account for the fact that there might be a cached error code, which causes a NULL pointer dereference when the key is updated.
*   **Use-after-free:**  When updating a negatively instantiated key with valid data, if the ->update method doesn't account for the error code, it can lead to use-after-free or null pointer dereferences, which can crash the system.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can potentially allow a local user to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service (system crash or BUG). The system crashes due to a NULL pointer dereference.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have a user account on the target system.
*   **Crafted Keyctl Commands:** The exploit involves crafting specific `keyctl` commands to negatively instantiate a user key and then try to positively instantiate it.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Linux system.
*   **keyctl Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute `keyctl` commands.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to craft specific `keyctl` commands that trigger the flaw.

**Additional Information (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   **Specific files:** The vulnerability is located in files `security/keys/encrypted-keys/encrypted.c`, `security/keys/trusted.c`, and `security/keys/user_defined.c` within the Linux kernel source tree.
*   **Trigger conditions:** The flaw can be triggered by using the command sequence `keyctl request2 user user "" @U; keyctl add user user "a" @U`, or `keyctl request2 trusted user "" @U; keyctl add trusted user "a" @U`.
