{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ARM64 architecture's dma_alloc_coherent() function did not consistently zero allocated buffers, unlike other architectures. Some drivers and user-space applications relied on this zeroing behavior, and not performing this zeroing could lead to the exposure of random kernel memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent memory initialization",
      "Exposure of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of random kernel memory to user space, potentially leading to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "DMA buffer allocation",
       "dma_mmap() calls exposing memory to user-space"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to allocate DMA-coherent memory and map it into user space. In the context of the provided information it means, a malicious application can make use of the dma_mmap() call.",
    "additional_info": "The patch unifies the behavior of dma_alloc_coherent() on ARM64 with other architectures by unconditionally zeroing the allocated buffer. This ensures that sensitive kernel memory is not leaked when the buffer is exposed to user space."
