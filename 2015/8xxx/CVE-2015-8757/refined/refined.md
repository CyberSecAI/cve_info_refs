- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly HTML encode extension data during an extension installation process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject malicious code through extension data during the installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to install an extension with malicious content. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
