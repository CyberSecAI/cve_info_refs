Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8375:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize the content of the `robots.txt` file within the PHP-Fusion administration panel.
*   Specifically, the `robots.txt` editor loads the file content directly into a `<textarea>` element without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `robots.txt` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers when they view the editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with access to only the robots.txt editor can exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges within the application.
*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** The attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server through the execution of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** It is possible to gain a reverse TCP shell on the server, indicating a path to remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the administration interface of PHP-Fusion.
*   An attacker with access to the robots.txt editor is required.
*   The attacker injects malicious code into the `robots.txt` file.
*   When an administrator (or another user) views or edits the file in the admin panel, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account with access to the robots.txt editor. This is likely a low-privilege user role in the CMS.
*   No specific technical skills are needed to exploit this vulnerability other than knowledge of basic HTML/JS injection.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided resources mention a fix being implemented in this commit: <https://github.com/php-fusion/PHP-Fusion/commit/f1a5fce791e2392d5a23a6d62ab65c481cdd6a66>
* The vulnerability is described as "XSS to RCE" indicating that the XSS can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
