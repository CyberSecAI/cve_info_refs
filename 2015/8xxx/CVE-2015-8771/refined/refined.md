Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-provided passwords when generating Samba NT/LM hashes in GOsa (Gonicus Open Services Appliance). Specifically, the password was passed to a Perl script via a command-line parameter without proper sanitization, which could lead to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `sambaHashHook` setting in GOsa, which defines a command to generate Samba hashes, was susceptible to command injection. The password was inserted into the command string using `preg_replace` and `escapeshellarg`, but this was insufficient to prevent injection if a malicious password contained backticks, for example.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The initial attempt to escape special characters using `addcslashes` was not effective at preventing injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A malicious user could craft a password containing shell metacharacters, which would then be executed by the system when the `sambaHashHook` command is run by the GOsa application. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Password Field:** A user would need to set a specially crafted password via the GOsa interface or API. The malicious payload would be part of the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to change their password, or a user whose password is being changed by an administrator via a vulnerable function.
- **Knowledge of Injection Point:** While not explicitly required, knowledge of the vulnerable parameter or `sambaHashHook` may assist in creating the exploit.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by base64 encoding the password before passing it as a parameter to the perl script, and decoding it within the perl script.
- The fix commit message states "command line parameter will be passed base64 encoded to avoid complex escaping sequences that may alter the initial passphrase".

**Additional Details:**
- The original commit used `escapeshellarg()` which is not sufficient to prevent code injection, as highlighted by the vulnerability.
- The fix involved not only encoding, but also modifying the perl script to decode the base64 parameter.
- The vulnerable code was in `include/functions.inc` and the fix was implemented in `include/class_core.inc` and `include/functions.inc`.
