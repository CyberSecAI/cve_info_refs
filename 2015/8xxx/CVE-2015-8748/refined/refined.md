Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user input when used in regular expressions within the rights management component of Radicale. Specifically, an attacker could provide a specially crafted username containing regex metacharacters, such as `.*`, which would then be used in a regular expression that determines access rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Regex Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a regex injection flaw, where unsanitized user-provided strings are incorporated into regular expressions.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system failed to escape or sanitize user names before using them in a regex context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Access Controls:** An attacker with a crafted username could bypass the intended access control mechanisms, specifically `owner_write` and `owner_only`.
    *   `owner_write` is intended to allow everyone to read a calendar but only the owner to write.
    *   `owner_only` is intended to restrict all access to the owner.
*   **Unauthorized Read/Write Access:** By bypassing these rules, an attacker could gain read access to calendars they should not be able to access, and gain write access to calendars that should be limited to read-only.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication:** The attack vector is through the authentication process. An attacker needs to create or use an account with a specially crafted username.
*   **Username Injection:** The specific crafted input is within the username field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Authenticate:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the Radicale server.
*   **Crafted Username:**  The attacker needs to be able to set a username containing regex metacharacters.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `radicale/rights/regex.py`.
*   The fix involves escaping the user name and collection URL using `re.escape()` before including them in the regular expression. The commit `4bfe7c9f7991d534c8b9fbe153af9d341f925f98` introduces this fix:
    ```
    user_escaped = re.escape(user)
    collection_url_escaped = re.escape(collection_url)
    regex = ConfigParser({"login": user_escaped, "path": collection_url_escaped})
    ```
