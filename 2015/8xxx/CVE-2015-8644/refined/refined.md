  "CVE-2015-8644": {
    "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.324 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.267 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.559 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.233, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.233, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.233 allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging an unspecified \"type confusion.\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Type confusion in the SimpleButton constructor within Adobe Flash Player.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Type confusion vulnerability occurs when an empty button object is created using a SWF tag before it's created in the Button class, and it is not of type Button. Flash stores an empty button to use for optimization. This discrepancy allows the type of an object to be confused with the type of a button."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious SWF file. The attacker needs to modify the SWF binary using a hex editor.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the SWF file in a hex editor to change font ID references to the ID of the empty button object. The attacker then needs to have the victim load the altered SWF file."
