- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection within the `com_templates` component of Joomla! CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing or inadequate CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially modify templates or perform other administrative actions within the Joomla! CMS through a CSRF attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is performed via a CSRF attack, which usually involves a malicious link or website that triggers actions in the target application while the user is logged in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link.
