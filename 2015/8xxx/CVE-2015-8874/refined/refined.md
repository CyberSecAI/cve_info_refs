{
  "CVE-2015-8874": {
    "Description": "Stack consumption vulnerability in GD in PHP before 5.6.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted imagefilltoborder call.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a recursive algorithm within the imagefilltoborder function, which can lead to a stack overflow if a very large negative coordinate is passed or when dealing with very large images.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Recursive algorithm in imagefilltoborder without proper input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to stack exhaustion",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted imagefilltoborder call with large negative coordinates",
      "Use of imagefilltoborder on very large images"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to pass crafted parameters to the `imagefilltoborder` function, either through direct calls or by manipulating image processing routines that use this function.",
    "Additional Details": "The issue lies in the GD library used by PHP. While the recursive algorithm contributes to the issue, the primary problem is the lack of proper coordinate clipping within the function. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing very large negative coordinates to `imagefilltoborder`, or by using the function on extremely large images, leading to a crash due to stack exhaustion. The patch addresses this by implementing proper clipping of coordinates."

  "CVE-2015-8873": {
    "Description": "Stack consumption vulnerability in Zend/zend_exceptions.c in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via recursive method calls.",
     "Root cause": "A vulnerability related to recursive method calls handling was found in php. The number of nested calls a method could perform to itself doesn't seem to be limited.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted recursive method calls",
      "Lack of stack exhaustion protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to stack exhaustion leading to a segmentation fault.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted code to cause infinite recursion",
      "Deserialization of untrusted input leading to recursive method calls"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute PHP code or to provide untrusted serialized input to the PHP engine.",
     "Additional Details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted code or by deserialization of untrusted input. The recursive method calls lead to an infinite loop that results in invalid memory read access due to stack exhaustion, resulting in a segmentation fault. It's important to note that there is no plan to backport the fix to PHP packages in Red Hat products."
