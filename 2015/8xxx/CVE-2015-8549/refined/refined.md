Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8549:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of AMF input payloads within the PyAMF library. Specifically, the XML parser used by PyAMF did not prevent the processing of XML external entities (XXE).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. This allows an attacker to include malicious XML external entities within an AMF payload.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious payload could trigger a DoS condition by forcing the XML parser to consume excessive resources.
*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract the contents of files accessible by the running application due to the XXE vulnerability. This means an attacker could read files on the server's filesystem, gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted AMF Payload:** The attack vector involves creating a malicious AMF payload that contains references to XML external entities. This payload would be sent to a server using PyAMF for processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send an AMF payload to an application using the vulnerable version of PyAMF. This could be achieved by controlling the input provided to a vulnerable service.
*  The attacker does not need specific privileges but requires to be able to communicate with the service.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by wrapping all calls to `etree.fromstring()` with `defusedxml`, which prevents the processing of external entities by default.
*  The vulnerable versions are PyAMF <= 0.7.2, the fix is included in PyAMF >= 0.8.0
