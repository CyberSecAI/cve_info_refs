[PyAMF](http://www.pyamf.org) provides Action Message Format ([AMF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format)) support for [Python](http://python.org) that is
compatible with the [Adobe Flash Player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Player). It includes integration with
Python web frameworks like [Django](http://djangoproject.com), [Pylons](http://pylonshq.com), [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com), [SQLAlchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org),
[web2py](http://www.web2py.com) and [more](http://pyamf.org/tutorials/index.html).

The [Adobe Integrated Runtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR) and [Adobe Flash Player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Player) use AMF to
communicate between an application and a remote server. AMF encodes
remote procedure calls (RPC) into a compact binary representation that
can be transferred over HTTP/HTTPS or the [RTMP/RTMPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol) protocol.
Objects and data values are serialized into this binary format, which
increases performance, allowing applications to load data up to 10 times
faster than with text-based formats such as XML or SOAP.

AMF3, the default serialization for [ActionScript](http://dev.pyamf.org/wiki/ActionScript) 3.0, provides various
advantages over AMF0, which is used for ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. AMF3
sends data over the network more efficiently than AMF0. AMF3 supports
sending `int` and `uint` objects as integers and supports data types
that are available only in ActionScript 3.0, such as [ByteArray](http://dev.pyamf.org/wiki/ByteArray),
[ArrayCollection](http://dev.pyamf.org/wiki/ArrayCollection), [ObjectProxy](http://dev.pyamf.org/wiki/ObjectProxy) and [IExternalizable](http://dev.pyamf.org/wiki/IExternalizable).

### @njoyce **[njoyce](/njoyce)** commented [Dec 9, 2015](#issue-121205802)

By default, PyAMF will not support potentially vulnerable XML payloads. See

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML\_External\_Entity\_(XXE)\_Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing).

Wrap all calls to `etree.fromstring()` with `defusedxml`. All the standard XML processing libs that PyAMF previously supported are still supported.

There may be people who use DTD/Entities as part of their AMF payloads - they will have

to continue to use an old version or make an issue to see how their use case can still be

supported.

Sorry, something went wrong.

**oCERT-2015-011 PyAMF input sanitization errors (XXE)**

**Description**:

[PyAMF](https://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf/) is a Python
module that implements the Action Message Format (AMF) protocol,
allowing Flash interoperation with various web frameworks.

PyAMF suffers from insufficient AMF input payload sanitization which
results in the XML parser not preventing the processing of XML external
entities (XXE).

A specially crafted AMF payload, containing malicious references to
XML external entities, can be used to trigger Denial of Service (DoS)
conditions or arbitrarily return the contents of files that are
accessible with the running application privileges.

**Affected version**:

[PyAMF](https://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf) <= 0.7.2

**Fixed version**:

[PyAMF](https://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf) >= 0.8.0

**Credit**: vulnerability reported by Nicolas Grégoire <nicolas [dot] gregoire [at] agarri [dot] fr>.

**CVE**: [CVE-2015-8549](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8549)

**Timeline**:

2015-12-01: vulnerability report received

2015-12-02: contacted maintainer

2015-12-04: maintainer commits patch via public pull request

2015-12-12: reporter confirms patch

2015-12-14: contacted affected vendors

2015-12-14: assigned CVE

2015-12-17: advisory release
