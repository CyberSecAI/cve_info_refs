- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system displays the password in plain text when a user enters it to upload files to a specific directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure, specifically of passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the password used to upload files, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access; an attacker needs to be able to see the user inputting the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be physically present or have visual access to the user's screen when the password is being entered during file upload.
