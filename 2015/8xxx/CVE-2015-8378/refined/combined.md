Dear Maintainer,

*** Reporter, please consider answering these questions, where appropriate ***

   * What led up to the situation?
Klick on file/export_to/KeepassX XML-File
   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?
Test and check the functions on keepass. This will be save an invisivle .xml
file in your home directory.
   * What was the outcome of this action?
The Passwortlist is accessible in plaintext

   * What outcome did you expect instead?
This effekt is also in my arch / manjaro-linux-package of keepassx

Thanks for help Hopefully! :-)

thanks

How come this bug has not been marked as a pretty severe security issue?

Just accessing a menu item, but canceling the export operation by
hitting Esc or clicking Cancel silently creates a hidden (dotfile)
cleartext copy of all of the user's KeePassX password database entries
in the user's home directory. This may go unnoticed by the user for
years, while countless copies of the file propagate to backups etc.,
and with Debian's default umask, the file is even world-readable in
multiuser machines.

```

This issue seems to only affect export to XML. Export to text file
defaults to "All Files" in the file selection dialog, where XML
defaults to *.xml. Otherwise the source code looks pretty similar for
both:

Export_KeePassX_Xml.cpp:

bool Export_KeePassX_Xml::exportDatabase(QWidget* GuiParent,IDatabase* database){
        db=database;
        QFile *file=openFile(GuiParent,identifier(),QStringList()<<tr("XML Files (*.xml)") << tr("All Files (*)"));
        if(!file)return false;

Export_Txt.cpp:

bool Export_Txt::exportDatabase(QWidget* GuiParent, IDatabase* db){
        QFile *file=openFile(GuiParent,identifier(),QStringList()<<tr("All Files (*)") << tr("Text Files (*.txt)"));
        if(!file)return false;

Unfortunately I don't have the Qt skills to debug this further.

```
