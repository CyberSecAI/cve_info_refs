  "vulnerability": "Open URL Redirection",
  "root_cause": "The Hue application had a URL redirection issue on its login page due to insufficient validation of the 'next' GET parameter.",
  "weakness": "The application failed to properly sanitize the 'next' parameter, allowing for schemaless URLs (e.g., //github.com) to bypass the existing whitelist.",
  "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a phishing attack, where a victim user is redirected to a malicious site after authentication.",
  "attack_details": "An attacker could craft a URL containing a malicious site in the 'next' parameter and send it to a victim. After the victim successfully logs in, they are redirected to the attacker-controlled site.",
  "affected_versions": "Cloudera HUE before 3.10.0",
  "fix": "The regex used to validate the 'next' parameter was tightened to prevent schemaless URLs."
