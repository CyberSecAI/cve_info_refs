Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8538

**Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `dwarf_leb.c` file of the libdwarf library. This occurs when processing a malformed or corrupt DWARF (Debugging with Attributed Record Formats) abbreviation entry within an ELF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability stems from the library attempting to read memory beyond the allocated buffer or boundary when decoding a variable-length encoded number (LEB128 format) within the DWARF debugging information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) and crash of the application using the libdwarf library, such as the `dwarfdump` utility, when processing crafted ELF files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ELF files:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious ELF file containing a specially crafted DWARF debugging section that includes a corrupt abbreviation entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted ELF file to an application that uses the vulnerable libdwarf library. This could involve:
    *   Persuading a user to open a malicious ELF file with a tool that uses libdwarf (like dwarfdump).
    *   Exploiting a vulnerable service that processes ELF files server-side and uses libdwarf.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially identified when the dwarfdump tool crashed after processing a malformed DWARF entry.
*   The bug report (1289385) indicates the issue was initially found in Rawhide, which is a development version of Fedora Linux.
*   Red Hat bug report 1291299 is an umbrella bug to track the vulnerability and its fix in several Red Hat products, not just Fedora.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a corrupt abbreviation entry when decoding a LEB128 number.
*   The issue has been closed as "WONTFIX" in the main Red Hat bug, implying that the issue was fixed upstream and no action was needed on the part of the Red Hat Security Response team for this specific issue.
*   The issue was also tracked with bug report 1291300, specifically concerning epel-6.
