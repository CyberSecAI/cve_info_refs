```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `connectionId` parameter in the `FileUploadServlet` class is not properly sanitized, allowing path traversal and null byte injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Unsanitized user-supplied input (`connectionId`).
    - Path traversal vulnerability.
    - Null byte injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary file upload.
    - Remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.
- Attack vectors:
    - Sending a crafted POST request to the `fileupload` endpoint with a malicious `connectionId` parameter, which includes path traversal sequences and a null byte.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Network access to the vulnerable ManageEngine Desktop Central server.
    - Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
