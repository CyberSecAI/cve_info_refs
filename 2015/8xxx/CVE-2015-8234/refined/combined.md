### Bug Description

This have been reported by Daniel P. Berrange:

"

In the OpenStack Liberty release, the Glance project added support for image signature verification.

<http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/liberty/image-signing-and-verification-support.html>

The verification code was added in the following git commit

<https://github.com/openstack/glance/commit/484ef1b40b738c87adb203bba6107ddb4b04ff6e>

Unfortunately the design of this signature verification method is flawed by design.

The generalized approach to creating signatures of content is to apply a hash to the content and then encrypt it in some manner. Consider that the signature is defined to use hash=sha256 and cipher=rsa we can describe the signature computation as

signature = rsa(sha256(content))

In the case of verifying a disk image, the content we care about verifying is the complete disk image file. Unfortunately, the glance specification chose \*not\* to compute the signature against the disk image file. Glance already had an MD5 checksum calculated for the disk image file, so they instead chose to compute the signature against the MD5 checksum instead. ie glance is running

signature = rsa(sha256(md5(disk-image-content)))

This degrades the security of the system to that of the weakest hash, which is obviously MD5 here.

The code where glance verifies the signature is in the glance/locations.py, the 'set\_data' method where is does

result = signature\_utils.verify\_signature(

 self.context, checksum, self.image.extra\_properties)

 if result:

 LOG.info(\_LI("Successfully verified signature for image %s"),

 self.image.image\_id)

The 'checksum' variable is populate by the glance\_store driver, but it is hardcoded to always be md5 in all current glance storage backends:

$ git grep hashlib glance\_store/\_drivers/ | grep checksum

 glance\_store/\_drivers/filesystem.py: checksum = hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/rbd.py: checksum = hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/s3.py: checksum = hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/s3.py: checksum = hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/sheepdog.py: checksum = hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/swift/store.py: checksum =

 hashlib.md5()

 glance\_store/\_drivers/vmware\_datastore.py: self.checksum =

 hashlib.md5()

Since we will soon be shipping OpenStack Liberty release, we need to at least give a security notice to alert our customers to the fact that the signature verification is cryptographically weak/broken. IMHO, it quite likely deserves a CVE though

NB, this is public knowledge as I first became aware of this flawed design in comments / discussion on a public specification proposed to implement the same approach in the Nova project.

My suggested way to fix this is to simply abandon the current impl and re-do it such that it directly computes the signature against the disk image, and does not use the existing md5 checksum in any way.

Regards,

Daniel

The flaw sounds legit, however the attack surface is a bit shallow:

IIUC the image signature verifies image read from a malicious backend.

End user of Glance are not really affected since they will requests the API either an image name or UUID, which are not protected by signature mechanisms afaik.

Thus the attack scenario must involves a malicious glance backend operators.

Though since this is a flawed security mechanism, it surely warrants an CVE, but not necessarly an OSSA. What do you think ?

Assuming this feature is activated by default, here is the impact description draft:

Title: Use of MD5 in OpenStack Glance image signature

Reporter: Daniel P. Berrange (Red Hat)

Products: Glance

Affects: =11.0.0

Description:

Daniel P. Berrange from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Glance image signature. Glance computes cryptographic signature using MD5 hash of the image. By crafting a malicious image that produces a MD5 collision, a Glance backend operator may subvert the signature verification process, resulting in corrupted image. All Glance setups are affected.

Well it's kind of related, former bug was only about using MD5 for digest. Though this bug is about using MD5 digest for crypto signature.

This is indeed weak behavior as described. I do agree that attack vector is limited to cases where there is attack vector the the backend store, but on the other hand that's exactly what the signature verification is trying to prevent.

Hi Tristan, I am a bit confused by the last sentence of the description "All Glance setups are affected". I think this CVE only affects Liberty. Maybe I have misunderstood something. Does it mean that all Glance setups with Liberty are affected? Thank you very much.

Agreeing with everything Daniel Berrange has said. My summary of the issue is as follows:

Using MD5 to compute a digest of an image and then applying a digital signature to the digest means that the digital signature of the image is only as trustworthy as MD5. Since there have been practical attacks against MD5 generating collisions, it's not safe to use MD5 in this manner with a feature intended to provide security.

We will resolve the issue in Glance and push an implementation in Nova that does not have the vulnerability by switching over to signatures which are generated by signing the image data directly (i.e. not signing the MD5 or any other digest).

Add sign-the-hash deprecation warning

Per discussion on the mailing list [1] and the related nova specification [2]

    it has been decided that the signature should be of the image data directly,

    rather than of the glance MD5 "checksum" hash of the image data.

This patch adds TODO statements to remove the 'sign-the-hash' approach

    after the Mitaka development cycle, as well as a deprecation warning if

    the properties exist for the 'sign-the-hash' approach.

Remove unneeded glance unit test assert calls

The glance\_store library now accepts a verifier object for use with

    verifying signatures, as a result of a recently merged patch [1].

    There are some glance unit tests that do not expect this verifier

    object to be passed to the add method of glance\_store, and will

    therefore fail with a new release of the glance\_store library.

This patch removes the assert lines for the tests that will fail,

Remove unneeded glance unit test assert calls
The glance\_store library now accepts a verifier object for use with
verifying signatures, as a result of a recently merged patch [1].
There are some glance unit tests that do not expect this verifier
object to be passed to the add method of glance\_store, and will
therefore fail with a new release of the glance\_store library.
This patch removes the assert lines for the tests that will fail,
since it is not necessary for glance to test glance\_store in that
way at the glance level.

-- squashed with another change to get liberty working --
Remove glance\_store specific unit tests
TestStoreAddToBackend contains a set of tests that should belong to
the glance\_store. Recently, these tests were about to break
glance as they mocked internal methods. Those mocks were
removed in commit eab1567d48a18fa968c7b66c3641dd037da1f84e.
The tests are added back to glance\_store in
change https://review.openstack.org/#/c/273786.

commit 95ca43f30f5bcc8107e0615b3861daa2c77a2aec

Author: Brianna Poulos <email address hidden>

Date: Tue Dec 8 17:24:11 2015 -0500

Add sign-the-data signature verification

Per discussion on the mailing list [1] and the related nova

    specification [2] it has been decided that the signature should be of

    the image data directly, rather than of the glance MD5 "checksum" hash

    of the image data.

This patch adds the ability to verify a signature of the image data

    directly, using a verifier that is passed to the glance\_store backend.

    It is dependent on a glance\_store patch which updates this verifier

    object with the image data as it is creating the checksum (see

    Depends-On below).

* [Bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)

* [Answers](https://answers.launchpad.net/~openstack-ossg)

Overview:

The OpenStack Security SIG actively works to improve OpenStack security through improvements to code, architecture and various documentation efforts including vulnerability management (through the Vulnerability Management Team) and issuing of Security Notes.

The primary focus points for the security team are:

(1) Securing the OpenStack code base

(2) Providing deployers with the documentation needed to make sound security choices when deploying or consuming OpenStack

(3) Helping address security needs in a cross project collaborative way.

Author and maintain the OpenStack Security Guide:

\* <http://docs.openstack.org/sec/>

The security team conducts all non-confidential business on the openstack-sig mailing list with the [Security] tag.

\* Subscribe: <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-sigs>

We previously used the openstack-security mailing list

\* Archive: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-sigs/>

Advisory Activities:

\* Act as a consultancy group for OpenStack developers

\* The Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) exists as a subset of the Security SIG

\* VMT confidentially handles vulnerability disclosures

\* The wider security SIG can confirm vulnerability severity at the request of the VMT

Security Guidance:

\* OpenStack Security Notes provide Security Guidance on OpenStack Configuration and Usage: <https://launchpad.net/ossn/>

\* Issued Security Notes: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>

Research Activities:

\* Exploits / Proofs of Concept

\* Vulnerability Research

\* Threat Verification

\* Hardening

\* Security Architecture

\* Secure OpenStack Provisioning

\* Documenting Security Features

\* Configuration Management

\* Site Survey Functionality / Security Dashboard

\* More

Membership:

In April 2015 the Security SIG became an official part of OpenStack. Previously the security team was comprised of two separate organisations; the VMT and the OSSG. The VMT was a small team handling critical vulnerability reports and remediation whereas the OSSG formed the bulk of the remaining security activities within OpenStack. In early 2015 these teams merged, this was quickly followed by the Security team being accepted into OpenStack.

History of the OSSG:

Originally instigated in 2012 by HP and Nebula, the OSSG initially sought to work on an invite only basis, seeking to draw in contributors from large OpenStack teams such as Rackspace, Ubuntu and Red Hat. The team has grown significantly in size and function and now works on a moderated list model, we're open to contributors of all types and the list is moderated simply to keep out spammers.

In early 2018 what was the Security Project became the Security SIG

Security GIG Code of Ethics:

Members of the security team agree that the goals of the group are to improve the security of OpenStack. Information made available to the security team may at times be sensitive and should always be treated as confidential, not to be shared outside of the group. Members are expressly prohibited from profiting by sharing vulnerability or exploit information obtained from the security team with a third party. All group members agree to abide by industry best practices in responsible disclosure, including providing proper attribution for any technical contributions.

Leadership:

The security SIG has no formal leadership, instead it has chairs, with the current chairs being Luke Hinds (Red Hat) and Gage Hugo (AT&T).

Leadership Functions:

\* Formal liaison with OpenStack teams

\* Security team co-ordination

\* Driving Security Awareness

\* Providing Suggestions for Research Direction

\* More

Ongoing Tasks for the Security SIG:

\* Recruiting security talent

\* Evangelizing security within the community

\* Document current best practices - useful as a documentation exercise and for understanding next steps. (e.g., if best practices involve strongly isolating a particular component b/c it is riddled with security issues, then that will help reveal where we should be working)

\* Develop stress tests that can be integrated with current testing

# OSSN/OSSN-0061

< [OSSN](/wiki/OSSN "OSSN")

## Glance image signature uses an insecure hash algorithm (MD5)

### Summary

During the Liberty release the Glance project added a feature that
supports verifying images by their signature. There is a flaw in the
implementation that degrades verification by using the weak MD5
algorithm.

### Affected Services / Software

Glance, Liberty

### Discussion

A signature algorithm is typically created by hashing data and then
encrypting that hash in some way. In the case of the new Glance feature
the signature algorithm does not hash the image to be verified. It
rehashes the existing MD5 checksum that is used to locally verify the
integrity of image data stored in Glance.

The Glance image signature algorithm uses configurable hash algorithms.
No matter which algorithm is used, the overall security of the algorithm
is degraded to that of MD5 because instead of applying it to the image
data it's applied only to the MD5 checksum that already exists in
Glance.

The image signature algorithm is a relatively new feature, introduced in
the Liberty release.

### Recommended Actions

Users concerned with image security should be aware that the current
Glance signature algorithm is not secure by todays cryptographic
standards.

A specification for a fix has been proposed by the Glance development
team and is targeted for the Mitaka release.

# CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Glance

---

*From*: Tristan Cacqueray <tdecacqu () redhat com>

*Date*: Tue, 17 Nov 2015 22:00:57 +0000

```
A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Use of MD5 in OpenStack Glance image signature
Reporter: Daniel P. Berrange (Red Hat)
Products: Glance
Affects: =11.0.0

Description:
Daniel P. Berrange from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Glance image
signature. Glance computes cryptographic signature using MD5 hash of the
image. By crafting a malicious image that produces a MD5 collision, a
Glance backend operator may subvert the signature verification process,
resulting in a corrupted image. All Glance setups are affected.
