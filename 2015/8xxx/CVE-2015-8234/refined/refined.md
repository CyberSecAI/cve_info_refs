```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The OpenStack Glance image signature verification process uses the MD5 hash of the image instead of the image data itself. This makes the signature vulnerable to MD5 collision attacks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of MD5, a weak hashing algorithm, to generate a cryptographic signature.
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious Glance backend operator could craft a malicious image that produces an MD5 collision, subverting the signature verification process and resulting in a corrupted image.
- Attack vectors: A malicious Glance backend operator needs to provide a malicious image to the Glance service.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a Glance backend operator with the ability to supply images to the Glance service.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability affects the image signature verification feature introduced in the OpenStack Liberty release.
- The vulnerability is present because the signature is computed against the MD5 checksum of the image, instead of the image itself.
- The issue was discussed in public before the CVE was assigned.
- A fix has been implemented to sign the image data directly instead of the MD5 checksum.
