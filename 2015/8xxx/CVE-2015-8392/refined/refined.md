  "CVE-2015-8392": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in PCRE before 8.38 was found, caused by pattern with duplicated named groups and an occurrence of (?| , it is possible for an apparently non-recursive back reference to become recursive if a later named group with the relevant number is encountered.",
    "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
     "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of duplicated named groups within patterns containing the `(?|` construct. An apparently non-recursive back reference can become recursive due to a later named group having the relevant number, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "impact": "Denial of service (unintended recursion and buffer overflow) or possibly unspecified other impact, arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "By providing a crafted regular expression.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a regular expression string, often crossing a privilege boundary."
