The provided content relates to CVE-2015-8265.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Huawei Mobile WiFi E5151 and E5186 routers use static source ports for all DNS queries originating from the local area network (LAN). This lack of randomness makes it easier to spoof DNS responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of insufficiently random values (CWE-330)
- Static source ports for DNS queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can spoof DNS responses. This causes LAN clients to connect to incorrect or malicious hosts under the attacker's control. This compromises the normal service of DNS.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to intercept and spoof DNS responses directed to the vulnerable router on the network. They need network access to the targeted device.
