Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the `Horde_Core_VarRenderer_Html` class, specifically in how it renders number input fields. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a type of XSS that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can steal session cookies, allowing an attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access.
- **Data Theft:** JavaScript can be used to steal sensitive data that may be present in the victim's browser, including authentication credentials, personal details, etc.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the content of the page and display malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into a number input field. The lack of input sanitization leads to the injected script executing within the userâ€™s browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable number field.
- **User interaction:** For a reflected XSS, the victim must click a link or access a page containing the injected script.
- **Web application access:** The attacker needs access to the web application to trigger the vulnerability.
