Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-8555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Xen initializes the Floating Point Unit (FPU) stack and XMM registers when XSAVE/XRSTOR are not used for managing guest extended register state. Specifically, when a guest is started, the FPU stack and XMM registers might contain data left by the previous user of these registers, instead of being properly cleared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: Sensitive data (including cryptographic keys) from a previous domain may be inadvertently exposed to a newly started malicious domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious domain can potentially gain access to sensitive information, like cryptographic keys, from other domains on the same hypervisor, violating confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious guest domain that is running on the same hypervisor as other domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and run a malicious guest domain on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor. The system must be on x86 architecture without XSAVE or with XSAVE disabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all Xen versions on x86 systems lacking or with disabled XSAVE support, ARM systems are not vulnerable.
- Mitigation can be achieved by ensuring XSAVE is enabled on capable systems. If XSAVE is disabled via "no-xsave" or not enabled with the "xsave" option on the hypervisor command line, the vulnerability remains.
-  Patches are available for different Xen versions (4.3.x, 4.5.x, 4.6.x, and unstable).
