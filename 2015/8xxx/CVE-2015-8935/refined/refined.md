Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `sapi_header_op` function within `main/SAPI.c` in PHP. This function handles HTTP headers and, prior to the fix, supported deprecated line folding without considering browser compatibility. Specifically, it incorrectly processes `%0A%20` or `%0D%0A%20` sequences within header values when rendering HTTP responses, which allows for a bypass of header injection protection mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary content into HTTP headers, leading to XSS.
*  **Deprecated line folding support**: RFC 7230 deprecates line folding in HTTP headers. PHP's `header()` function supported it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the header, which is then interpreted and executed by the user's browser, specifically Internet Explorer. This allows for stealing cookies, session data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Header Injection:** The attacker could also inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to other security issues (though XSS is the main concern here).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with `%0A%20` or `%0D%0A%20` sequences within a header value.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The server-side PHP code must use the `header()` function to echo the untrusted input into an HTTP response header.
*   **Client Browser:** Internet Explorer is specifically vulnerable, because it mishandles the line folding when space follows a newline character.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any specific authentication level, thus being exploitable by anonymous users if the vulnerable code is reachable.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker must know that the target application utilizes the PHP `header()` function to output attacker-controlled data to HTTP headers.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer's interpretation of line folding. Other browsers treat new lines with leading spaces as part of the previous header value.
*   The fix involves removing support for multi-line headers, as deprecated by RFC 7230.
*   The vulnerability has been present in the `header()` function of PHP versions before 5.4.38, 5.5.22, and 5.6.6.
*   The issue was first reported on Feb 3, 2015.
*   The fix was committed and was included in later snapshots and releases of PHP.
