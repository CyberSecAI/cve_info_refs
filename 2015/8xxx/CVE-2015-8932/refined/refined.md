Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8932:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid left shift operation within the `compress_bidder_init` function in `archive_read_support_filter_compress.c` in libarchive. The shift was occurring with a 32 bit signed integer with a shift value of 31 bytes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Undefined behavior due to the invalid left shift operation.
- Integer overflow issue.
- Potential memory corruption or out-of-bounds access related to the usage of a signed integer as an offset value (as described in the RedHat bugzilla entries for CVE-2015-8923, which is often mentioned alongside CVE-2015-8932)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) through application crash.
- May potentially cause memory disclosure in some conditions (as it was grouped with other out-of-bounds read issues, although this specific CVE did not allow for direct data exfiltration).

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation can be achieved by providing a crafted archive file (e.g., a tar file), specifically designed to trigger the invalid left shift when libarchive parses the compress stream headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed archive to a libarchive-using application for processing, with the aim of triggering the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to how compress streams are identified, which can lead to a crash if a specially crafted file is encountered.
- RedHat states that a crafted compress stream could cause an application to fail to read the archive or cause a crash.
- The fix involves preventing the left shift with a value greater than or equal to the variable's bit size, and also adding logic to reject a negative skipsize.
- Several reports group CVE-2015-8932 with other vulnerabilities found in libarchive, specifically CVE-2015-8920, CVE-2015-8921, CVE-2015-8933, CVE-2016-4809, CVE-2016-5844, CVE-2016-7166, and sometimes also mentioning CVE-2016-5418
- Some of the reports and fixes refer to specific commits on GitHub that addressed the vulnerabilities.
