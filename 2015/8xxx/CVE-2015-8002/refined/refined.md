Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8002:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient validation within the chunked upload API in MediaWiki. Specifically, there was a lack of checks on chunk sizes and the overall upload process, which allowed for malicious manipulation of the file upload mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Missing Chunk Size Validation:** The API didn't enforce a minimum chunk size for non-final chunks. This allowed an attacker to upload very small chunks (e.g., 1 byte) repeatedly, potentially creating a large number of files on the server's filesystem, leading to a denial-of-service.
2.  **Missing File Size Limit Enforcement**: The API failed to properly prevent adding new chunks to an upload once the reported size was exceeded, allowing the attacker to upload an unlimited number of chunks for a single file, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.
3. **Lack of final chunk marker:** The API did not properly handle the final chunk, allowing an attacker to send many small "final" chunks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading numerous tiny chunks or an excessive number of chunks exceeding the declared file size, an attacker could cause resource exhaustion on the server, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **File System Overload:** The creation of a large number of small files could overwhelm the file system, leading to performance issues and potentially crashing the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chunked Upload API:** The vulnerability was located within the chunked upload API of MediaWiki.
*   **Malicious Client:** An attacker would need a malicious client capable of sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the MediaWiki instance.
*   **Understanding of the API:** The attacker would need some understanding of the MediaWiki API, specifically the chunked file upload functionality.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests**:  The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to exploit the API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by a Wikipedia user, RobinHood70.
*   The fix involved several changes, including enforcing a minimum chunk size for non-final chunks, preventing the upload of additional chunks after the declared file size has been reached, and ensuring that only one final chunk is accepted.
*   The fix was backported to older MediaWiki versions (1.23, 1.24, and 1.25) in addition to the master branch and 1.26.
*  The minimum chunk size was set to 1KB to prevent issues, but this could be increased in the future.
*  The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.25.3, 1.24.4, and 1.23.11.
