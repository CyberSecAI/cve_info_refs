{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the failure to test for an integer overflow when multiplying the `biClrUsed` value by four during the handling of BMP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious BMP file or visits a malicious page containing a malicious BMP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to open a crafted BMP file or visit a webpage serving it."
