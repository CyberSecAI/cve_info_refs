This is a security update to the stable version 1.0. It contains some important bug fixes and security improvements back-ported from the master branch.

It's considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube 1.0.x with this version if for some reason you're not able to upgrade to the latest stable version. Please do backup your data before updating!

*Reported by akhilreni on 29 Dec 2015 11:46 UTC as Trac ticket #1490625*

Hello,

Svg images generally contain css, but more importantly javascript.

The fact that you can execute JavaScript from inside an image file presents an unexpected vector for XSS attacks.

After uploading the following svg file as attachment to an email will execute javascript.

<script type="text/javascript">
alert(document.cookie);
</script>

Steps to reproduce:

-Compose email

-save the above code as xss.svg

-attach the svg file

-Check the email

-open attachment in new tab

-Xss will be triggered.

*Migrated-From: <http://trac.roundcube.net/ticket/1490625>*

Good start! Removing script nodes, however, is just the beginning. XSS code can also be in node attributes like `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `href="javascript:`, etc. or even in CSS `url()` as we learned with HTML messages.

So traversing the entire DOM is probably necessary to provide protection that goes beyond the one example we received.

Sorry, something went wrong.
