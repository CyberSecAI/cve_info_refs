| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=980377#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2016-05-17 15:02:38 UTC  ``` rh#1336745  Multiple vulnerabilities were found in dosfstools. The variable used for storing the FAT size (in bytes) was an unsignedint. Since the size in sectors read from the BPB was not sufficiently checked, this could end up being zero after multiplying it with the sector size while some offsets still stayed excessive. Ultimately it would cause segfaults when accessing FAT entries for which no memory was allocated.

An invalid memory read (heap oob) can happen with a malformed filesystem in the function get\_fat().

This was found with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.

[`786e66e`](/dosfstools/dosfstools/commit/786e66e34c6ba46367623686f952a7e35be2222c)

The programs are now portable to non-Linux operating systems. To that end, the build system has been converted to use autotools. There have been Linux specifics in a lot of places which have been either eliminated or should have equivalents so that it should now work in other Unix-like environments. It has been tested on FreeBSD and OS X.

As part of making it portable all the code that assumed 8 bit major/minor numbers – and in fact masked out all other bits – has been cleaned up. Now `mkfs.vfat` should not misidentify devices anymore and require the `-I` option to override. The new device probing uses libudev (if available) to collect more information.

Fixed data corruption errors in `fsck.fat`: Writing to the third to last cluster on FAT12 with an odd number of clusters would corrupt the following cluster. In `mkfs.fat`, long existing bugs in bad cluster marking (from scanning or user supplied bad blocks list) were fixed so that it actually marks the correct clusters.

The automatic alignment of data clusters that was added in 3.0.8 and broken for FAT32 starting with 3.0.20 has been reinstated. If you need to create file systems for finicky devices that have broken FAT implementations use the option `-a` to disable alignment.

# CVE-2015-8872

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-8871.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-8873.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-8872 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8872)

#### Description

The set\_fat function in fat.c in dosfstools before 4.0 might allow attackers to corrupt a FAT12 filesystem or cause a denial of service (invalid memory read and crash) by writing an odd number of clusters to the third to last entry on a FAT12 filesystem, which triggers an "off-by-two error."

specially crafted filesystem.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Packages

* [dosfstools](/security/cves?package=dosfstools) - utilities for making and checking MS-DOS FAT filesystems

## Details

Hanno Böck discovered that dosfstools incorrectly handled certain malformed

filesystems. A local attacker could use this issue to cause dosfstools to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=980364#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2016-05-17 14:39:40 UTC  ``` rh#1336739  A vulnerability was found in dosfstools. In FAT12 two 12 bit entries are combined to a 24 bit value (three bytes). Therefore, when an even numbered FAT entry is set in FAT12, it must be be combined with the following entry. To prevent accessing beyond the end of the FAT array, it must be checked that the cluster is not the last one.  Previously, the check tested that the requested cluster was equal to fs->clusters - 1. However, fs->clusters is the number of data clusters not including the two reserved FAT entries at the start so the test triggered two clusters early.  If the third to last entry was written on a FAT12 filesystem with an odd number of clusters, the second to last entry would be corrupted. This corruption may also lead to invalid memory accesses when the corrupted entry becomes out of bounds and is used later.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for dosfstools
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2016:2233-1
Rating: moderate
References: #912607 #980364 #980377
Cross-References: CVE-2015-8872 CVE-2016-4804
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
dosfstools was updated to fix two security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2015-8872: The set\_fat function in fat.c in dosfstools might have
allowed attackers to corrupt a FAT12 filesystem or cause a denial of
service (invalid memory read and crash) by writing an odd number of
clusters to the third to last entry on a FAT12 filesystem, which
triggers an "off-by-two error (bsc#980364).
- CVE-2016-4804: The read\_boot function in boot.c in dosfstools allowed
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted filesystem,
which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in the (1) read\_fat function
or an out-of-bounds heap read in (2) get\_fat function (bsc#980377).
This non-security issue was fixed:
- bsc#912607: Attempt to rename root dir in fsck due to uninitialized
fields.
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE Leap 42.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2016-1045=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Apr 12, 2016](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/25#issue-147804316)

The attached file will cause a heap overflow in the function read\_fat (it's zip-packed, because github only allows certain file types).

This was found via fuzzing with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Sep 8, 2015](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/12#issue-105325850)

This file will generate some invalid memory read in fsck.vfat:

<https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/dosfstools-get_fat-invalid-read>

Judging from the output of address sanitizer and valgrind it is a bit unusual, it seems to be neither memory on the stack or heap, but it also doesn't crash the app if run without asan or valgrind. Happens both with the latest release and latest git code.

Found with american fuzzy lop.

This is the address sanitizer stack trace:

```

## [dosfstools / fsck.vfat: Several invalid memory accesses](/44-dosfstools-fsck.vfat-Several-invalid-memory-accesses.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Sunday, May 8. 2016

I lately fuzzed various filesystem check tools. This uncovered a number of issues in dosfstools / fsck.fat that have now been fixed in the new version 4.0. All issues were found with american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer.

[Heap out of bounds read in get\_fat()](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/issues/26)

[Git commit / fix for both issues](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/commit/e8eff147e9da1185f9afd5b25948153a3b97cf52)

[CVE-2016-4804](https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4804)

These bugs can pose a security risk if a system automatically checks attached storage media with fsck or in situations where filesystems on untrusted devices get checked. The new version [dosfstools 4.0](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools/releases/tag/v4.0) fixes all four bugs.

set\_fat(): Fix off-by-2 error leading to corruption in FAT12

```
In FAT12 two 12 bit entries are combined to a 24 bit value (three
bytes). Therefore, when an even numbered FAT entry is set in FAT12, it
must be be combined with the following entry. To prevent accessing
beyond the end of the FAT array, it must be checked that the cluster is
not the last one.

Previously, the check tested that the requested cluster was equal to
fs->clusters - 1. However, fs->clusters is the number of data clusters
not including the two reserved FAT entries at the start so the test
triggered two clusters early.

If the third to last entry was written on a FAT12 filesystem with an
odd number of clusters, the second to last entry would be corrupted.
This corruption may also lead to invalid memory accesses when the
corrupted entry becomes out of bounds and is used later.

Change the test to fs->clusters + 1 to fix.
