Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the `tx_consume` function within the Rocker switch emulation code of QEMU.
- It occurs when processing transmit (tx) descriptors. The code incorrectly handles cases where a descriptor contains more than the maximum allowed number of fragments (ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX, which is 16).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Off-by-one error:** The code increments the `iovcnt` variable before checking if it exceeds `ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX`, leading to out-of-bounds access. Specifically, it increments `iovcnt` and then checks `if (++iovcnt > ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX)`, while it should check before incrementing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Leakage:** A privileged user inside the guest virtual machine can trigger the flaw to leak memory from the host.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can crash the QEMU process, leading to a denial-of-service condition on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Guest-to-Host:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious or compromised guest virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged user in guest:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run code inside the guest virtual machine.
- **Rocker switch enabled:** The QEMU instance must be configured to use the Rocker switch emulation.
- **Crafted network traffic:** Attacker needs to send network traffic from the guest that triggers the vulnerable code path (descriptors with more than 16 fragments).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc.
- The fix involves correcting the bounds check by performing the check before incrementing `iovcnt`.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2015-8701 states: "An off-by-one vulnerability was discovered in the QEMU emulator built with Rocker-switch emulation support. The flaw occurred when processing transmit(tx) descriptors in the 'tx\_consume' routine, if a descriptor had more than the allowed fragments (ROCKER\_TX_FRAGS_MAX=16)."
