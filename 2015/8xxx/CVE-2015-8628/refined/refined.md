Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how MediaWiki handles redirects for certain special pages, specifically `Special:MyPage`, `Special:MyTalk`, `Special:MyContributions`, and related pages.  These pages redirect to user-specific pages (e.g., `User:Username`). The vulnerability stems from the fact that the redirects were HTTP redirects, which allowed external sites to track users by inducing browsers to load these special pages and then checking public page view statistics.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary weakness is the disclosure of a user's identity by correlating visits to special pages (like `Special:MyPage`) with the corresponding user pages in page view statistics. The vulnerability existed because the server-side redirect from these special pages to user pages was being recorded in page view stats.
*   **Lack of Privacy Protection:**  MediaWiki was combining basic visited-URI information with session information (which identifies the user) and expanding the scope of the visited URI concept. This was not obvious, as the transformation of `Special:MyPage` to `User:Xavier_Combelle` did not signal that an analytics implementation should be concerned about the information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could use an external site to track which Wikipedia users are viewing their site, allowing the attacker to potentially correlate user identities with other data they may have.
*   On low-traffic wikis, it was easier to identify users even with only a few page views.
*   An attacker could convince a user to load the special pages multiple times (e.g., using hidden iframes) to amplify the signal in the statistics.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could embed the vulnerable special page in an iframe or image on an external website that they control. When a logged-in user visits that external site, the user's browser would load the special page and trigger the unwanted page view count in the target wiki.
*   The attacker can induce a user's browser to load the special page using JavaScript or an ajax call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to host or control a website where they can embed the malicious code or links.
*   The attacker needs no special capabilities other than a means to make a logged in user load a page containing a link to the vulnerable special pages.
* The attacker has to be able to access and read the publicly available page view statistics to correlate the user with the request.

**Mitigation:**
 The vulnerability was mitigated by making the redirect a "soft" redirect handled by javascript.  The browser's address bar will not change to the destination page, and the page counts will only record a visit to the `Special:MyPage` rather than the redirected user page, which avoids the information disclosure. MediaWiki now transforms the `Special:MyPage` request into the target page via JavaScript rather than an HTTP redirect. The URL in the browser's address bar is dynamically updated using the History API when JavaScript is enabled.
 A configuration setting `$wgHideIdentifiableRedirects` was introduced to allow disabling the mitigation for wikis that do not publish detailed page view data publicly.

**Note:** The fix included changes to prevent caching of these pages, as they vary per user, and includes changes to set the `$wgTitle` and reset cached action names.
