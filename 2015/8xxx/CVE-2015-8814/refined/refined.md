Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8814:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token validation in several areas of the Umbraco CMS, specifically within the non-editor API controllers.  The `templates.asmx.cs` file was executing save operations without verifying CSRF tokens, and the `SetAngularAntiForgeryTokensAttributes.cs` allowed empty CSRF values to pass validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection in several API endpoints.  The system was not correctly verifying the presence and validity of CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could perform unauthorized actions on the Umbraco CMS application.  Specifically, the provided text notes that "sensitive actions, such as editing a user account information was vulnerable to CSRF vulnerability".
*   An attacker could perform state changing actions that would normally be performed by a user, like saving data or modifying account settings

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted web request sent by the attacker which is triggered in the browser of an authenticated user.
*   The attacker can potentially leverage the fact that the server doesn't enforce CSRF token validation on specific actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into sending a malicious web request. This can be accomplished via links or iframes in the context of a user that has access to the relevant actions.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the Umbraco application itself but does need knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved implementing a `ValidateMvcAngularAntiForgeryTokenAttribute` which validates the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header as well as a corresponding cookie value.
*   This commit includes changes to `Extensions.js` to set the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header on all AJAX requests.
*   The fix was implemented by checking the anti-forgery tokens for the following API controllers:
    *   `BulkPublishController`
    *   `DomainsApiController`
    *   `ExamineManagementApiController`
    *   `SaveFileController`
    *   `XmlDataIntegrityController`
