Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `pcre_compile` function within the PCRE library. Specifically, the function mishandles certain nesting of POSIX character classes (e.g., `[:alnum:]`, `[:digit:]`, etc.), which leads to inefficient processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Inefficient processing of POSIX character class nesting:** The core issue is that when a regex contains deeply nested POSIX character classes, the `pcre_compile` function does not handle them efficiently causing excessive CPU consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker, by providing a crafted regular expression, can cause excessive CPU consumption due to the inefficient processing in `pcre_compile`, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

-  **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, some sources mention that an attacker could *possibly* execute arbitrary code. This might be due to the potential to cause buffer overflow and corrupt the memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Specially crafted regular expressions:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a regular expression that contains specific nested POSIX character classes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to submit regex:** The attacker must be able to submit a crafted regular expression to an application or service that utilizes the vulnerable PCRE library for regex processing. This could be a remote attacker if the application is exposed to an untrusted network.
- **No authentication required:** Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any specific authentication or privilege level.

**Additional Technical Details and Notes:**
-   The vulnerability is present in PCRE versions prior to 8.38.
-   The issue was introduced with a change in the `check_posix_syntax()` function in PCRE version 8.13.
-   The vulnerability can be triggered with deeply nested character class syntax (e.g. `[:[:[:...:]:]:]` or `[[[.\xe8Nq\xffq\xff\xe0\x2|||::Nq\xffq\xff\xe0\x6\x2|||::[[[:[::::::[[[[[::::::::[:[[[:[:::[[[[[[[[[[[[:::::::::::::::::[[.\xe8Nq\xffq\xff\xe0\x2|||::Nq\xffq\xff\xe0\x6\x2|||::[[[:[::::::[[[[[::::::::[:[[[:[:::[[[[[[[[[[[[[[:::E[[[:[:[[:[:::[[:::E[[[:[:[[:'[:::::E[[[:[::::::[[[:[[[[[[[::E[[[:[::::::[[[:[[[[[[[[:[[::[::::[[:::::::[[:[[[[[[[:[[::[:[[:[~`).
-   The vulnerability exists when PCRE is used in "applications that allow their users to supply patterns" (from PCRE documentation), which could also be through applications using regular expressions to match specific strings.
-   Several vendors like Red Hat and IBM have issued security advisories to fix this issue.
