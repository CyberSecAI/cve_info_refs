Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `ff_get_buffer` function in `libavcodec/utils.c` in FFmpeg. This function fails to clear or reset the width and height values after a buffer allocation failure. This can lead to an out-of-bounds array access if these stale dimensions are used in subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Error Handling:** The core issue is that the `ff_get_buffer` function does not properly handle allocation failures, specifically by not resetting width and height values after a failure.
*   **Out-of-bounds Array Access:** The vulnerability can lead to an out-of-bounds array access because of the use of preserved, stale, and potentially incorrect width/height values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to the out-of-bounds array access. This can crash the application or cause it to behave unpredictably.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** The description mentions a possibility of unspecified other impact, suggesting that the out-of-bounds write could potentially lead to other more severe issues, but this is not confirmed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted .mov file:** A specially crafted .mov file containing malicious data can trigger this vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs during processing of this crafted file when the buffer allocation fails but the dimensions are not cleared leading to the out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted file to a vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves clearing the width and height values in `ff_get_buffer()` on failure.
*   The vulnerability is present in FFmpeg versions before 2.8.4.
*   Several distributions and products were affected including SUSE and Debian.
*   The provided content includes bug reports, security advisories, and fix information from SUSE and Debian. These all confirm that the root cause is an incorrect handling of buffer allocation failure within `ff_get_buffer` function, which does not reset the dimensions on failure, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
