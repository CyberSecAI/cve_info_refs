The stable channel has been updated to 47.0.2526.80 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This release contains an update to Adobe Flash Player (20.0.0.228) and security fixes.

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [7 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-1-M47&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$2000][[557981](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=557981)] High CVE-2015-6789: Use-after-free in Blink. Credit to cloudfuzzer.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. The total value of additional rewards and their recipients will updated here when all reports have gone through the reward panel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[567513](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=567513)] CVE-2015-6791: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 4.7 branch (currently 4.7.80.23).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer) or [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity).

A partial list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/47.0.2526.73..47.0.2526.80?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

## Details

A race condition was discovered in the MutationObserver implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-6789](/security/CVE-2015-6789))

An issue was discovered with the page serializer in Blink. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to inject arbitrary script or HTML.

([CVE-2015-6790](/security/CVE-2015-6790))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6791](/security/CVE-2015-6791))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-8548](/security/CVE-2015-8548))

An integer overflow was discovered in the WebCursor::Deserialize function

in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-8664](/security/CVE-2015-8664))
