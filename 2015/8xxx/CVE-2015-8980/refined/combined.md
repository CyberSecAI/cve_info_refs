# php-gettext php code execution in select\_string, ngettext, npgettext count parameter <1.0.12

---

*From*: crashenator () gmail com

*Date*: Mon, 15 Aug 2016 06:59:36 -0500

```

CERT ID - VU#520504 (pending since 2015)
Product - php-gettext
Company - Danilo Segan
Name - php-gettext php code execution
Versions - <1.0.12
Patched - 11/11/2015
Ref: <https://launchpad.net/php-gettext/trunk/1.0.12>

```
Vulnerability - "code injection into the ngettext family of calls:
evaluating the plural form formula can execute arbitrary code if number
is passed unsanitized from the untrusted user."
```

Description -
In 1.0.11 and lower the select_string function appears as the following:

  /**
   * Detects which plural form to take
   *
   * @access private
   * @param n count
   * @return int array index of the right plural form
   */
  function select_string($n) {
    $string = $this->get_plural_forms();
    $string = str_replace('nplurals',"\$total",$string);
    $string = str_replace("n",$n,$string);
    $string = str_replace('plural',"\$plural",$string);
    $total = 0;
    $plural = 0;
    eval("$string");
    if ($plural >= $total) $plural = $total - 1;
    return $plural;
  }

```
The vulnerability here lies in the fact that $string is evaluated as PHP
code. If the plural form contains an 'n', and the $n parameter is
exposed to a malicious user, PHP code can be added to the value of
$string before it is evaluated. For websites, this means that a
vulnerable application could allow an attacker to run PHP code on your
site and potentially gain control of it.
```

```
The $n parameter in select\_string can also be exposed through ngettext
and npgettext as the $number parameter.
```

```
The new release 1.0.12 was made available shortly after notification in
2015 and resolves the issue by raising an exception during non-numeric
input to these parameters.
```

## Release notes

This release includes a fix for potential security issue allowing code injection into the ngettext family of calls: evaluating the plural form formula can execute arbitrary code if number is passed unsanitized from the untrusted user. php-gettext will now throw an exception if the value being passed in is not a number, thus supporting good programming practices: always validate user input at the point of "entry".

Long-committed but never released fix for [bug 734494](/bugs/734494) is also included.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This CVE This bug relates to the "php-gettext", a gettext emulation in pure PHP code.

The binary packages php5-gettext, php53-gettext, php7-gettext, as shipped in SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE, however, contain the native PHP gettext extension built from C sources. By it's nature it does not contain the vulnerable code for this CVE.
