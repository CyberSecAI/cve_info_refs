Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-8980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `select_string` function of the `php-gettext` library. This function evaluates a plural form formula as PHP code using `eval()`. If the input `$n` (the number) parameter is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious PHP code into the string that is passed to `eval()`, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:**  The primary weakness is the use of `eval()` to execute a string that includes user-controlled input. The lack of sanitization of the `$n` parameter allows for arbitrary code injection.
- **Unsafe Use of `eval()`:** The `eval()` function executes a string as PHP code, and when the string is built using user-supplied data, it becomes a severe vulnerability.
- **Exposure Through Parameters:** The `$n` parameter in `select_string` can be indirectly controlled through the `$number` parameter in `ngettext` and `npgettext` functions, further widening the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can potentially lead to complete server compromise, data theft, modification, and denial of service.
- **Website Control:** An attacker could gain full control of the vulnerable website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a crafted, malicious value for the `$n` parameter to the `select_string` function through either the `ngettext` or `npgettext` functions.
- Specifically, the attacker crafts a value for the `$n` parameter that includes malicious PHP code embedded within the plural form formula.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control the $n parameter:** The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the value of the `$n` parameter that is passed into the vulnerable `select_string` function, either directly or indirectly through the `ngettext` or `npgettext` functions.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, assuming the input is not correctly sanitized.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability exists in `php-gettext` versions prior to 1.0.12.
- **Mitigation:** The fix implemented in version 1.0.12 addresses this by raising an exception when non-numeric input is provided to the vulnerable parameters.
- **phpMyAdmin:** While phpMyAdmin uses the vulnerable library, it was stated that phpMyAdmin itself is not directly vulnerable, but the embedded `php-gettext` library required patching.

In summary, CVE-2015-8980 describes a critical code injection vulnerability in `php-gettext` due to the insecure use of `eval()` and the lack of input sanitization. The impact of successful exploitation can be severe, potentially leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable system.
