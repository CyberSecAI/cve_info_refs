It highlights a heap overflow in pcre_exec, which is described in the changelog as “Fuzzing the pcretest tool uncovered an input leading to a heap overflow in the function pcre_exec. This bug was found with the help of american fuzzy lop and address sanitizer. Upstream bug #1637”. The document also states that the issue is changelog item 10 in 8.38. It also mentions other issues fixed in version 8.38 including two heap overflows in compile_regex (bugs #1667, #1672), and a stack overflow in compile_regex (bug #1515). CVE-2015-2327 and CVE-2015-2328 are mentioned in connection with bugs #1503 and #1515."

It notes that the vulnerability is fixed in pcre 8.38 and corresponds to item 4 in the PCRE changelog. Additionally, the bugzilla notes that commit 4b79af6b4cbeb5326ae5e4d83f3e935e00286c19 fixed the buffer overflow issue caused by duplicated named recursive back references. The vulnerability was introduced in upstream version 8.34. The bug is also identified as a duplicate of CVE-2015-3210, although it is later noted that they are treated as separate issues due to MITRE's decision."
