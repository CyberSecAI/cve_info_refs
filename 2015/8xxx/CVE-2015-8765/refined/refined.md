{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure deserialization of data in the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library. Specifically, the ACC InvokerTransformer class allows arbitrary code execution when used to deserialize data from untrusted sources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on a Java application or library that has the vulnerable ACC library in its classpath. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java functions or bytecode.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends malicious serialized data to a Java application that uses the vulnerable ACC library. This can happen through input streams such as files or network sockets.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send malicious serialized data to a Java application that uses the vulnerable ACC library. They need to have access to an input stream that the application deserializes. The application must have the vulnerable version of the library in its classpath."
