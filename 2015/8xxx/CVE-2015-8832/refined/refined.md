Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient filtering of file extensions during media uploads in Dotclear 2.8.1. While the application attempts to block PHP files (.php, .php4, .php5), it fails to block other executable extensions such as .pht, .phps, and .phtml.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Inadequate File Extension Filtering:** The regular expression used to filter file uploads `/\.php[0-9]*$/i` only blocked specific php file extensions, not others like .pht, .phps and .phtml
-   **Code Execution:** By uploading files with the above mentioned extensions, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Insufficient Media Exclusion Control:** The media exclusion pattern defined in the settings was not comprehensive enough.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to:
-   Complete compromise of the web application.
-   Data theft or modification.
-   Server takeover.
-   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **File Upload:** Attackers exploit the file upload functionality in the media manager.
-   **Web Interface:** The specific upload form is located at `http://localhost/dotclear/admin/media.php?popup=1&plugin_id=dcLegacyEditor`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account with the "manage their own media items" and "manage their own entries and comments" permissions. This suggests that a non-administrator user might still have sufficient privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Access to the Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable Dotclear instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Dotclear version 2.8.2 by expanding the regular expression for file exclusion to include extensions like `\.phps?|pht(ml)?|phl` to `/\.(phps?|pht(ml)?|phl)[0-9]*$/i`.
- The vendor was informed on 10/02/2015 and released a fix on 10/25/2015.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.0 (High)
