Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a static out-of-bounds read in the RSL (Radio Signaling Link) dissector within Wireshark. This occurs in the `dissct_rsl_ipaccess_msg` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is an out-of-bounds read within the RSL dissector when processing a malformed packet. This is a memory safety issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

    - Injecting a malformed RSL packet onto a network being monitored by Wireshark.
    -  Convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file containing malformed RSL data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to either be able to send network traffic that Wireshark is capturing, or be able to craft a malicious capture file.  No special privileges are required beyond the ability to transmit network packets or provide a file to be opened by the target.
