Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow located in the `lldp_decode` function within `daemon/protocols/lldp.c` of the lldpd software.
*   The overflow occurs when processing a Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) Management Address TLV (Type-Length-Value) that contains an excessively large management address. Specifically, the code copies the address into a fixed-size buffer (`addr_str_buffer`) without properly validating its length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120):** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. Data is written beyond the allocated buffer size, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not adequately validate the size of the management address received in the LLDP packet before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate and likely impact is a denial-of-service condition, resulting in a crash of the `lldpd` daemon.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** In cases where compiler hardening is not enabled, the buffer overflow can become exploitable for arbitrary code execution if the attacker is able to overwrite critical memory locations during the overflow. This is less likely due to the static nature of the buffer, but remains a potential impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted LLDP packet containing a management address TLV with an oversized address. The vulnerable system receives the crafted packet via a network interface.
*   **LLDP Protocol:** The attack relies on the LLDP protocol, which is commonly used for network device discovery and neighbor advertisement.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable system. The ability to send LLDP packets to the targeted system is crucial.
*   **LLDP Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be capable of creating or modifying LLDP packets to include a malicious management address TLV with a size exceeding the buffer's capacity.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any need for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Hardening:** The severity of the vulnerability is influenced by compiler hardening options. When hardening is enabled, the memcpy operation will be protected by compiler-emitted checks, preventing arbitrary code execution and causing only a crash. However, the crash still leads to a DoS condition.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability exists in lldpd versions prior to 0.8.0.
*   **OpenWrt Impact:** It was noted that some platforms such as OpenWrt may have hardening disabled making them more susceptible to exploitation.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to lldpd version 0.8.0 or later.
*   Disable LLDP support on Ethernet ports to prevent exposure to the attack vector.
