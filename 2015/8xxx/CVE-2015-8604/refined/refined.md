Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `graphs_new.php` file of Cacti.
*   The `cg_g` parameter in the POST request is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization for the `cg_g` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the Cacti database.
*   This could lead to the compromise of the web application, data exfiltration, modification or deletion, and potentially the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `graphs_new.php`.
*   The malicious SQL code is inserted into the `cg_g` parameter within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Cacti server.
*   No specific authentication seems to be required for exploitation, as the exploit mentions "any user" can conduct the attack
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `cg_g` to craft the exploit.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `form_save` function within `graphs_new.php`, which processes the POST data.
*   Specifically, the `cg_g` parameter is used to build a query without proper filtering or escaping:
```php
if (preg_match('/^cg_g$/', $var)) {
    if ($_POST["cg_g"] > 0) {
        $selected_graphs["cg"]{$_POST["cg_g"]}{$_POST["cg_g"]} = true;
    }
}
```
*   Later, the `$graph_template_id` variable taken from `$_POST["cg_g"]` is directly used in a SQL query within the `host_new_graphs` function:
```php
html_start_box("<strong>Create Graph from '" . db_fetch_cell("select name from graph_templates where id=$graph_template_id") . "'", "100%", "", "3", "center", "");
```

**Exploit:**

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided:

```

**Affected Versions:**

*   Cacti versions 0.8.8f and prior.

**Resolution:**

*   Upgrade to Cacti version 0.8.8h or later. Patches are also available.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2015-8377, another SQL injection flaw in Cacti.
*   Debian has issued DSA-3494-1 to address this vulnerability, along with CVE-2015-8377, indicating it impacts multiple distributions of cacti.
