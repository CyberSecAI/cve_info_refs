{
  "CVE-2015-8949": {
    "Description": "DBD::mysql versions 4.033 and earlier have a use after free bug in the my_login() function. When my_login fails, the code tries to call mysql_errno on the mysql connection. However my_login has already free'd that connection variable, therefore causing a use-after-free error. The issue was fixed in version 4.034.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use-after-free in the `my_login` function of `DBD::mysql`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service against an application using DBD::mysql (application crash), or potentially to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the login process to the mysql database server when the login fails.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to cause a login failure in order to trigger the vulnerability. Remote exploitation is possible, specifically during a failed login attempt."
