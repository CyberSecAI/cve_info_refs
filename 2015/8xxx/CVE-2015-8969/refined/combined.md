Fastclone is using cocaine improperly, allowing malicious command injection.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I think it would be easier to read with separate named args, i.e.

```
Cocaine::CommandLine.new('git clone', '--quiet --reference :mirror :repository :directory')
  .run(mirror: mirror, repository: url, directory: File.join(abs_clone_path, src_dir))

```

| The code isn't the prettiest, but it does look safe after reading through it. This is safe from the two POCs I provided. I'm really not an expert on Cocaine::CommandLine though.  I'd echo [@dlubarov](https://github.com/dlubarov) and suggest you use use multiple meaningfully named parameters in `clone`, `thread_update_submodule` and `store_updated_repo`.  It looks like you're using the interpolations from Cocaine correctly and safely now. |

| Yeah, it's really difficult to follow right now. I'll revert it and add the meaningfully-named parameters tomorrow. |
