Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8284:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper authorization controls. The application lacks sufficient access controls to restrict non-administrative users from performing administrative functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** A low-privileged user (viewer) can perform actions that should only be available to administrators. This includes creating, updating, and deleting users (including admin users), and accessing configuration files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Complete system compromise:** A low-privileged user can gain full administrative control over the system. This allows attackers to:
    *   Create new admin users.
    *   Delete existing users, including the administrator.
    *   Modify existing users, including changing admin passwords.
    *   Access sensitive configuration files, such as `policy.xml`, `cookie_config.xml`, and `systemCfg.xml`.
*   **Data breach:** Access to configuration files could reveal sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP requests:** By sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `system_manage.php` and `configure_manage.php` endpoints, a low-privileged attacker can bypass authorization checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid low-privileged (viewer) user account on the affected system.
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web interface of the SeaWell Networks Spectrum application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing specific URLs with crafted parameters, such as:
    *   `/system_manage.php?username=[new_username]&password=[new_password]&userlevel=9&action=add_user` for creating a new admin user.
    *   `/system_manage.php?username=[user_to_delete]&action=delete_user&ekey=[user_id]` for deleting a user.
    *   `/system_manage.php?username=[user_to_modify]&password=[new_password]&userlevel=9&action=update_user&ekey=[user_id]` for modifying a user (including changing admin password)
    *   `/configure_manage.php?action=download_config&file=[config_file_name.xml]` for downloading configuration files.

The vulnerability is present in SeaWell Networks Spectrum SDC version 02.05.00, Build 02.05.00.0016.
