The provided content relates to CVE-2015-8281.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The firmware filesystem uses a weak custom encryption scheme based only on simple XOR operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327). The device implements a weak, custom encryption scheme instead of using established cryptographic methods. Specifically, the encryption is based on simple XOR operations.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially decrypt and access sensitive data stored within the firmware filesystem.

**Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the device's firmware filesystem.
