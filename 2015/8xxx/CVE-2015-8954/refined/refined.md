Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8954:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A logic error in the `MemcmpLowercase` function within the Suricata intrusion detection system. Specifically, the first byte of the compared strings was excluded during the lowercase comparison.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect String Comparison:** The `MemcmpLowercase` function, designed for case-insensitive string comparisons, incorrectly skips the first byte, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Detection Rules:** Due to the flawed comparison, various Suricata keywords and parsers could be bypassed, leading to false negatives and missed attack detection. Specifically:
    *   HTTP multipart parsing can fail, leading to incorrect file matching and extraction.
    *   The `http_header` keyword would not correctly inspect specific headers. For example, headers with names like "Xookie" or "Xet-cookie" (where X is not 'c'/'C' or 's'/'S', respectively) would not be properly detected.
    *   The `fileext` keyword can be bypassed.
    *   The FTP `ftpbounce` keyword may be bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Crafted network traffic that exploits the flawed `MemcmpLowercase` logic. This would involve manipulating headers, filenames, or other data to have specific content that would bypass the incorrect comparison logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that passes through a Suricata instance that uses the vulnerable version of the `MemcmpLowercase` function.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is fixed in Suricata version 2.0.6.
* The issue was tracked in Redmine as issue #1364.
* The Debian bug report is #777523.
