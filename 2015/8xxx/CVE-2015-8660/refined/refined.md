Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8660:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2015-8660. The descriptions from various sources, including Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, and Exploit-DB, all point to the same underlying vulnerability in the Linux kernel's overlayfs module related to incorrect handling of `setattr` operations.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect implementation in the `ovl_setattr` function within the Linux kernel's overlayfs module. The function attempts to optimize or merge distinct `setattr` operations. This merging logic is flawed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect setattr Handling:** The overlayfs module incorrectly merges distinct setattr operations instead of performing them independently, leading to a race condition and improper handling of permissions.
*   **Use-After-Free**: There was also a separate issue where an uninitialised variable in `key_reject_and_link()` could lead to a use-after-free scenario, however this was reported for CVE-2016-4470.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to create files with administrative (root) permission attributes.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can then execute arbitrary code with these elevated privileges, effectively gaining root access to the system.
*   **Denial of Service:**  In the SUSE advisory, there's mention of a related vulnerability, CVE-2013-7446, which could lead to a denial of service (panic), however, that is not the primary vulnerability detailed for CVE-2015-8660.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited locally on the target system. The attacker must have access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Overlayfs Mount:** The attacker needs to create an overlayfs mount to expose the underlying issue.
*   **Crafted setattr Operations:** Specific crafting of `setattr` system calls are needed to create files with specific permission attributes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Unprivileged User:**  The attack can be initiated by an unprivileged user, meaning they do not need prior root access.
*   **Basic system skills:** The attacker needs to know how to create overlayfs mounts and execute commands to trigger the vulnerability, typically requiring scripting or programming skills.

**Additional Information from Content (beyond CVE Description):**

*   **Specific Kernel Versions Affected:** The Ubuntu notices and advisories specify the exact kernel versions that are affected by this flaw (e.g., Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10).
*   **Specific Patches/Packages:** Update instructions are given, including specific package names and versions which fix the vulnerability, as well as details regarding related SUSE security advisories.
*   **Red Hat Specifics:** The Red Hat advisory mentions this vulnerability in the context of a broader kernel security and bug fix update. The advisory also mentions that on s390x (IBM Z) architecture a fork of a process with four page tables will cause memory corruption, which is related to CVE-2016-2143, but was addressed along with this vulnerability.
*  **Exploit Code:** Several sources provide code samples of exploits, including those for the Metasploit framework, demonstrating how this vulnerability can be practically exploited.
*   **Impact:** Many of the resources demonstrate the ease of which a local user can become root.
*   **Mitigation:** Kernel updates are the required mitigation for this vulnerability.
*   **Live Patching:** SUSE also provides details regarding how they are providing live patches for their systems, which are intended to mitigate this vulnerability without requiring a reboot.

In summary, CVE-2015-8660 is a privilege escalation vulnerability due to incorrect handling of `setattr` operations in Linux kernel overlayfs, exploitable by an unprivileged local attacker, and is mitigated by applying kernel updates. The provided content also details specific affected systems and versions, as well as includes code examples demonstrating an attack.
