Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-8856:

**CVE Description:** The content references the following:
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/34>
>
> serve-index package before 1.6.3 for Node.js - XSS
>
> Use CVE-2015-8856.

This indicates that the vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue found in the `serve-index` package for Node.js, specifically in versions prior to 1.6.3.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is not explicitly stated in this document, but it's identified as an XSS vulnerability. Typically, XSS vulnerabilities in web server components like `serve-index` occur due to inadequate sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data when it is reflected in web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - The primary weakness is the lack of proper output sanitization/encoding within the `serve-index` package, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page served by `serve-index`. This could lead to various consequences, including:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - Attackers would likely exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code through request parameters or other user-controlled inputs that are then reflected in the HTML content served by `serve-index`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or requests that include malicious JavaScript code.
  - The attacker needs to find a web server using a vulnerable version of `serve-index` package.
  - The attacker does not need any special privileges or position on the vulnerable system. The attacker would typically interact with the web server as a normal user, but with malicious payloads.

In summary, CVE-2015-8856 is an XSS vulnerability in the `serve-index` package for Node.js. It allows remote attackers to inject malicious scripts into the served content.
