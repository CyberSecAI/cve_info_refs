  "CVE-2015-8821": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within MPEG-4 parsing. A specially crafted MP4 file can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in MPEG-4 parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious MP4 file and host it on a webpage or deliver it to a target user."
