Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in the `png_set_PLTE` and `png_get_PLTE` functions within the libpng library. These functions do not properly validate the maximum palette sizes when dealing with PNG images that have a bit depth less than 8. Specifically, they incorrectly calculated the buffer size, potentially writing more data than allocated

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow condition. The insufficient size calculation can lead to out-of-bounds writes in the palette buffer.
*   **Out-of-bounds read**: `png_convert_to_rfc1123` function has out-of-bounds read when `ptime->month` is 0 due to lack of proper input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause an application crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution**:  In specific scenarios, depending on the context and application utilizing libpng, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by writing malicious data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Information disclosure**: `png_convert_to_rfc1123` function has out-of-bounds read which results in disclosure of process memory

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user or an application to process a maliciously crafted PNG image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a PNG image with a small bit-depth value within the IHDR (image header) chunk.
*   The attacker needs to entice a vulnerable application to process the crafted image.
*   A single user needs to be authenticated to expose the JMX interface

**Additional details from the analyzed content:**

*   The vulnerability primarily impacts applications using libpng's AWT component related to splashscreen displays.
* The vulnerability also impacts JMX comonent related to attribute processing.
* The vulnerability was also found in the JAXP component related to limits.
* The vulnerability was also present in the 2D component related to font actions
* The vulnerability was fixed in libpng 1.0.64, 1.2.54, 1.4.17, 1.5.24, and 1.6.19 (or later versions).
*  The vulnerability was addressed in Oracle Java SE 6u105, 7u91, and 8u66, and Java SE Embedded 8u65
* Several Linux distributions and software packages were affected, including OpenJDK, Chromium, and various SUSE products.
* Some vendors have noted that the severity of this vulnerability is lower when applications allocate the maximum size for the palette, even if they use a vulnerable version of libpng.
* A related CVE, CVE-2015-8472, was assigned when it was discovered that the initial fix was incomplete.
