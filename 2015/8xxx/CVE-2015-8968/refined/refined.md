Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `git fastclone` tool's handling of submodule URLs. Specifically, it allowed the use of the `ext::` protocol in submodule URLs, which could lead to arbitrary command execution. This is because the `ext::` protocol allows git to execute external commands specified in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Protocol Handling:** The primary weakness was the lack of restrictions on the protocols used in submodule URLs. The tool didn't properly sanitize or validate the protocol, allowing the `ext::` protocol.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By using `ext::` protocol, an attacker could embed arbitrary commands in the submodule URL, which would be executed by the git client when it attempts to clone the submodule.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine running `git fastclone` with the privileges of the user running the command. This could have severe consequences, including data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Submodule URLs:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted git repository that includes submodules with malicious URLs using the `ext::` protocol.
*   **Cloning Malicious Repositories:**  A user running `git fastclone` on a repository containing such malicious submodules would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Repository Creation/Modification:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a git repository to include a malicious submodule entry.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker relies on a victim using the vulnerable `git fastclone` tool to clone the repository with the malicious submodule.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that the fix involves restricting the allowed protocols, suggesting that the vulnerability was addressed by implementing a whitelist to prevent the use of the `ext::` protocol.
*   The discussion in the content mentions that `git submodule` had a similar issue and was fixed by introducing a protocol whitelist, which this fix intends to mirror.

**Relationship to CVE-2015-7545:**

The text explicitly states that this issue "Fixes the same issue as CVE-2015-7545". CVE-2015-7545 is a vulnerability in Git itself that allowed arbitrary command execution through submodule URLs using the `ext::` protocol.
Therefore, CVE-2015-8968 is related because it addresses the same underlying vulnerability in a different tool (`git-fastclone`).
