### **[bburky](/bburky)** commented [Dec 13, 2015](#issuecomment-164221760)

| I'd suggest instead setting the 'GIT\_ALLOW\_PROTOCOL' environment variable to 'file:git:http:https:ssh' which should reuse git's newly introduced protocol whitelisting, as done in [git/git@33cfccb](https://github.com/git/git/commit/33cfccbbf35a56e190b79bdec5c85457c952a021). And if the user happens to have GIT\_ALLOW\_PROTOCOL already set in their environment try to preserve it if you can.  You should be able to do that with either `Cocaine::CommandLine.environment['GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL'] = 'file:git:http:https:ssh'` or globally with `ENV['GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL'] = 'file:git:http:https:ssh'`.  The main reason to use a whitelist is that it's more future proof, what if git introduces another strangely behaving protocol in the future? Or what if the user has some other locally installed custom remote helpers installed that can be abused?  Also `git fastclone ext::foo` should still work. All you should be preventing is use of the ext protocol in submodules. That's the new behavior of git-submodule and you probably seem to be trying to match it's behavior. |

| Agree. See [#3](https://github.com/square/git-fastclone/pull/3).  Note: `git fastclone ext::foo` will only work if `ext` is in the whitelist of protocols. Differentiating between the module being cloned and the submodule might require a larger code change. |

| Thanks, I just commented on [#3](https://github.com/square/git-fastclone/pull/3) to say it looks good.  Yes, it seems it might require a significant code change to preserve `git fastclone ext::foo` working. I think this is a very seldom used feature so that's probably fine. I just thought I'd point out that you've diverged from Git's normal behavior a bit. |
