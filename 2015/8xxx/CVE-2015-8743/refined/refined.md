{
  "CVE-2015-8743": {
    "Description": "Qemu emulator built with the NE2000 device emulation support is vulnerable to an OOB r/w access issue. It could occur while performing 'ioport' r/w operations. A privileged(CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user/process could use this flaw to leak or corrupt Qemu memory bytes.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read/write access during ioport operations in the NE2000 device emulation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption or information leak. Potentially leading to denial of service or privilege escalation.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "A privileged (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) user/process"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code with CAP_SYS_RAWIO privileges"
    ],
    "Affected component": "NE2000 network device emulation",
    "Affected product": "QEMU"
  }
