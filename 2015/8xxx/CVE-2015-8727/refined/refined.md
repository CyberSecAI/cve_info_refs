Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error within the `addresses_equal` function, specifically during the processing of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) packets. This function is part of the `dissect_rsvp_common` functionality in Wireshark's dissection engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a UAF, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. In this case, the `addresses_equal` function within the RSVP dissector accesses memory that is no longer valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the UAF can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application, which is a form of denial of service.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, UAF vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits like arbitrary code execution, although this is not confirmed in this case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Network Packets:** The primary attack vector involves injecting a malformed RSVP packet into a network traffic stream being analyzed by Wireshark.
- **Malformed Packet Trace Files:** Another method is to provide Wireshark with a malformed packet trace file that contains the specially crafted RSVP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious packets into the network if Wireshark is actively capturing traffic.
- **Local User:** An attacker might exploit this by getting a target to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Dissector Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides in the RSVP dissector component of Wireshark.
- **Reproducers Available:** There are publicly available reproducer files that can trigger the crash which makes it easier to exploit this vulnerability
- **Multiple Affected Versions**: Versions 2.0.0, and 1.12.0 to 1.12.8 were affected.
- **Fixed Versions**: The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.0.1 and 1.12.9 and later.
- **Vendor Patches**: Patches were issued by Wireshark and also by operating system distributions like Debian
