  "CVE-2015-8920": {
    "root_cause": "While pruning trailing text from ar filenames, the code did not check for an empty filename, resulting in reading a byte before the filename on the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack out-of-bounds read"

    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted AR archive to an application that uses the vulnerable libarchive library to process it."
