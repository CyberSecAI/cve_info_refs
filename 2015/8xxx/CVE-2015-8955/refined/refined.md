Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper validation in the ARM64 performance monitoring unit (PMU) driver within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the driver's `validate_event` function assumed that it could always call `to_arm_pmu(event->pmu)` for any hardware event. However, in scenarios involving event groups that span multiple hardware PMUs (e.g., CPU and CCI), `event->pmu` could refer to a PMU different from the group leader, causing `to_arm_pmu()` to dereference garbage data. This is because the perf core validation happens *after* `pmu::event_init()`, which can be called with a leader from a different PMU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect assumption:** The ARM64 PMU driver incorrectly assumed that `event->pmu` always pointed to the ARM PMU structure when validating event groups.
*   **Missing check for PMU:** The driver lacked a check to ensure that the event belonged to the same PMU as the group leader before calling `to_arm_pmu()`.
*   **Dereferencing garbage data:** Calling `to_arm_pmu` with an incorrect event could lead to dereferencing arbitrary memory locations, causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash. This crash can lead to a denial of service, and in some cases, device instability, as seen in the provided crash log.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the perf subsystem. An attacker can craft a specific perf event setup involving groups that span multiple hardware PMUs (such as CPU and CCI PMUs on ARM64) to trigger the vulnerability. This can be done by using the `perf_event_open` system call with appropriate parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to:

*   Have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   Be able to create perf events (i.e., have the necessary permissions to call `perf_event_open`).
*   Know how to configure perf events and group them in a way that the events would be from different PMUs to trigger the vulnerability.

In the provided crash log it is triggered by `perf_fuzzer`.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided commit log and diff highlight the fix:
*   The patch adds a check to `validate_event` function to explicitly reject events that belong to a different PMU than the current one, before any attempt to call `to_arm_pmu`.
*   The patch also moves the `to_arm_pmu` and related logic inside the conditional block, so it's executed only if the check passes.
*   The `validate_group` function was also modified to pass the `event->pmu` parameter to `validate_event` function to ensure the checks are valid.
