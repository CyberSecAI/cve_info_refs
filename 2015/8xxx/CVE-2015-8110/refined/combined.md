IOActive Security Advisory

Title

Severity

TVSUkernel Escalation of Privileges

Critical

Discovered by

Sofiane Talmat

Advisory Date

November 19, 2015

CVE

CVE-2015-8110

Affected Products

Lenovo System Update (Discovered in version 5.07.0013)

Impact

This vulnerability allows a local unprivileged user to run commands as the Windows
SYSTEM user.

Background

The Lenovo System Update allows least-privileged users to perform system updates. To do
this, System Update includes the System Update service (SUService.exe). This service runs
as the privileged SYSTEM user, creates a temporary user account with Administrator
privileges, and starts a GUI application (Tvsukernel.exe) with the new Administrator
account. Once the application is closed, the temporary Administrator account is
appropriately deleted. However the GUI application contains links to online support and
privacy help topics, which, when clicked, start a web browser instance under the temporary
Administrator account to display the online topic.

As a result, an attacker who is unprivileged can exploit the web browser instance that is
running as Administrator to elevate his or her own privileges to Administrator or SYSTEM.

Technical Details

IOActive executed the following steps to create a Proof of Concept:

1-  Start the Lenovo System Update application.

© 2015 IOActive, Inc. All Rights Reserved  [1]

2-  Click one of two following links to allow the execution of a web browser with

Administrator privileges:

a.   “Click here to learn more” link on the main window

b.  The Help icon

 at top right > Settings > View Privacy Policy link

© 2015 IOActive, Inc. All Rights Reserved  [2]

3-  Next, an instance of the web browser will run as Administrator.

4-  Elevate the attacker’s privileges to Administrator and SYSTEM through the web

navigator instance that is running as Administrator.

Fixes

Install the latest version of the Lenovo System Update application (version 5.06.0043 or
higher), which is available through System Update.

Lenovo also has issued an advisory about this vulnerability:
https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/lsu_privilege.

Timeline

October 2015 – IOActive discovers the privilege escalation vulnerability

November 2, 2015 – IOActive reports it to Lenovo

November 19, 2015 – Lenovo releases a fix and advisory
