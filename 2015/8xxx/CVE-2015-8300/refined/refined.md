Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Polycom BToE Connector service (plcmbtoesrv.exe) runs with SYSTEM privileges.
*   The default installation of the software allows any user to replace the `plcmbtoesrv.exe` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core vulnerability lies in the insecure file permissions on the `plcmbtoesrv.exe` file within the Polycom BToE Connector installation directory. This allows any local user to overwrite this executable.
*   **Privileged Service:** The vulnerable service executes with SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by replacing the `plcmbtoesrv.exe` with their malicious executable. This gives the attacker full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable Polycom BToE Connector is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the Windows system, even one with very limited privileges.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the Polycom BToE Connector installation directory to replace the service executable.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic case of local privilege escalation due to insecure file permissions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain complete control of a system running the vulnerable software.
