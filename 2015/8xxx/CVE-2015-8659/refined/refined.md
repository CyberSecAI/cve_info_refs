Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8659:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free bug.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is specifically located in the idle stream handling code within the nghttp2 library. This means the vulnerability is triggered when the code interacts with HTTP/2 streams that are in an idle state, where the memory is accessed after being freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The most serious impact was the possibility of remote code execution. However, other impacts are not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by network traffic interacting with the vulnerable nghttp2 library, specifically in the handling of HTTP/2 streams, allowing remote attackers to exploit the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A remote attacker is able to trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP/2 requests that expose the weakness in idle stream handling code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in nghttp2 version 1.6.0.
- Multiple vendors, such as Apple, were affected due to their utilization of the nghttp2 library, and released updates that included the patched version of nghttp2. The affected Apple products include watchOS 2.2, iOS 9.3, tvOS 9.2 and OS X El Capitan 10.11.4.
- The vulnerability was considered serious due to nghttp2's widespread use in HTTP/2 deployments.
