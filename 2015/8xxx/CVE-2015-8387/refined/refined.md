Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library. Specifically, the provided text references multiple vulnerabilities fixed in PCRE version 8.38, including heap overflows and stack overflows related to `compile_regex` and `pcre_exec` functions. CVE-2015-8387 is one of them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:**  A heap overflow vulnerability exists within the `pcre_exec` function.
*   **Other vulnerabilities:** The advisory also mentions other related issues like stack overflows and heap overflows in `compile_regex` which might contribute to the overall risk profile, though not specific to this CVE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  The advisory indicates potential for disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Data Modification:**  The advisory also indicates potential for data modification.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The Gentoo security advisory indicates that exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves providing a specially crafted regular expression to the vulnerable PCRE library.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates this vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious regular expression to a vulnerable application that uses the affected version of PCRE.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges as it's exploitable with no required privileges based on the provided CVSS score.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The openwall.com content suggests that the practical value of CVE IDs for PCRE vulnerabilities might be limited since they often require the attacker to supply an arbitrary regular expression, which is not a common scenario in many applications. However, the netapp advisory shows that in some products, this scenario is possible.
*   The Gentoo advisory indicates that this vulnerability is remotely exploitable, making it more concerning.
*   The NetApp advisory specifies that the NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller is affected, while other NetApp products are not.
*   The NetApp advisory states that there are "no plans to address this vulnerability" for the affected products, due to an End-of-Availability (EOA) announcement.

In summary, CVE-2015-8387 is a heap overflow vulnerability within the PCRE library that can be triggered by a malicious regular expression, potentially leading to DoS, information disclosure, data modification or code execution.
