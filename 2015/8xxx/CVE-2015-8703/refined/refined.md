The provided content is related to CVE-2015-8703 as it describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting ZTE routers, which are assigned CVEs in the range of CVE-2015-7248 to CVE-2015-7252. However, this CVE ID itself is a placeholder. The vulnerabilities mentioned are:

**CVE-2015-7248 (CWE-200): Information Exposure**
*   **Root cause:**  Usernames and password hashes are exposed in the page source, and the device configuration file contains sensitive information in plaintext.
*   **Weakness:** Information exposure due to insecure storage and handling of credentials.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can gain access to usernames, password hashes, and other sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vector:** By accessing the web interface of the router via `http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc` and viewing page source or by accessing the configuration file with lower-level user access.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** A local attacker with network access to the device.

**CVE-2015-7249 (CWE-285): Improper Authorization**
*   **Root cause:** Client-side request parameters can be manipulated to authenticate as other existing accounts.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization checks on client-side requests.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass authentication and perform actions with the privileges of other users (e.g., changing passwords).
*   **Attack vector:** By manipulating parameters in client-side requests to the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** A local attacker with network access to the device.

**CVE-2015-7250 (CWE-22): Path Traversal**
*   **Root cause:** The `getpage` parameter in the `webproc` cgi module allows unrestricted file paths.
*   **Weakness:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.
*  **Attack vector:** By providing a crafted `getpage` parameter to the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** A local attacker with network access to the device.

**CVE-2015-7251 (CWE-798): Use of Hard-coded Credentials**
*   **Root cause:** The Telnet service uses hard-coded credentials ('root'/'root').
*   **Weakness:** Use of hardcoded credentials.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain Telnet access using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Attack vector:** By enabling and connecting to the Telnet service with the hardcoded credentials.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** A local attacker with network access to the device.

**CVE-2015-7252 (CWE-79): Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root cause:** The `errorpage` parameter in the `webproc` cgi module is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious link with a payload in the `errorpage` parameter of the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** A local attacker with network access to the device.

The document states that these vulnerabilities can lead to a LAN-based attacker gaining complete control of affected devices and also mentions that in some configurations, an external attacker could exploit these issues. The provided solution is to apply the vendor's update or discontinue use of the affected devices. The base CVSS score is 8.3.
