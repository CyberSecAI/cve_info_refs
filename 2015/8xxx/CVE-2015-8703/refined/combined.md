## ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A routers contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#391604

Original Release Date: 2015-11-03 | Last Revised: 2015-11-04

---

### Overview

ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router, version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.h\_PE, and ZXV10 W300 router, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE, contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-200**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure** - CVE-2015-7248  Multiple information exposure vulnerabilities enable an attacker to obtain credentials and other sensitive details about the ZXHN H108N R1A.   1. User names and password hashes can be viewed in the page source of http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc 2. The configuration file of the device contains usernames, passwords, keys, and other values in plain text, which can be used by a user with lower privileges to gain admin account access. This issue also affects ZTE ZXV10 W300 models, version W300V1.0.0f\_ER1\_PE.  [**CWE-285**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)**: Improper Authorization** - CVE-2015-7249 By default, only admin may authenticate directly with the web administration pages in the ZXHN H108N R1A. By manipulating parameters in client-side requests, an attacker may authenticate as another existing account, such as user or support, and may be able to perform actions otherwise not allowed. For instance, while authenticated as support, directly accessing http://<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html&var:menu=maintenance&var:page=accessctrl&var:subpage=accountpsd permits changing the password of user.[**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2015-7250The webproc cgi module of the ZXHN H108N R1A accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.[**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - CVE-2015-7251In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the Telnet service, when enabled, is accessible using the hard-coded credentials 'root' for both the username and password.[**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2015-7252In the ZXHN H108N R1A, the errorpage parameter of the webproc cgi module is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A LAN-based attacker can obtain credentials and configuration information, bypass authentication, access arbitrary files, and gain complete control of affected devices. Note that in some configurations, an external attacker may be able to leverage these vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has issued ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE to address the vulnerabilities affecting ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A. Users are encouraged to contact their Internet service provider for updates.Note that W300 models are no longer officially supported and will not be receiving any updates. Users should consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Discontinue use**ZTE states:*The vulnerable W300 router was officially replaced by H108N V2.1 released in July 2014, and the vulnerable H108N was finished upgrading to version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.k\_PE through operator channel that all the vulnerabilities mentioned herein were fixed. ZTE recommends users to contact local operators for upgrade service.*Since patches will not be issued to address vulnerabilities in W300 routers, users should strongly consider discontinuing use of affected devices. Users of ISP-provisioned W300 devices should request replacement routers. |
