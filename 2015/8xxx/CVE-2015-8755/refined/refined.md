Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly encode user input in several backend components of TYPO3 CMS. This lack of encoding allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The specific vulnerability is that user-supplied input isn't properly sanitized or escaped before being output in the web page, which allows the injection of malicious scripts.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the backend. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including but not limited to: session hijacking, defacement, and phishing attacks. Since it's in the backend, the impact would be on administrators and content editors.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the TYPO3 backend where authenticated editors can inject malicious code via input fields that are not properly encoded
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with editing privileges within the TYPO3 backend. The attacker needs to be in a position where they can input data into the vulnerable input fields.

**Affected Versions:** TYPO3 CMS versions 6.2.0 to 6.2.15 and 7.0.0 to 7.6.0

**Solution:** Upgrade to TYPO3 versions 6.2.16 or 7.6.1, which contain the fix for this vulnerability.
