- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper bounds checking in server command processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with system privileges or cause the application to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack by sending specially crafted commands to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. No prior authentication or privileges are required.
