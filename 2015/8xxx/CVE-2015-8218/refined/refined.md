Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `decode_uncompressed` function located in `libavcodec/faxcompr.c` of FFmpeg. This function fails to properly validate uncompressed runs within CCITT FAX data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of validation for the length of uncompressed data runs. Specifically, the `decode_uncompressed` function doesn't check if the specified run lengths are within the bounds of allocated buffers before accessing them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The out-of-bounds array access can crash the application and potentially cause other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the processing of crafted CCITT FAX data. A malicious actor would need to create a specially crafted fax file containing manipulated run lengths to trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to provide or have the vulnerable ffmpeg library process the crafted CCITT FAX data file. This could be through various means such as embedding the malicious data in a file uploaded through a website, email, or any other application that uses ffmpeg.

In summary, the vulnerability results from a missing bounds check when processing uncompressed data runs within CCITT FAX data, potentially leading to a denial of service by causing an out of bounds memory access.
