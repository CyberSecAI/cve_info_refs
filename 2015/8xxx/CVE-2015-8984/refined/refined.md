{
  "CVE-2015-8984": {
    "root_cause": "The `fnmatch` function in glibc, when processing certain malformed patterns, can skip over the NUL byte that terminates the pattern.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Overread",
      "Potential application crash"
    ],
    "impact": "An application crash can occur if `fnmatch` continues reading past the end of the pattern and hits an unmapped memory page before encountering a NUL byte.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted, malformed pattern to the `fnmatch` function.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control the input to the `fnmatch` function, specifically the pattern being matched."
