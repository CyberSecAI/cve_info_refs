Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8346:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to an information disclosure vulnerability in Redmine's time logging form. The vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to potentially view the subjects of issues that they do not have permission to see.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the time logging form was displaying issue information without properly checking if the current user had permissions to view the related issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of issue subjects to users who should not have access to them. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Access:** An attacker could potentially learn about project details that should be kept confidential from them based on access control settings.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The vulnerability could expose sensitive issue details to users who are not supposed to view them.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Time Logging Form:** The vulnerability is present in the Redmine time logging form. An attacker with the ability to access this form could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Redmine User Account:** The attacker needs a Redmine user account that has access to the time logging form.
*   **Knowledge of Project IDs:** An attacker may need to know project IDs.
*   **Basic understanding of Redmine's interface** to navigate to the time logging form.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves adding a `try(:visible?)` check before displaying issue information, ensuring that the subject is only shown if the current user has the necessary permissions.
*   This vulnerability was addressed in Redmine versions 3.1.2, 3.0.6, and 2.6.8.
*   Debian issued DSA-3529-1 to address this and other Redmine vulnerabilities, updating the redmine package to version 3.0~20140825-8~deb8u2 for the stable distribution (jessie).
