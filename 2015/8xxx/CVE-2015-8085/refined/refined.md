  "CVE-2015-8085": {
    "description": "Some Huawei products have two information leak vulnerabilities caused by improper encryption mechanisms.\nUsers can use reversible or irreversible encryption algorithms to encrypt passwords. If a reversible encryption algorithm is used to encrypt administrators' passwords, an attacker with high administrative privileges can log in to the device, obtain the ciphertext password of a higher-level administrator, and crack it to get elevated privileges. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2015-06073)\nThis vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2015-8085.",
    "root_cause": "Improper encryption mechanisms.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of reversible encryption algorithms for administrator passwords",
      "Storage of encryption keys within the system."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with high administrative privileges can obtain the ciphertext password of a higher-level administrator, and crack it to get elevated privileges and obtain plaintext passwords, leading to user information leaks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access and high administrative privileges on the affected device."
