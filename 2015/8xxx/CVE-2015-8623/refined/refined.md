Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant-time string comparison in the `User::matchEditToken` function within MediaWiki, specifically before the actual constant-time comparison using `hash_equals`. This initial string comparison leaks timing information that can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The use of `!=` (non-constant time string comparison) before `hash_equals` exposes a timing side channel. The time it takes for the comparison to complete can vary based on the position of the first differing character in the string, allowing an attacker to potentially deduce information about the token.
- **Broken Session Data**: The `wfDebug` message is triggered before the constant time comparison.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially use the timing difference to infer information about the edit token used in MediaWiki.  This might lead to the ability to bypass CSRF protection.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a timing attack on the edit token comparison in `User::matchEditToken`. This involves sending requests with various tokens and measuring the response time.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the MediaWiki instance where the vulnerable code exists.
- The attacker must have a means of measuring the response times of their requests, which might require some level of precision.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found during an internal review.
- The fix uses `hash_equals` for the initial check, ensuring constant-time comparison throughout the function, thereby preventing the timing attack.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-208 (Information Exposure Through Timing).
- The fix was implemented in multiple branches of MediaWiki (1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and master).
