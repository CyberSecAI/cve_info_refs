Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the DNS dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the dissector improperly handles the DNS Client Subnet option when the data length associated with it is excessively long. It ignores the specified data length, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The DNS dissector fails to properly validate the data length of the DNS Client Subnet option. It does not check if the provided length is within reasonable bounds or consistent with the actual packet data.
- **Memory Corruption:** By ignoring the specified length, the dissector might try to read past the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. This can be achieved by injecting a malformed DNS packet with an overly long Client Subnet option on the network or by opening a capture file containing such a packet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted DNS packet with an oversized Client Subnet option into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious packet capture (pcap) file containing such a packet and trick a user into opening it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access (for network injection):** An attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic or be in a position to intercept and modify traffic.
- **Social Engineering/User Interaction (for malicious pcap):** An attacker can trick the victim into opening a specially crafted pcap file containing the malicious DNS data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was discovered by Boaz Brickner.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.8.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark version 1.12.9.
- The vulnerability is also referred to as "wnpa-sec-2015-38".
