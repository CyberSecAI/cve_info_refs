Technique Details

HWPSIRT-2015-08043

Prerequisite:

1. The attacker can access the TE through Wi-Fi;

Attacking procedure:

An attacker can access the product through Wi-Fi to trigger abnormal processing of wireless presentation in specific scenarios. The TE product does not implement effective permission control over the sending and receiving of presentation. As a result, the sending of wired presentation in use stops, affecting normal services.

HWPSIRT-2015-10002

Prerequisite:

1. A user logs in to the PC successfully using the Debug account;.
2. The attacker can approach and perform operations on the PC;

Attacking procedure:

A user logs in to a PC using the Debug account and leaves the PC. The TE product does not verify the old password of the Debug account during password change operations.
