The provided content is related to CVE-2015-8672.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the presentation sending/receiving permission management mechanism of Huawei TE series products. Specifically, the TE product does not effectively control the permission for sending and receiving presentations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient permission control for wired and wireless presentations. This allows an attacker to disrupt the presentation process by triggering abnormal processing of wireless presentations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can halt the ongoing wired presentation, causing service disruption. The wired presentation in use stops which affects normal services

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to access the Huawei TE device through Wi-Fi.
The attacker then triggers abnormal processing of wireless presentations in specific scenarios.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the same Wi-Fi network as the Huawei TE device.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger abnormal wireless presentation processing.
