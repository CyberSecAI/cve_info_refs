Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `index_urlfetch` function of Cyrus IMAP. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the range checking code, where an integer overflow can occur during the calculation of the size of the data to be fetched within an email message. This overflow is triggered by a specific way of handling `start_octet` within the urlfetch function, leading to incorrect bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is an integer overflow during the calculation of the range of bytes to fetch from an email message.
- **Incomplete Fix:** This vulnerability stems from a prior, incomplete fix for CVE-2015-8076.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** As a result of the overflow, there can be out-of-bounds read, which can result in information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  The primary impact is that a remote attacker could potentially read data beyond the intended message boundaries via a crafted urlfetch range, leading to information disclosure
- **Unspecified Impact:** The CVE description also mentions "unspecified other impact" due to the nature of heap reads, but it does not elaborate any further.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, where a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Cyrus IMAP server, which involves the `urlfetch` function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Cyrus IMAP server.
- **Ability to trigger urlfetch:** The attacker has to have ability to trigger the vulnerable `urlfetch` function.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs because of an incomplete fix for a previous CVE (CVE-2015-8076), as per the provided description.
- The vulnerability exists in Cyrus IMAP versions 2.3.x before 2.3.19, 2.4.x before 2.4.18, and 2.5.x before 2.5.4.
- Patches for this vulnerability involve modifications to the way Cyrus IMAP handles the `start_octet` variable in range checks of `urlfetch` function.

The provided information also mentions that the fix for CVE-2015-8077 was released alongside fixes for CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2015-8076 and CVE-2015-8078 as part of the same security updates.
