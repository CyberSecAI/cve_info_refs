{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A custom string copy function within Flexera's FlexNet Publisher (lmgrd) does not perform proper bounds checking. Specifically, the function ignores the length parameter, effectively converting it into a 'strcpy' operation, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow if the source buffer exceeds the destination buffer's size.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges due to the stack buffer overflow. This can also lead to disruption of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks using specially crafted messages sent to the vulnerable FlexNet Publisher service (lmgrd) or custom vendor daemons.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "memory_protections": "The vulnerable binary was compiled with ASLR, DEP, and SafeSEH, however, these protections were bypassed by the exploit.",
    "exploitation_details": "The exploit leverages a specific message parsing function (0x107) that lacks a stack cookie and overwrites the return pointer with a ROP gadget to redirect execution to the attacker-controlled buffer. Since address randomization (ASLR) is enabled, the exploit uses a brute force technique to guess the base address of the required library where ROP gadgets exist by restarting the vendor service (controlled by lmgrd) until a successful guess. DEP is bypassed using ROP gadgets from the current binary to enable an executable stack."
