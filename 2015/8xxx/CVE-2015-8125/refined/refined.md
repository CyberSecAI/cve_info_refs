Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a potential remote timing attack in the `Symfony\Component\Security\Http\RememberMe\PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices` class, `Symfony\Component\Security\Http\Firewall\DigestAuthenticationListener` class, and the legacy CSRF implementation from the Symfony Form component (`Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Csrf\CsrfProvider\DefaultCsrfProvider`).
*   The issue is related to how these components were performing string comparisons, which could potentially reveal information about the compared strings to an attacker by timing the operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The vulnerability is a timing attack, where an attacker can infer information by observing the time it takes for a comparison operation to complete. This occurs because the vulnerable code did not use a constant-time comparison method when checking tokens or similar values.
*   **Insecure String Comparison:** The use of insecure string comparison methods (likely not constant-time) in security-sensitive operations allowed the timing attack to be effective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain information about the structure or the value of the tokens by exploiting the timing differences, allowing them to craft valid tokens and potentially gain unauthorized access.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Specifically, the remember-me service was vulnerable. By timing the token comparison, an attacker could potentially craft a valid remember-me token and impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **CSRF bypass:** The legacy CSRF implementation was also vulnerable, which could lead to an attacker crafting valid CSRF tokens and making malicious requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This is a remote vulnerability, meaning the attacker can exploit it over a network.
*   **Network Timing:** The attack is performed by sending requests to the vulnerable server and measuring the time taken for responses.
*   **Targeted Components:** The attack targets specific classes within the Symfony framework:
    *   `PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices` (Remember-Me Service)
    *   `DigestAuthenticationListener` (Digest Authentication)
    *    `DefaultCsrfProvider` (Legacy CSRF)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the server.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs the ability to accurately measure the time taken for the server to respond to requests.
*   **Knowledge of Affected Components:** The attacker needs to know that the server is using a vulnerable version of Symfony with the vulnerable components.
*   **Repetitive Requests:** An attacker would likely need to perform many requests to accurately measure timing differences.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by using `hash_equals()` (or `StringUtils::equals()` as a fallback), which performs constant-time string comparison, preventing timing attacks. The `symfony/polyfill-php56` package is recommended for PHP versions that do not natively support `hash_equals()`.
*   **Affected Versions:** Symfony versions 2.3.0 to 2.3.34, 2.6.0 - 2.6.11, and 2.7.0 - 2.7.6 were affected.  Symfony 2.3.35, 2.6.12, and 2.7.7 contain the fix.
