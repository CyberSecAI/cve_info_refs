Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-8275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way "eParakstitajs 3.0" (1.3.0) and "edoc-libraries-2.5.4\_01" process EDOC files. By creating specifically crafted EDOC files, an attacker can manipulate the software into writing arbitrary files to the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary file write vulnerability
- Improper input validation or sanitization when processing EDOC files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can write arbitrary files to the filesystem. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Overwriting system files, potentially leading to system compromise.
    - Writing malicious executables, enabling code execution.
    - Data tampering or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafting a malicious EDOC file.
- The crafted EDOC file is then processed by the vulnerable software, "eParakstitajs 3.0" or "edoc-libraries-2.5.4\_01".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted EDOC file.
- The attacker needs to get the user to process the crafted EDOC file with the vulnerable software.
