Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8288:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of hard-coded cryptographic keys within the firmware of Netgear D6000 and D3600 routers. Specifically, this includes a hard-coded RSA private key, along with an X.509 certificate and key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-321:** Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key. The devices contain a hard-coded RSA private key and X.509 certificate/key pair in their firmware.
- This vulnerability is paired with another one, **CWE-288** (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) which, though related to a different CVE (CVE-2015-8289) is part of the same vulnerability note. The authentication bypass allows viewing the administrator password in clear text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded keys can gain administrator access to the device.
- The attacker can implement man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting and potentially modifying traffic between the router and connected devices.
- An attacker can decrypt passively captured network packets, exposing sensitive information.
- Combined with CVE-2015-8289, an attacker could obtain the administrator password in clear text and then use the hard-coded credentials for administrative access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they have network access to the router, either through the local network or, if enabled, via remote management.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the hard-coded cryptographic keys.
- The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Netgear device.
- For the related authentication bypass (CVE-2015-8289), the attacker needs to access the `/cgi-bin/passrec.asp` page.

**Affected Devices:**
- Netgear D6000 and D3600 routers
- Firmware versions 1.0.0.47 and 1.0.0.49, and earlier versions

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content confirms the vulnerability, its impact, and the affected devices.
- It also states that Netgear released a firmware update (v1.0.0.59) to address the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mandar Jadhav of Qualys.
