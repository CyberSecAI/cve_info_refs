# CVE-2015-8288 - Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

NETGEAR is aware of a security vulnerability associated with the https certificate and private keys for modem routers. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can access the internal network or when remote management is enabled on the router.

This software vulnerability affects only certain NETGEAR devices that use the following firmware versions:

* D3600 v1.0.0.49
* D6000 v1.0.0.49 or earlier

To prevent the issue, NETGEAR strongly recommends that you download firmware v1.0.0.59 that updates the certificate and private keys. Click the product link to download firmware v.1.0.0.59.

* <https://www.netgear.com/support/product/D3600.aspx>
* <http://www.netgear.com/support/product/D6000.aspx>

The updated firmware will minimize vulnerability to remote attacks. If you do not update to firmware v1.0.0.59, attackers might be able to carry out impersonation, man-in-the-middle, or passive decryption attacks, resulting in sensitive information exposure. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequence that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.
