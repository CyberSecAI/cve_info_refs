Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `libraries/config/messages.inc.php` file of phpMyAdmin.
- It's triggered when phpMyAdmin is called in an unexpected manner, causing PHP to generate an error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The PHP error message reveals the full path to the directory where phpMyAdmin is installed. This path disclosure vulnerability could expose sensitive system information to an attacker.
- The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient error handling within the affected phpMyAdmin versions which leads to displaying the full server path in error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure and the specific location where phpMyAdmin is hosted. This could potentially be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the attack involves sending crafted HTTP requests to trigger the error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
- **No Authentication:** The attack doesn't require prior authentication; it can be triggered by sending specifically crafted requests.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x before 4.0.10.12, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.2, and 4.5.x before 4.5.3.1 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to the fixed versions of phpMyAdmin or by disabling the PHP configuration directive `display_errors`.
- **Severity:** While the vulnerability is considered moderate, it's important to address it due to the potential for information disclosure.
