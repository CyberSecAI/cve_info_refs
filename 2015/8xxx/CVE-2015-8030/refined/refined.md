The provided content contains multiple advisories related to CVE-2015-8030, all affecting SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. Each advisory describes a similar vulnerability but for different file formats.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to validate index values against the bounds of allocated arrays when processing specific file formats.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Out-of-bounds indexing vulnerability in the handling of U3D, FBX, JPEG2000 and LWO file formats.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious user crafting a malformed file of a specific type (U3D, FBX, JPEG2000, or LWO). The targeted user must either open this file or visit a malicious page that triggers the processing of such file by the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious file to a user running the affected software. This can be achieved by either delivering the malicious file directly or hosting it on a webpage that the user is likely to visit. User interaction is required, as the target needs to open the malicious file or visit the malicious web page.
