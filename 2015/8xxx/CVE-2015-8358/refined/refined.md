Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `work[]` HTTP POST parameter within the `/bitrix/admin/bitrix.mpbuilder_step2.php` script. This lack of proper filtering allows an attacker to manipulate the parameter and inject arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion, where the attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `work[]` parameter.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`work[]` parameter) before using it in a PHP `include()` function.
*   **CSRF Vector:** Although administrative privileges are required to access the vulnerable module, the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server process.
*   **Complete Control of Website:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control over the website. They could potentially read sensitive data, modify files, inject malicious content, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **System Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary system commands using techniques such as including a session file containing malicious PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/bitrix/admin/bitrix.mpbuilder_step2.php` script.
*  **Manipulation of `work[]` parameter:** The attacker modifies the `work[]` parameter to include a path to a malicious file.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The attacker can use CSRF to make the vulnerable request on behalf of an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess paths to local files on the server, which could include session files.
*   **CSRF Exploit Creation:** To bypass the need for administrative access, the attacker must craft a CSRF attack.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content also mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.12 of the `bitrix.mpbuilder` module.
* The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 9.6, which is classified as "Critical."
* The advisory details that an attacker can include and execute a file like `/tmp/file` using the vulnerable parameter `work[]`.
* It also describes how to execute arbitrary PHP using a previously crafted session file. The attacker can change a user profile name to something like `<?php exec($_POST['cmd']); ?>`, then use a CSRF exploit that includes that session file and pass it a command like `ls`.
