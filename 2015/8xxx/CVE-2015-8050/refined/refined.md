  "CVE-2015-8050": {
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the MovieClip object implementation in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.268 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.554 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.204, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted beginGradientFill call",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the `MovieClip.beginGradientFill` method, where a MovieClip-related object in memory can be reused after it has been freed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash, under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file containing a crafted `beginGradientFill` call."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file with a crafted `beginGradientFill` call. No authentication is required."
  }
