Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a static out-of-bounds read within the ZigBee ZCL dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `dissect_zcl_pwr_prof_pwrprofstatersp` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The dissector attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash. This is due to the dissector not properly validating the input, resulting in the function accessing memory locations that it should not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This can be achieved by injecting a malformed ZigBee packet onto the wire or by opening a malicious capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network injection:** A malicious actor could inject a crafted ZigBee packet into a network being monitored by Wireshark.
- **Malicious capture files:** A user could be tricked into opening a specially crafted packet capture file (.pcap) containing the malicious ZigBee data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject network packets on a network being monitored or convince a user to open a malicious capture file.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker only needs to be in a position where they can send the malicious packets to be captured by a vulnerable wireshark instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions 2.0.0 and 1.12.0 to 1.12.8 of Wireshark.
- The fix was implemented in versions 2.0.1 and 1.12.9.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `dissect_zcl_pwr_prof_pwrprofstatersp` function, which is responsible for parsing ZigBee ZCL power profile status response data.

The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is a remote DoS, triggered by malformed ZigBee packets. The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash of Wireshark.
