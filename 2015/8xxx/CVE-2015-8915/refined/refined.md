Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by an invalid memory read in the CPIO parser within the libarchive library. Specifically, it occurs when the parser hits the end-of-file while attempting to read a CPIO header. This leads to an attempt to access memory that is not valid, resulting in a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Read:** The primary weakness is an attempt to read from an invalid memory location due to improper handling of end-of-file conditions during CPIO header parsing.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The CPIO parser does not properly validate the input data or handle cases where the end-of-file is reached prematurely when expecting a full header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the application using libarchive (e.g., bsdcpio or bsdtar). This can cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Archive File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted CPIO archive file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by libarchive.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user or application attempts to read or extract the crafted CPIO archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a CPIO archive file.
*   **File Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the crafted archive file to a system that will process it using a vulnerable version of libarchive. This could involve social engineering or other methods to trick a user into opening the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
* The issue was initially reported in Google Code issue tracker for libarchive as issue 395, and later migrated to GitHub as issue 503.
* The vulnerability was fixed in libarchive version 3.2.0, which was released on April 30th.
* Debian LTS released a fix in libarchive version 3.1.2-11+deb8u4.

This CVE is one of multiple vulnerabilities that were discovered and fixed in libarchive, highlighting the importance of proper input validation and error handling.
