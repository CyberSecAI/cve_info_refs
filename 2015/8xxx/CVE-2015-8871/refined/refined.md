Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the `opj_j2k_write_mco` function within the `j2k.c` file of the OpenJPEG library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Use-After-Free:** The code modifies `p_j2k->m_specific_param.m_encoder.m_header_tile_data` via `realloc`, which can free the original memory. However, a pointer to the old memory location is still held by the variable  `l_current_data`, which is then used later, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
    
**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary code execution:** By exploiting the use-after-free, a crafted JPEG 2000 file can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the system processing the image.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability may also cause a denial of service by crashing the application due to an invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Maliciously Crafted JPEG 2000 File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious JPEG 2000 file that, when processed by the vulnerable OpenJPEG library, triggers the use-after-free condition.
-   **Remote Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to open such a crafted JPEG 2000 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Craft a Malicious JPEG 2000 File:** An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability.
-   **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs to make the user process the crafted image to trigger the vulnerability. This may involve sending a crafted image via email, hosting it on a website or any other method that would lead to the processing of this crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in OpenJPEG version 2.1.1.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2015-8871.
- Various distributions (e.g., Debian, Fedora, Gentoo) have released security updates to address this vulnerability in their respective OpenJPEG packages.
