The following entry is relevant to CVE-2015-8978:

```
1.15 July 21, 2015
    + Preventing "billion laughs" exponential entity expansion attack [github/thilo-fester]
```

Based on this changelog entry:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The module was vulnerable to the "billion laughs" attack, which exploits exponential entity expansion in XML parsing.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the way the XML parser within the `SOAP::Lite` module handles XML entities, specifically allowing recursive definitions leading to exponential growth when processed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful "billion laughs" attack could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive resource consumption (memory and CPU) on the server processing the SOAP messages.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted SOAP messages containing specially constructed XML entities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to send SOAP messages to a service using the vulnerable `SOAP::Lite` module. This could be through a client application or a web service endpoint. The attacker does not require any special capabilities beyond the ability to send HTTP requests with XML payloads.
