Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error within the S7COMM dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `s7comm_decode_ud_cpu_szl_subfunc` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero error. This occurs when the divisor in a division operation is zero, leading to a program crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can trigger the crash by injecting a crafted, malformed packet or by providing a malformed packet trace file to Wireshark. This results in the application crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed network packets: An attacker could inject specially crafted S7COMM packets onto the network that are processed by Wireshark.
- Malformed capture files: An attacker can provide a malformed capture file to a Wireshark user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject packets into a network that is monitored by Wireshark or the ability to make the victim open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark version 2.0.0 and was fixed in version 2.0.1.
- The provided information includes links to the original bug report and sample capture files that can be used to reproduce the issue.
