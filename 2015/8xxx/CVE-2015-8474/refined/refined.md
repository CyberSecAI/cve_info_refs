Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8474:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-8474 within a Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3529-1) related to Redmine. The advisory states, "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Redmine, a project management web application, which may result in information disclosure."  This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE. The content also mentions that this vulnerability is related to an open redirect vulnerability in Redmine.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an insufficient validation of the `back_url` parameter in Redmine's `redirect_back_or_default` method. The `valid_back_url?` method, responsible for ensuring the redirect target is valid, failed to properly sanitize or validate the provided URL, leading to an open redirect.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, which allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The `valid_back_url?` method lacked sufficient input sanitization or validation logic which allowed for bypass. Specifically, it did not properly handle cases with the `@` symbol, `..`, or `//` in the URL. It also did not properly handle URLs with user info.
- **Bypass of URL Validation:** The validation method could be bypassed using crafted URLs such as `http://redmine.example.com/login?back_url=@attacker.com` which would result in a redirect to `http://attacker.com` with basic auth `redmine.example.com`
- **Lack of Strict URL Protocol Enforcement:** The initial URL verification did not enforce strict URL protocols, allowing relative paths and other forms of potentially malicious URLs to pass through the validation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to phishing attacks, where users are redirected to malicious websites designed to steal their credentials or other sensitive information. Because the modified link appears to be associated with the original site the phishing attempts appear more trustworthy.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to sites hosting malware or exploit kits.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **`back_url` parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `back_url` parameter in Redmine URLs, such as during login.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to craft URLs with malicious `back_url` parameters and get users to click on them (e.g. through emails, or links on other websites).
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require prior authentication to Redmine to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Basic Knowledge of Web Attacks:** Attackers need basic understanding of how open redirect vulnerabilities can be used in malicious attacks.

**Additional Notes from the content:**

- The vulnerability was addressed with a patch that refactors the `valid_back_url?` method to `validate_back_url`.
- The patch was applied to Redmine versions 2.5, 2.6, and 3.0
- The Redmine team also considered using signed URLs to prevent tampering but ultimately went with strict input sanitization of the URL, while also leaving the back_url param as clear text for users.
- The fix included changes to the `application_controller.rb` file. The fix was also tested in `account_controller_test.rb`.
- The issue was tracked as #19577.
