Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow within the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer when handling specially crafted Flic animation documents or 3DM files. Specifically:
  - For Flic files, a crafted document can trigger a heap buffer overflow.
  - For 3DM files, the software fails to validate a length value within the file before using it in a call to `fread`, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: Occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.
- Insufficient input validation: The software fails to properly validate the length of data read from the Flic or 3DM files which leads to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious files: An attacker crafts a malicious Flic animation or 3DM file.
- User interaction: The target user must open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that loads the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver or lure the target into opening/loading the malicious file.
- No specific privileges are mentioned as required, as the execution context is of the user opening the file.
