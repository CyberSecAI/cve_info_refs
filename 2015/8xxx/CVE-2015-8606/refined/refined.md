Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the SilverStripe CMS & Framework. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode or validate data provided through certain form fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. This occurs because user-provided data, particularly within form fields' validation messages, is rendered in the browser without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will then be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have several severe impacts:
*   **User session cookie and end-user file disclosure:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Hijacking user sessions and account takeover:** Attackers could use stolen session cookies to impersonate users and take control of their accounts.
*   **Installation of Trojan horse programs:** Malicious scripts can be used to install malware on the user's machine.
*   **Redirection of the user to another site:** Victims could be redirected to phishing or other malicious websites.
*   **Modification of content presentation:** Attackers could manipulate the content displayed on the page, causing confusion or misinformation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into specific vulnerable form fields and their associated validation messages. The vulnerable parameters are:
*   `Locale`
*   `FailedLoginCount`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious JavaScript through crafted form input. This could be done by:
*   Crafting a malicious link that contains the payload.
*   Manipulating an existing form on the vulnerable website.
*  Social engineering techniques to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in SilverStripe CMS & Framework v3.2.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.2.1.
*   The vulnerable fields are related to form field classes, particularly NumericField and DropdownField.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when validation messages are displayed as a result of invalid input in those form fields.
*   The vulnerability is considered a high-risk issue by the vendor.
