{
  "CVE-2015-8958": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick: OOB read and possible crash when processing malformed SUN files",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient bounds checking when processing SUN image files. Specifically, when handling run-length encoded (RT_ENCODED) and non-run-length encoded SUN images, ImageMagick calculates the expected length of the pixel data based on image dimensions. However, when the provided `sun_info.length` is smaller than what is required to hold the full raster image the image processing can lead to an out-of-bounds read and possibly a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a crafted SUN file, leading to an out-of-bounds read, and potentially a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted SUN image file. This could occur if ImageMagick is used in an application that processes user-provided image files, or if a user opens a malicious image file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malformed SUN image file that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing by ImageMagick."
