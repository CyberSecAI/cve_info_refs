Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8485:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an access restriction bypass in Cybozu Office, which allows unauthorized access to certain information. Specifically, it is related to the exposure of titles of unpublished posts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Access Control Violation:** The core issue is a failure to properly enforce access restrictions, leading to the exposure of information that should have been protected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially view the titles of unpublished posts within the groupware.
- **Privilege Escalation (for Authenticated Attackers):** Authenticated attackers may gain privileged information or cause specific functions to be unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing to log in to the system.
- **Remote Authenticated Access:** An attacker who has logged into the system can exploit the vulnerability to potentially gain privileged information or disrupt specific functions.
- The attack vector is primarily network-based.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cybozu Office instance.
- **No Authentication Required (for Information Disclosure):** For the information disclosure vulnerability, no prior authentication is needed.
- **Authentication Required (for Privilege Escalation/Function Disruption):** For the more severe impact of privilege escalation and function disruption, the attacker needs valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Cybozu Office versions 9.9.0 to 10.3.0.
- The vendor, Cybozu, Inc., is aware of the issue and has released updates to fix it.
