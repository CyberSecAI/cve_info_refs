{
  "CVE-2015-8923": {
    "description": "The process_extra function in libarchive before 3.2.0 uses the size field and a signed number in an offset, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted zip file.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a signed number as an offset within the `process_extra` function, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read when processing malformed ZIP archive files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Integer overflow",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted ZIP archive, which would cause libarchive to crash, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allow a limited disclosure of application memory.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted ZIP archive file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed zip file and trick a user into processing it with a vulnerable version of libarchive."
