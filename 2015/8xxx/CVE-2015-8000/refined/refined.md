  "CVE-2015-8000": {
    "description": "named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.9.7-P2 and 9.10.x before 9.10.2-P3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit) via TKEY queries.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "9.x before 9.9.7-P2",
      "9.10.x before 9.10.2-P3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "An error in the parsing of incoming responses allows some records with an incorrect class to be accepted by BIND instead of being rejected as malformed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the way BIND processes records with malformed class attributes.",
      "Insufficient testing when parsing a message allowed records with an incorrect class to be be accepted, triggering a REQUIRE failure when those records were subsequently cached."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (REQUIRE assertion failure and daemon exit)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send a query to request a cached record with a malformed class attribute"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted DNS query.",
    "notes": [
      "This issue affects authoritative servers as well as recursive servers, however authoritative servers are at limited risk if they perform authentication when making recursive queries to resolve addresses for servers listed in NS RRSETs."
