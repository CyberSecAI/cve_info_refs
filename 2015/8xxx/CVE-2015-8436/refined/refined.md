Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to the identified CVEs:

**CVE-2015-8436**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the `PrintJob` object implementation of Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability arises when a dangling pointer is reused after it has been freed due to crafted `addPage` arguments.
*   **Impact:** Allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to lure the user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing specially crafted `addPage` arguments. This requires user interaction.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker needs to craft a malicious SWF file or webpage to trigger the vulnerability.

**CVE-2015-8437**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the `Selection` object implementation within Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted `setFocus` call.
*    **Impact:** Allows remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker needs to lure user to interact with malicious SWF content.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to craft a malicious SWF to trigger the vulnerability.

**CVE-2015-8433, CVE-2015-8434, CVE-2015-8435**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player.
*   **Weakness:** Triggered by unspecified vectors.
*   **Impact:** Allows remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requires user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to craft a malicious SWF to trigger the vulnerability.

**CVE-2015-8438**
*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow in Adobe Flash Player.
*  **Weakness:** Vulnerability occurs due to a mishandling of a crafted XML object during a `toString` call.
*   **Impact:** Allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker needs to get a user to interact with malicious SWF content.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to craft a malicious SWF to trigger the vulnerability.

**CVE-2015-8439**
*   **Root Cause:** Type confusion vulnerability in the `SharedObject` object implementation.
*   **Weakness:**  A type confusion is exploited via an unspecified way during a `getRemote` call.
*   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requires user interaction to exploit.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires crafting a malicious SWF file.

**Additional Notes:**
