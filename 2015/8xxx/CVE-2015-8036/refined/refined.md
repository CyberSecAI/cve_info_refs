Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the ARM mbed TLS library (formerly PolarSSL). This occurs during the processing of TLS session tickets when a client attempts to resume a previous session. Specifically, the `ssl_write_session_ticket_ext` function copies the session ticket data received from a server into the client's output buffer without proper bounds checking. If the server sends a session ticket larger than the available space in the output buffer, it will lead to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Bounds Checking:** The `ssl_write_session_ticket_ext` function fails to verify that the size of the session ticket data will fit within the remaining space of the output buffer before copying it using `memcpy`.
*   **Unbounded Copy:** The `memcpy` operation copies an arbitrary amount of data, determined by the server-supplied ticket length, into the fixed-size output buffer.
*   **Reliance on Server-Supplied Length:** The client trusts the server-provided session ticket length without verifying it against the available buffer space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious server can send an overly long session ticket to the client. This overflow causes the client to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The heap overflow has the potential to overwrite heap metadata or other data structures, which could be leveraged by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the client machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TLS Server:** The attack vector is a malicious TLS server that sends a crafted, oversized session ticket to a vulnerable client during session resumption.
*   **Client-Initiated Connection:** The client must initiate a TLS connection to the malicious server to be vulnerable.
*   **Session Resumption:** The vulnerability is triggered when the client attempts to resume a previous session using a session ticket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Not Required:** The attacker does not need to intercept or modify existing traffic between the client and the legitimate server. They need to operate a malicious server.
*   **TLS Server Control:** The attacker must control the TLS server that the vulnerable client connects to.
*   **Session Ticket Manipulation:** The attacker must have the ability to send an arbitrary sized session ticket to the client.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the oversized session ticket.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the client-side implementation of the mbed TLS library.
*   The vulnerability was originally part of a larger CVE (CVE-2015-5291), but was split due to different affected version ranges.
*   The default size of the output buffer is 16KB, while the size of the session ticket can go up to 64KB, making the overflow possible.
*   Other TLS extensions using similar mechanisms in the library, such as hostname and ALPN, are also vulnerable if a large amount of data can be supplied.
*   The size of the hostname can also be manipulated, for example through DNS spoofing, to trigger heap corruption via `ssl_write_hostname_ext`.
