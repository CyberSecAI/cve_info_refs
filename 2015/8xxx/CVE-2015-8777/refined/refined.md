{
  "CVE-2015-8777": {
    "description": "The `LD_POINTER_GUARD` environment variable is not sanitized in glibc before 2.23, allowing local users to bypass pointer guarding protection on set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.",
    "root_cause": "The dynamic loader does not sanitize the `LD_POINTER_GUARD` environment variable for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs, thus it can be modified by local users.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Pointer Guard Bypass",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can disable the pointer guard security mechanism, which makes the system weaker and allows for easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.",
    "attack_vector": "Local attacker uses the `LD_POINTER_GUARD` environment variable to disable pointer protection for a vulnerable setuid/setgid program.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user needs to be able to set the `LD_POINTER_GUARD` environment variable and execute a vulnerable setuid/setgid program.",
        "additional_details": "Pointer guarding is a security mechanism to protect against pointer hijacking by mangling pointers to code stored in writable program memory (like return addresses). The vulnerability is specific to dynamically linked applications. Static binaries are not affected."
