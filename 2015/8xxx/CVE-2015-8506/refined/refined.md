{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities in mediaserver, Skia component, display drivers, Bluetooth component, libstagefright, SystemUI, Native Frameworks Library, Wi-Fi, System Server, Audio component, and Media Framework due to memory corruption and insufficient input validation while processing media files and data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption in mediaserver during media file and data processing.",
    "Memory corruption in Skia component during media file processing.",
    "Memory corruption in display drivers during media file processing.",
     "Remote code execution vulnerability in Bluetooth component.",
    "Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in libstagefright.",
    "Elevation of privilege vulnerability in SystemUI.",
    "Information disclosure vulnerability in Native Frameworks Library.",
    "Elevation of privilege vulnerability in Wi-Fi.",
    "Elevation of privilege vulnerability in System Server.",
     "Information disclosure vulnerabilities in libstagefright.",
    "Information disclosure vulnerability in Audio component.",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability in Media Framework.",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability in Wi-Fi.",
        "Elevation of privilege vulnerability in System Server.",
          "Information disclosure vulnerability in SystemUI."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with the privileges of mediaserver, system service or user mode drivers, local privilege escalation to root, information disclosure, bypass of security measures, ability to gain elevated capabilities such as signature or signatureOrSystem permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation can occur through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. Local malicious applications can also trigger some of these vulnerabilities.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For remote code execution vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to send specially crafted media files via email, web browsing, or MMS. For local privilege escalation, the attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. Some vulnerabilities also require a successfully paired Bluetooth device in proximity or a user to interact with system applications like the clock app."
