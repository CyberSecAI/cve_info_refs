Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8326:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `IPTables::Parse` Perl module used predictable names for temporary files it created. Specifically, it was using `/tmp/ipt.out$$` and `/tmp/ipt.err$$` where `$$` is the current process ID, which can be predicted and manipulated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The module used predictable file names for temporary files.
- **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** The predictable names made it possible for an attacker to create a symlink with the same name before the module creates the actual temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could create symlinks with the same names as the temporary files used by `IPTables::Parse`. When the module attempts to write to these temporary files, it would instead write to the files pointed to by the symlinks, potentially leading to:
   - **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The attacker could overwrite any file on the system that the user running the module had write access to.
   - **Privilege Escalation (potentially):** If the user running the module had higher privileges, then an attacker might overwrite system files and gain further access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to a multi-user system where the vulnerable `IPTables::Parse` module is used. The attacker must be able to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory, or in any of the temporary directories the user has write access to.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on a multi-user system where the `IPTables::Parse` module is being used.
- The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks in the same directory where the module is creating temporary files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by using the `mktemp()` function to create temporary files with unpredictable names, instead of constructing the filenames with the process ID.
- The issue affects not only `IPTables::Parse` directly, but also other modules that use it, such as `fwsnort` and `perl-IPTables-ChainMgr` (which is used by `psad`).
- The fix also included a recommendation to users who manually override the temporary file locations using 'iptout' and 'ipterr' hash keys to avoid using predictable names.
- The vulnerable code was present in versions prior to 1.6.
