{
  "cve": "CVE-2015-8222",
  "description": "LXD uses systemd socket activation to start the daemon. Systemd defaults to 0666 for its unix sockets instead of respecting umask, leading to /var/lib/lxd/unix.socket being world writable instead of being restricted to the lxd group as it should be.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Systemd's default behavior for unix socket permissions, not respecting the umask.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect default permissions on a unix socket.",
      "World-writable socket allows unauthorized access."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation. An attacker could use the world-writable socket to gain unauthorized access to LXD daemon and execute commands with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with access to the system on which LXD is running."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "fix": "The fix was to specify a mode of 0660 in the systemd unit file.",
    "affected_versions": "LXD in wily, xenial, and trusty-backports. Vivid's version was unaffected.",
    "ubuntu_security_notice": "USN-2809-1: LXD vulnerability. LXD could be made to run programs as an administrator due to incorrect socket permissions."
