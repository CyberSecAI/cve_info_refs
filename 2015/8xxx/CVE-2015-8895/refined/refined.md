     "Affected_Components": "coders/icon.c",
     "Affected_Versions": "Versions 6.8.9.9 and 6.9.1-3 of ImageMagick",
   "Description": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when allocating memory for a PNG image within an ICO file. Specifically, the size of the PNG image is read from the file and stored as a 4-byte integer. A fixed value (16 bytes in some versions, 12 in others) is added to this size to allocate memory. If the read size is close to the maximum integer value, adding 16 will cause an integer overflow, and a small memory region will be allocated. However, the code continues as if the full size had been allocated and performs operations that read and write beyond allocated bounds, leading to a crash or other unpredictable behaviours"
