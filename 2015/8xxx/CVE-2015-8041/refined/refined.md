Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-8041:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2015-8041, confirming it's related to the vulnerability. Specifically, the text from w1.fi explicitly states that "Identifier: CVE-2015-8041" is associated with the described vulnerability of an incomplete validation of WPS and P2P NFC NDEF record payload lengths.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the NDEF record parsing implementation of `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`. Specifically, the 32-bit `total_length` value was not validated properly allowing an overflow that bypassed the boundary checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A 32-bit integer representing the total record length is not properly checked, leading to potential wraparound if the payload length is very large.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** The NDEF record payload length was not validated against the actual buffer size.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   Process termination due to a buffer read overflow.
    *   Infinite loop within the `ndef_parse_records()` function.
    *   Memory exhaustion through attempts to allocate a huge amount of memory (close to 2^32 bytes).
*   **Memory Corruption:** Buffer read overflow (up to about 20 bytes) can occur outside the intended buffer limits causing crashes or possibly other undefined behavior.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious NFC Tag:** Using a specially crafted NFC tag with a malformed NDEF record.
*   **NFC Connection Handover:** Injecting the malformed NDEF record during an NFC connection handover process.
*   **Local Exploitation:** If the hostapd/wpa\_supplicant control interface is exposed to untrusted local components or users, this could be exploited by sending crafted messages directly to the process.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within NFC range or must have local access to the control interface.
*   **Technical Skill:** The attacker needs to create malformed NDEF records that trigger the integer overflow.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the NDEF record using the function `ndef_parse_record`.
*   The issue occurs due to an integer overflow of the `record->total_length` value during calculation.
*   The vulnerability affects both `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant` applications.
*   The issue is dependent on the device's NFC stack not validating NDEF records prior to passing them to `hostapd/wpa_supplicant`, but the software is intended to be able to handle potentially malformed data.
*   The vulnerability was discovered with the help of Coverity Scan.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the patch provided by the vendor or upgrade to version 2.5 or newer.
*   Disable WPS NFC functionality.
*   Ensure the device's NFC stack is performing proper validation of received NDEF messages.

In summary, CVE-2015-8041 details a vulnerability caused by insufficient checks during the parsing of NFC NDEF records in `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`, potentially leading to denial of service and/or memory corruption. The vulnerability arises due to an integer overflow vulnerability.
