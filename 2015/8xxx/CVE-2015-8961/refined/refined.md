  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2015-8961",
    "description": "There is a use-after-free possibility in __ext4_journal_stop() in the case that we free the handle in the first jbd2_journal_stop() because we're referencing handle->h_err afterwards.",
    "affected_component": "ext4 filesystem",
    "root_cause": "The code attempts to access `handle->h_err` after the `handle` may have been freed by `jbd2_journal_stop()` when `handle->h_transaction` is NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
     ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free condition can lead to memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger specific conditions in the ext4 filesystem that leads to handle being freed, while still needing to access information from the handle."
