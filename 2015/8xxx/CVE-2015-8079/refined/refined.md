Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8079

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- QtWebKit was logging visited URLs to the `WebpageIcons.db` database even when in private browsing mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privacy violation: User's browsing history, which should have remained private during private browsing, was being recorded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of browsing history even in private mode. An attacker with access to the `WebpageIcons.db` file could potentially see the list of visited URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the `WebpageIcons.db` file. This could be achieved via malware on a user's machine or a compromised user account with access to that data.
- Direct access to the user's machine with the database file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker would need to have access to the filesystem where the `WebpageIcons.db` file is stored. This could be achieved through local file system access, malware, or compromised user accounts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was addressed by a patch in QtWebKit that prevents logging of visited URLs during private browsing.
- Patches were pushed to Fedora and EPEL repositories to fix this issue.
