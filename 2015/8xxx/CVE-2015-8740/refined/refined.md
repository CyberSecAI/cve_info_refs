Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `dissect_tds7_colmetadata_token` function within the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The function attempts to write more data to a stack buffer than it can hold, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By injecting a malformed TDS packet, an attacker can cause Wireshark to crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although this is not detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malformed network packets: Attacker can inject a specially crafted TDS packet onto the network.
- Malformed capture files: An attacker can provide a malformed packet trace file to a user of wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to a system running Wireshark or the ability to convince a user to open a malicious capture file.
- Ability to craft or modify TDS packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
- A reproducer capture file (`asan_stack-oob_3b5b130_7003_1a184f717196b3f413eebf5feac1cb08.cap`) is available.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark version 2.0.0
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 2.0.1
- Gentoo also released a security advisory (GLSA 201604-05) to address this and other wireshark vulnerabilities.

The provided information gives more details than the CVE description which simply states: "The dissect_tds7_colmetadata_token function in epan/dissectors/packet-tds.c in the TDS dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 has a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet."
