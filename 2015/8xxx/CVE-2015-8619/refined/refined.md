Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8619:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `hmp_sendkey` routine of QEMU's Human Monitor Interface (HMP). Specifically, when processing the `sendkey` command, the routine attempts to null-terminate the `keyname_buf` array after copying the user-provided keyname. If the provided keyname is longer than the buffer's size, this null termination writes beyond the buffer's boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is the out-of-bounds write due to the redundant null termination, which occurs when the `keyname_len` exceeds the allocated size of the `keyname_buf` array. The `pstrcpy` function already null-terminates the buffer so the explicit null termination is redundant and causes the out-of-bounds write.
- **Lack of proper input validation:** The code doesn't properly validate the length of the keyname before writing it to `keyname_buf` and before the redundant null termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the QEMU process due to the out-of-bounds write, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the immediate impact is DoS, the out-of-bounds write could potentially be exploited for more severe consequences, though the provided information doesn't explicitly detail these.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HMP `sendkey` command:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `sendkey` command to the QEMU monitor interface with a keyname argument longer than 16 bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to QEMU monitor:** The attacker needs to have access to the QEMU monitor interface (HMP) to send the malicious `sendkey` command. This could be a local user within a guest VM if the HMP is exposed, or a user with access to the QEMU host system's monitor interface.
- **Knowledge of HMP:** The attacker needs to know how to send commands to the QEMU HMP.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
- A patch was created to remove the redundant null termination from `hmp_sendkey` routine since the pstrcpy routine already null terminates.
- The vulnerability is addressed in QEMU version 2.5.0-r2 and later.
