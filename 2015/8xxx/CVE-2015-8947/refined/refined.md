  "CVE-2015-8947": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in `hb-ot-layout-gpos-table.hh` in HarfBuzz.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer over-read due to incorrect handling of memory and length checks.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impacts (e.g. arbitrary code execution).",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted data processed by HarfBuzz.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted data to HarfBuzz through a network vector."

      {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory access issue in `hb-ot-layout-gpos-table.hh` exists due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read, leading to a denial of service.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or have other unspecified impacts via crafted data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted data processed by HarfBuzz through a network vector.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted data to HarfBuzz. This vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing, indicating no explicit preconditions."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "An inverted length check exists in `hb-ot-font.cc`",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer over-read in `hb-ot-font.cc`.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service or possibly have other impact via crafted data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted data processed by HarfBuzz via network vectors.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to cause HarfBuzz to process a specific type of crafted data. No explicit user interaction or preconditions appear to be necessary, and it was found via fuzzing."
