{
  "CVE-2015-8213": {
    "Description": "An information-exposure flaw was found in the Django date filter. If an application allowed users to provide non-validated date formats, a malicious end user could expose application-settings data by providing the relevant applications-settings key instead of a valid date format.",
    "Root cause": "The Django date template filter's underlying `get_format()` function was not properly validating user-supplied input, allowing access to application settings via specially crafted format strings.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Input Validation",
      "Information Exposure"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user could potentially expose sensitive application settings, such as the SECRET_KEY, by providing a specific settings key as a date format string.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through web applications that accept user-provided date formats and use them with Django's `date` template filter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a custom date format string to an application using the vulnerable django `date` filter."
