Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant-time string comparison in the `User::matchEditToken` function within MediaWiki. Specifically, a standard equality check (`!=`) was performed before a constant-time comparison using `hash_equals`. This negated the security benefits of using `hash_equals` because the execution time of the equality check could leak information about the token being compared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Side-Channel:** The primary vulnerability is a timing side-channel. The initial string comparison (`!=`) would take a variable amount of time depending on how many characters matched, which could potentially be exploited by an attacker to guess the value of the edit token.
*   **Non-Constant Time Comparison:** The use of `!=` for the initial check introduces a non-constant time comparison that can expose token information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** By measuring the time taken for the `User::matchEditToken` function to execute, an attacker could potentially deduce information about the edit token, potentially leading to bypassing of CSRF protection. Although the report indicates this was considered difficult to exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Timing Analysis:** The attack vector involves timing the server's response to requests involving edit token validation.  An attacker would attempt to correlate the response time with different token guesses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to a MediaWiki instance and to measure the timing of the responses.
*   **Knowledge of CSRF token validation process:** An attacker would need to understand that the vulnerability was present in the token validation process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was considered a security issue and was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.23.12, 1.24.5, 1.25.4, 1.26.1, and later.
*   The fix involved replacing the initial non-constant-time string comparison with `hash_equals` to ensure that the time taken for token comparison was independent of the values being compared.

The provided information also indicates that this CVE is related to the debugging statement in the function, specifically the `wfDebug` call which is dependent on the result of the initial non-constant time check.  This is in contrast to CVE-2015-8623 which relates to the main logic of the `User::matchEditToken` function.
