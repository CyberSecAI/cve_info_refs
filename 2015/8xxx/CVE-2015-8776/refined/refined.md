Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input validation within the `strftime` function in glibc. Specifically, when out-of-range time values are passed to `strftime`, it can attempt to access memory locations outside the valid bounds of its internal data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Out-of-bounds memory access due to improper handling of out-of-range time values by the `strftime` function.
- Lack of input validation in `strftime` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of service (application crash): Exploiting the vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault due to invalid memory access, causing the application to crash.
- Potential information disclosure: The out-of-bounds memory access could potentially leak information from the memory regions being accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by passing crafted, out-of-range time values to the `strftime` function. 
- Although the specific vector isn't detailed, an attacker could control a time value in a way that causes `strftime` to crash via an out of bound memory access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to pass arbitrary time values to an application using the vulnerable `strftime` function.
- This could be a local or remote attacker, depending on the application's use of `strftime` and how it processes time information.
- A malicious user or program has to control values of the 'tm' struct passed to strftime.

**Additional Notes:**

- Some sources mention that applications normally pass only valid time information to `strftime`.
-  One mitigation strategy suggests checking time values before they are passed to strftime, or calling `strftime` only with `struct tm` values computed by `gmtime` or `localtime`.
- The vulnerability is resolved by adding a range check on the time fields in `strftime`.
- Upstream fix was made available with commit d36c75fc0d44deec29635dd239b0fbd206ca49b7
- The fix is included in glibc 2.23
