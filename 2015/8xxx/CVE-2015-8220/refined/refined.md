- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs while parsing command-line arguments in DWRCC.exe. This is triggered by crafting a malicious link with overly long parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious link, or potentially a malicious file, that when opened by the user triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince the target user to open a malicious link or file. The attacker is remote, and no authentication is required.
