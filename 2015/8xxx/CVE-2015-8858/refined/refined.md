The content is related to CVE-2015-8858.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) in the `uglify-js` package before version 2.6.0 for Node.js.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A vulnerable regular expression is present within the `uglify-js` package, leading to potential denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing crafted input that causes the vulnerable regular expression to consume excessive resources (CPU and time), blocking the event loop.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by providing maliciously crafted input to the `uglify-js` package. This could occur if the package is used to process untrusted input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to provide input to the `uglify-js` package that would trigger the vulnerable regex.
