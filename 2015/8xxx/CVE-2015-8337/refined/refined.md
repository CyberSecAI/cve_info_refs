Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8337
*   **Description:** A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the HIFI driver of certain Huawei smartphones. This vulnerability is identified by Huawei as HWPSIRT-2015-11008.

**Root Cause:**

*   The HIFI driver does not properly validate parameters received from applications. Specifically, it's vulnerable when a null pointer is passed as a parameter to a function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The HIFI driver lacks proper validation of input parameters, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:**  The driver attempts to dereference a null pointer when it receives one as a parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in the device rebooting, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on the smartphone.
*   **System Calls:**  The malicious application then uses system calls to interact with the vulnerable HIFI driver interface.
*   **Null Pointer Input:** The application sends a null pointer as a parameter to the HIFI driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Distribute Malicious App:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious app to a user.
*   **Access to System Calls:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious app that can interact with the specific HIFI driver interface using system calls.
* **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to install the malicious application.

**Additional Details from the Advisory:**

*   The advisory provides a list of affected devices and the corresponding software versions. It also lists the patched versions to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Guo Yonggang and Zhao Jianqiang from Lab 0x031E of Qihoo 360 Technology Co.Ltd.
*   Huawei provides various methods for obtaining the fix, including automatic updates, updates through their consumer website, and by contacting their Technical Assistance Center (TAC).
* The CVSSv2 base score is 4.0 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) which indicates that the vulnerability has low impact, it is locally exploitable but the attack complexity is high, and the vulnerability results in a complete loss of availability.
