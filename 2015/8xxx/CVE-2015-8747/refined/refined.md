Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of component names when using the `multifilesystem` storage backend in Radicale. User-controlled component names were directly used to construct file paths, without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. By crafting malicious component names (e.g., using `/` or `..`), an attacker could access or manipulate files outside of the intended storage directory.

*   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files on the server, subject to the permissions of the user running the Radicale server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could read sensitive files or configurations.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:** Attackers could modify or delete existing files, potentially leading to data loss or service disruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, the potential for privilege escalation exists if an attacker could overwrite files used by the system with malicious files (if the server is run with elevated privileges)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Requests:** Attackers could send specially crafted requests with malicious component names to the Radicale server.
*   **Multifilesystem Backend:** The vulnerability is specific to the `multifilesystem` storage backend, which is not enabled by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Radicale server.
*   **Radicale Instance:** The attacker requires knowledge of a Radicale instance using the vulnerable multifilesystem backend.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, specifying the malicious file paths.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented involves using a `is_safe_filesystem_path_component` function to sanitize the component names, preventing path traversal.
*   The `multifilesystem` backend was marked as "not ready for production" before this vulnerability was fixed, but the vulnerability existed nevertheless.
*   The vulnerability existed on all platforms where Radicale could be used
