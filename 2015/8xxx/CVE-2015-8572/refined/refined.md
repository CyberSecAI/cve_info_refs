The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-8572, all affecting Autodesk Design Review. It appears that the CVE ID was used to track multiple distinct vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in handling GIF files. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle cases where a GlobalColorTable is present but not explicitly specified, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of GIF file format, specifically the GlobalColorTable.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The user must open a malicious GIF file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in handling PCX files. The application fails to validate scan line decoding within the allocated buffer, leading to out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weakness:** Improper bounds checking during PCX file processing.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The user must open a malicious PCX file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PCX file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in handling BMP files. The application fails to ensure that run-length encoded data does not write outside the allocated buffer.
*  **Weakness:** Improper handling of run-length encoded data in BMP files.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The user must open a malicious BMP file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious BMP file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in handling FLI files. The application fails to ensure that run-length encoded data does not write outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of run-length encoded data in FLI files.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The user must open a malicious FLI file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious FLI file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 5:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in handling GIF files, specifically with DataSubBlocks. The application fails to ensure that the DataSubBlock sizes are valid.
*   **Weakness:** Improper size validation during GIF DataSubBlock processing.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The user must open a malicious GIF file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.
