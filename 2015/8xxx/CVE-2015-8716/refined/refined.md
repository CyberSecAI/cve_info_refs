Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the T.38 dissector of Wireshark. The specific cause is not detailed, but the dissector was found to be vulnerable to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The T.38 dissector in Wireshark is vulnerable to a crash.
- Malformed packets trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing Wireshark to crash.
- This can occur by processing a malformed packet captured from the network or by opening a malformed capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed T.38 packet onto the network, which will trigger the crash when captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can provide a malformed packet trace file that contains a malicious T.38 packet. If a user opens the file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark, the application will crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either inject network traffic or provide a malicious packet capture file.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, but the user needs to be running a vulnerable version of Wireshark to be impacted.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was originally tracked as Wireshark bug 9887.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.8.
- The fix is available in version 1.12.9 and later.
