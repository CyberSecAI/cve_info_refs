Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8524

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input escaping within the IBM Business Process Manager Process Portal. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. User-supplied input is not properly escaped, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This script executes within the security context of the hosting website.
*   **Stealing Credentials:** Attackers can steal a user's cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access.
*   **Data theft/modification:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal data or modify data within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted URLs:**  Attackers create a malicious URL containing injected scripts.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must click on the malicious URL for the exploit to be triggered. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability, so the malicious script is embedded in the request the user sends.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker can be remote, and does not require direct access to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the malicious link, which could be achieved through phishing.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM Business Process Manager V8.5.0.0 through V8.5.6.0 (including Express, Standard, and Advanced editions).

**Remediation:**
*   Apply the interim fix for APAR JR54981 which provides proper escaping and sanitization of user inputs.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   CVSS Base Score: 6.1
*   CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
    *   AV:N (Network)
    *   AC:L (Low)
    *   PR:N (None)
    *   UI:R (Required User Interaction)
    *   S:C (Changed Scope)
    *   C:L (Low Confidentiality Impact)
    *   I:L (Low Integrity Impact)
    *   A:N (No Availability Impact)
