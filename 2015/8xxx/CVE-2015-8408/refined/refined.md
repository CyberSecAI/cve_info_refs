Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-8408:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2015-8408 is a memory corruption vulnerability within Adobe Flash Player. Specifically, it is triggered by unspecified vectors that lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is memory corruption. This implies that the software is writing data to a memory location it shouldn't be, potentially overwriting critical data structures or code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This means an attacker can gain control over the victim's machine.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the affected software or system unavailable. This could result from a crash caused by the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unspecified Vectors:** The exact attack vectors for this vulnerability are not specified. This means the vulnerability can be triggered through multiple avenues or methods, which are not detailed in this disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the victim's system over the network, usually through a web browser. This means that the attacker can be anywhere on the network or the internet.
*   **Ability to trigger Flash content:** The attacker must be able to make the victim's flash player process the malicious content. This could be done through various methods such as a malicious web site or ad.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without having to authenticate with the system or the Flash player application. This increases the severity of the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities fixed by an Adobe security update as indicated by the multiple CVEs listed in the advisories.
*   The severity of this issue is rated as "important" and has a CVSS v2 base score of 10, the highest possible. This reflects the critical impact of successful exploitation.
