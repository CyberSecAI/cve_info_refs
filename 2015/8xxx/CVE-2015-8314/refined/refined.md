  "CVE-2015-8314": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "cve_description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "description": "Devise version before 3.5.4 uses cookies to implement a \"Remember me\" functionality. However, it generates the same cookie for all devices. If an attacker manages to steal a remember me cookie and the user does not change the password frequently, the cookie can be used to gain access to the application indefinitely.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the 'Remember me' functionality in Devise versions before 3.5.4 generates the same cookie for all devices. This means the cookie does not uniquely identify the device or session, allowing for reuse.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure cookie generation: The application generates the same 'remember me' cookie across all devices. This cookie should be unique to each device/session.",
      "Lack of cookie expiration mechanism: If the 'remember me' cookie is not invalidated and the user does not change the password frequently, it could be used to gain access indefinitely."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who steals a 'remember me' cookie can use it to gain unauthorized access to the application. If the user does not change the password frequently, the attacker's access can be indefinite.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Cookie theft: An attacker gains access to a user's 'remember me' cookie through various methods (e.g., network sniffing, cross-site scripting, malware).",
      "Cookie replay: The attacker uses the stolen cookie to authenticate as the legitimate user on any device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to steal a user's 'remember me' cookie. This could be done through various attack vectors, such as network sniffing, cross-site scripting (XSS), or malware. Once the cookie is obtained, the attacker can replay it to gain access.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability is in the devise gem, a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden.",
      "The vulnerability was fixed by storing the creation timestamp in the remember cookies, making the cookie expire even if the user doesn't sign out.",
      "The vulnerability was fixed in devise version 3.5.4.",
      "The vulnerability affects the rememberable module in Devise."
