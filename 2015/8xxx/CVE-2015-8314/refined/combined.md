### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden. It:

* Is Rack based;
* Is a complete MVC solution based on Rails engines;
* Allows you to have multiple models signed in at the same time;
* Is based on a modularity concept: use only what you really need.

It's composed of 10 modules:

* [Database Authenticatable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/DatabaseAuthenticatable): hashes and stores a password in the database to validate the authenticity of a user while signing in. The authentication can be done both through POST requests or HTTP Basic Authentication.
* [Omniauthable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Omniauthable): adds OmniAuth (<https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth>) support.
* [Confirmable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Confirmable): sends emails with confirmation instructions and verifies whether an account is already confirmed during sign in.
* [Recoverable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Recoverable): resets the user password and sends reset instructions.
* [Registerable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Registerable): handles signing up users through a registration process, also allowing them to edit and destroy their account.
* [Rememberable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Rememberable): manages generating and clearing a token for remembering the user from a saved cookie.
* [Trackable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Trackable): tracks sign in count, timestamps and IP address.
* [Timeoutable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Timeoutable): expires sessions that have not been active in a specified period of time.
* [Validatable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Validatable): provides validations of email and password. It's optional and can be customized, so you're able to define your own validations.
* [Lockable](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Lockable): locks an account after a specified number of failed sign-in attempts. Can unlock via email or after a specified time period.

## Information

### The Devise wiki

The Devise Wiki has lots of additional information about Devise including many "how-to" articles and answers to the most frequently asked questions. Please browse the Wiki after finishing this README:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki>

### Bug reports

If you discover a problem with Devise, we would like to know about it. However, we ask that you please review these guidelines before submitting a bug report:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Bug-reports>

If you have discovered a security related bug, please do *NOT* use the GitHub issue tracker. Send an email to heartcombo@googlegroups.com.

### StackOverflow and Mailing List

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please use StackOverflow instead of the GitHub issue tracker:

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/devise>

The deprecated mailing list can still be read on

<https://groups.google.com/group/plataformatec-devise>

### RDocs

You can view the Devise documentation in RDoc format here:

<http://rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/frames>

If you need to use Devise with previous versions of Rails, you can always run "gem server" from the command line after you install the gem to access the old documentation.

### Example applications

There are a few example applications available on GitHub that demonstrate various features of Devise with different versions of Rails. You can view them here:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Example-Applications>

### Extensions

Our community has created a number of extensions that add functionality above and beyond what is included with Devise. You can view a list of available extensions and add your own here:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Extensions>

### Contributing

We hope that you will consider contributing to Devise. Please read this short overview for some information about how to get started:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/Contributing>

You will usually want to write tests for your changes. To run the test suite, go into Devise's top-level directory and run `bundle install` and `bin/test`.
Devise works with multiple Ruby and Rails versions, and ActiveRecord and Mongoid ORMs, which means you can run the test suite with some modifiers: `DEVISE_ORM` and `BUNDLE_GEMFILE`.

### DEVISE\_ORM

Since Devise supports both Mongoid and ActiveRecord, we rely on this variable to run specific code for each ORM.
The default value of `DEVISE_ORM` is `active_record`. To run the tests for Mongoid, you can pass `mongoid`:

```
DEVISE_ORM=mongoid bin/test

==> Devise.orm = :mongoid

```

When running the tests for Mongoid, you will need to have a MongoDB server (version 2.0 or newer) running on your system.

Please note that the command output will show the variable value being used.

### BUNDLE\_GEMFILE

We can use this variable to tell bundler what Gemfile it should use (instead of the one in the current directory).
Inside the [gemfiles](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/tree/main/gemfiles) directory, we have one for each version of Rails we support. When you send us a pull request, it may happen that the test suite breaks using some of them. If that's the case, you can simulate the same environment using the `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` variable.
For example, if the tests broke using Ruby 3.0.0 and Rails 6.0, you can do the following:

```
rbenv shell 3.0.0 # or rvm use 3.0.0
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile-rails-6-0 bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile-rails-6-0 bin/test
```

You can also combine both of them if the tests broke for Mongoid:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile-rails-6-0 bundle install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile-rails-6-0 DEVISE_ORM=mongoid bin/test
```

### Running tests

Devise uses [Mini Test](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) as test framework.

* Running all tests:

```
bin/test
```

* Running tests for an specific file:

```
bin/test test/models/trackable_test.rb
```

* Running a specific test given a regex:

```
bin/test test/models/trackable_test.rb:16

If you are building your first Rails application, we recommend you *do not* use Devise. Devise requires a good understanding of the Rails Framework. In such cases, we advise you to start a simple authentication system from scratch. Here's a few resources that should help you get started:

* Michael Hartl's online book: <https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users>
* Ryan Bates' Railscasts: <http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch> and <http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised>
* Codecademy's Ruby on Rails: Authentication and Authorization: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/rails-auth>

Once you have solidified your understanding of Rails and authentication mechanisms, we assure you Devise will be very pleasant to work with. 😃

## Getting started

Devise 4.0 works with Rails 6.0 onwards. Run:

```
bundle add devise
```

Next, you need to run the generator:

```
rails generate devise:install
```

At this point, a number of instructions will appear in the console. Among these instructions, you'll need to set up the default URL options for the Devise mailer in each environment. Here is a possible configuration for `config/environments/development.rb`:

```
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

The generator will install an initializer which describes ALL of Devise's configuration options. It is *imperative* that you take a look at it. When you are done, you are ready to add Devise to any of your models using the generator.

In the following command you will replace `MODEL` with the class name used for the application’s users (it’s frequently `User` but could also be `Admin`). This will create a model (if one does not exist) and configure it with the default Devise modules. The generator also configures your `config/routes.rb` file to point to the Devise controller.

```
rails generate devise MODEL
```

Next, check the MODEL for any additional configuration options you might want to add, such as confirmable or lockable. If you add an option, be sure to inspect the migration file (created by the generator if your ORM supports them) and uncomment the appropriate section. For example, if you add the confirmable option in the model, you'll need to uncomment the Confirmable section in the migration.

Then run `rails db:migrate`

You should restart your application after changing Devise's configuration options (this includes stopping spring). Otherwise, you will run into strange errors, for example, users being unable to login and route helpers being undefined.

### Controller filters and helpers

Devise will create some helpers to use inside your controllers and views. To set up a controller with user authentication, just add this before\_action (assuming your devise model is 'User'):

```
before_action :authenticate_user!
```

For Rails 5, note that `protect_from_forgery` is no longer prepended to the `before_action` chain, so if you have set `authenticate_user` before `protect_from_forgery`, your request will result in "Can't verify CSRF token authenticity." To resolve this, either change the order in which you call them, or use `protect_from_forgery prepend: true`.

If your devise model is something other than User, replace "\_user" with "\_yourmodel". The same logic applies to the instructions below.

To verify if a user is signed in, use the following helper:

```
user_signed_in?
```

For the current signed-in user, this helper is available:

```
current_user
```

You can access the session for this scope:

```
user_session
```

After signing in a user, confirming the account or updating the password, Devise will look for a scoped root path to redirect to. For instance, when using a `:user` resource, the `user_root_path` will be used if it exists; otherwise, the default `root_path` will be used. This means that you need to set the root inside your routes:

```
root to: 'home#index'
```

You can also override `after_sign_in_path_for` and `after_sign_out_path_for` to customize your redirect hooks.

Notice that if your Devise model is called `Member` instead of `User`, for example, then the helpers available are:

```
before_action :authenticate_member!

member_signed_in?

current_member

member_session
```

### Configuring Models

The Devise method in your models also accepts some options to configure its modules. For example, you can choose the cost of the hashing algorithm with:

```
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :confirmable, :recoverable, stretches: 13
```

Besides `:stretches`, you can define `:pepper`, `:encryptor`, `:confirm_within`, `:remember_for`, `:timeout_in`, `:unlock_in` among other options. For more details, see the initializer file that was created when you invoked the "devise:install" generator described above. This file is usually located at `/config/initializers/devise.rb`.

### Strong Parameters

The Parameter Sanitizer API has changed for Devise 4 ⚠️

*For previous Devise versions see <https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/tree/3-stable#strong-parameters>*

When you customize your own views, you may end up adding new attributes to forms. Rails 4 moved the parameter sanitization from the model to the controller, causing Devise to handle this concern at the controller as well.

There are just three actions in Devise that allow any set of parameters to be passed down to the model, therefore requiring sanitization. Their names and default permitted parameters are:

* `sign_in` (`Devise::SessionsController#create`) - Permits only the authentication keys (like `email`)
* `sign_up` (`Devise::RegistrationsController#create`) - Permits authentication keys plus `password` and `password_confirmation`
* `account_update` (`Devise::RegistrationsController#update`) - Permits authentication keys plus `password`, `password_confirmation` and `current_password`

In case you want to permit additional parameters (the lazy way™), you can do so using a simple before action in your `ApplicationController`:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

  protected

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:username])
  end
end
```

The above works for any additional fields where the parameters are simple scalar types. If you have nested attributes (say you're using `accepts_nested_attributes_for`), then you will need to tell devise about those nestings and types:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

  protected

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:first_name, :last_name, address_attributes: [:country, :state, :city, :area, :postal_code]])
  end
end
```

Devise allows you to completely change Devise defaults or invoke custom behavior by passing a block:

To permit simple scalar values for username and email, use this

```
def configure_permitted_parameters
  devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_in) do |user_params|
    user_params.permit(:username, :email)
  end
end
```

If you have some checkboxes that express the roles a user may take on registration, the browser will send those selected checkboxes as an array. An array is not one of Strong Parameters' permitted scalars, so we need to configure Devise in the following way:

```
def configure_permitted_parameters
  devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up) do |user_params|
    user_params.permit({ roles: [] }, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  end
end
```

For the list of permitted scalars, and how to declare permitted keys in nested hashes and arrays, see

<https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters#nested-parameters>

If you have multiple Devise models, you may want to set up a different parameter sanitizer per model. In this case, we recommend inheriting from `Devise::ParameterSanitizer` and adding your own logic:

```
class User::ParameterSanitizer < Devise::ParameterSanitizer
  def initialize(*)
    super
    permit(:sign_up, keys: [:username, :email])
  end
end
```

And then configure your controllers to use it:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protected

  def devise_parameter_sanitizer
    if resource_class == User
      User::ParameterSanitizer.new(User, :user, params)
    else
      super # Use the default one
    end
  end
end
```

The example above overrides the permitted parameters for the user to be both `:username` and `:email`. The non-lazy way to configure parameters would be by defining the before filter above in a custom controller. We detail how to configure and customize controllers in some sections below.

### Configuring views

We built Devise to help you quickly develop an application that uses authentication. However, we don't want to be in your way when you need to customize it.

Since Devise is an engine, all its views are packaged inside the gem. These views will help you get started, but after some time you may want to change them. If this is the case, you just need to invoke the following generator, and it will copy all views to your application:

```
rails generate devise:views
```

If you have more than one Devise model in your application (such as `User` and `Admin`), you will notice that Devise uses the same views for all models. Fortunately, Devise offers an easy way to customize views. All you need to do is set `config.scoped_views = true` inside the `config/initializers/devise.rb` file.

After doing so, you will be able to have views based on the role like `users/sessions/new` and `admins/sessions/new`. If no view is found within the scope, Devise will use the default view at `devise/sessions/new`. You can also use the generator to generate scoped views:

```
rails generate devise:views users
```

If you would like to generate only a few sets of views, like the ones for the `registerable` and `confirmable` module,
you can pass a list of views to the generator with the `-v` flag.

```
rails generate devise:views -v registrations confirmations
```

### Configuring controllers

If the customization at the views level is not enough, you can customize each controller by following these steps:

1. Create your custom controllers using the generator which requires a scope:

   ```
   rails generate devise:controllers [scope]
   ```

   If you specify `users` as the scope, controllers will be created in `app/controllers/users/`.
   And the sessions controller will look like this:

   ```
   class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
     # GET /resource/sign_in
     # def new
     #   super
     # end
     ...
   end
   ```

   Use the `-c` flag to specify one or more controllers, for example: `rails generate devise:controllers users -c sessions`
2. Tell the router to use this controller:

   ```
   devise_for :users, controllers: { sessions: 'users/sessions' }
   ```
3. Recommended but not required: copy (or move) the views from `devise/sessions` to `users/sessions`. Rails will continue using the views from `devise/sessions` due to inheritance if you skip this step, but having the views matching the controller(s) keeps things consistent.
4. Finally, change or extend the desired controller actions.

   You can completely override a controller action:

   ```
   class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
     def create
       # custom sign-in code
     end
   end
   ```

   Or you can simply add new behavior to it:

   ```
   class Users::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
     def create
       super do |resource|
         BackgroundWorker.trigger(resource)
       end
     end
   end
   ```

   This is useful for triggering background jobs or logging events during certain actions.

Remember that Devise uses flash messages to let users know if sign in was successful or unsuccessful. Devise expects your application to call `flash[:notice]` and `flash[:alert]` as appropriate. Do not print the entire flash hash, print only specific keys. In some circumstances, Devise adds a `:timedout` key to the flash hash, which is not meant for display. Remove this key from the hash if you intend to print the entire hash.

### Configuring routes

Devise also ships with default routes. If you need to customize them, you should probably be able to do it through the devise\_for method. It accepts several options like :class\_name, :path\_prefix and so on, including the possibility to change path names for I18n:

```
devise_for :users, path: 'auth', path_names: { sign_in: 'login', sign_out: 'logout', password: 'secret', confirmation: 'verification', unlock: 'unblock', registration: 'register', sign_up: 'cmon_let_me_in' }
```

Be sure to check `devise_for` [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper%3Adevise_for) for details.

If you have the need for more deep customization, for instance to also allow "/sign\_in" besides "/users/sign\_in", all you need to do is create your routes normally and wrap them in a `devise_scope` block in the router:

```
devise_scope :user do
  get 'sign_in', to: 'devise/sessions#new'
end
```

This way, you tell Devise to use the scope `:user` when "/sign\_in" is accessed. Notice `devise_scope` is also aliased as `as` in your router.

Please note: You will still need to add `devise_for` in your routes in order to use helper methods such as `current_user`.

```
devise_for :users, skip: :all
```

### Hotwire/Turbo

Devise integrates with Hotwire/Turbo by treating such requests as navigational, and configuring certain responses for errors and redirects to match the expected behavior. New apps are generated with the following response configuration by default, and existing apps may opt-in by adding the config to their Devise initializers:

```
Devise.setup do |config|
  # ...
  # When using Devise with Hotwire/Turbo, the http status for error responses
  # and some redirects must match the following. The default in Devise for existing
  # apps is `200 OK` and `302 Found` respectively, but new apps are generated with
  # these new defaults that match Hotwire/Turbo behavior.
  # Note: These might become the new default in future versions of Devise.
  config.responder.error_status = :unprocessable_entity
  config.responder.redirect_status = :see_other
end
```

**Important**: these custom responses require the `responders` gem version to be `3.1.0` or higher, please make sure you update it if you're going to use this configuration. Check [this upgrade guide](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To%3A-Upgrade-to-Devise-4.9.0-%5BHotwire-Turbo-integration%5D) for more info.

*Note*: the above statuses configuration may become the default for Devise in a future release.

There are a couple other changes you might need to make in your app to work with Hotwire/Turbo, if you're migrating from rails-ujs:

* The `data-confirm` option that adds a confirmation modal to buttons/forms before submission needs to change to `data-turbo-confirm`, so that Turbo handles those appropriately.
* The `data-method` option that sets the request method for link submissions needs to change to `data-turbo-method`. This is not necessary for `button_to` or `form`s since Turbo can handle those.

If you're setting up Devise to sign out via `:delete`, and you're using links (instead of buttons wrapped in a form) to sign out with the `method: :delete` option, they will need to be updated as described above. (Devise does not provide sign out links/buttons in its shared views.)

Make sure to inspect your views looking for those, and change appropriately.

### I18n

Devise uses flash messages with I18n, in conjunction with the flash keys :notice and :alert. To customize your app, you can set up your locale file:

```
en:
  devise:
    sessions:
      signed_in: 'Signed in successfully.'
```

You can also create distinct messages based on the resource you've configured using the singular name given in routes:

```
en:
  devise:
    sessions:
      user:
        signed_in: 'Welcome user, you are signed in.'
      admin:
        signed_in: 'Hello admin!'
```

The Devise mailer uses a similar pattern to create subject messages:

```
en:
  devise:
    mailer:
      confirmation_instructions:
        subject: 'Hello everybody!'
        user_subject: 'Hello User! Please confirm your email'
      reset_password_instructions:
        subject: 'Reset instructions'
```

Take a look at our locale file to check all available messages. You may also be interested in one of the many translations that are available on our wiki:

<https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/I18n>

Caution: Devise Controllers inherit from ApplicationController. If your app uses multiple locales, you should be sure to set I18n.locale in ApplicationController.

### Test helpers

Devise includes some test helpers for controller and integration tests.
In order to use them, you need to include the respective module in your test
cases/specs.

### Controller tests

Controller tests require that you include `Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers` on
your test case or its parent `ActionController::TestCase` superclass.
For Rails versions prior to 5, include `Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers` instead, since the superclass
for controller tests was changed to ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
(for more details, see the [Integration tests](#integration-tests) section).

```
class PostsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers # Rails >= 5
end
```

```
class PostsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  include Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers # Rails < 5
end
```

If you're using RSpec, you can put the following inside a file named
`spec/support/devise.rb` or in your `spec/spec_helper.rb` (or
`spec/rails_helper.rb` if you are using `rspec-rails`):

```
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers, type: :controller
  config.include Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers, type: :view
end
```

Just be sure that this inclusion is made *after* the `require 'rspec/rails'` directive.

Now you are ready to use the `sign_in` and `sign_out` methods on your controller
tests:

```
sign_in @user
sign_in @user, scope: :admin
```

If you are testing Devise internal controllers or a controller that inherits
from Devise's, you need to tell Devise which mapping should be used before a
request. This is necessary because Devise gets this information from the router,
but since controller tests do not pass through the router, it needs to be stated
explicitly. For example, if you are testing the user scope, simply use:

```
test 'GET new' do
  # Mimic the router behavior of setting the Devise scope through the env.
  @request.env['devise.mapping'] = Devise.mappings[:user]

  # Use the sign_in helper to sign in a fixture `User` record.
  sign_in users(:alice)

  get :new

  # assert something
end
```

### Integration tests

Integration test helpers are available by including the
`Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers` module.

```
class PostsTests < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers
end
```

Now you can use the following `sign_in` and `sign_out` methods in your integration
tests:

```
sign_in users(:bob)
sign_in users(:bob), scope: :admin

sign_out :user
```

RSpec users can include the `IntegrationHelpers` module on their `:feature` specs.

```
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers, type: :feature
end
```

Unlike controller tests, integration tests do not need to supply the
`devise.mapping` `env` value, as the mapping can be inferred by the routes that
are executed in your tests.

You can read more about testing your Rails controllers with RSpec in the wiki:

* [https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Test-controllers-with-Rails-(and-RSpec)](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To%3A-Test-controllers-with-Rails-%28and-RSpec%29)

### OmniAuth

Devise comes with OmniAuth support out of the box to authenticate with other providers. To use it, simply specify your OmniAuth configuration in `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```
config.omniauth :github, 'APP_ID', 'APP_SECRET', scope: 'user,public_repo'
```

You can read more about OmniAuth support in the wiki:

* [https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/OmniAuth%3A-Overview)

### Configuring multiple models

Devise allows you to set up as many Devise models as you want. If you want to have an Admin model with just authentication and timeout features, in addition to the User model above, just run:

```
# Create a migration with the required fields
create_table :admins do |t|
  t.string :email
  t.string :encrypted_password
  t.timestamps null: false
end

# Inside your Admin model
devise :database_authenticatable, :timeoutable

# Inside your routes
devise_for :admins

# Inside your protected controller
before_action :authenticate_admin!

# Inside your controllers and views
admin_signed_in?
current_admin
admin_session
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the Devise generator.

Keep in mind that those models will have completely different routes. They **do not** and **cannot** share the same controller for sign in, sign out and so on. In case you want to have different roles sharing the same actions, we recommend that you use a role-based approach, by either providing a role column or using a dedicated gem for authorization.

### Active Job Integration

If you are using Active Job to deliver Action Mailer messages in the
background through a queuing back-end, you can send Devise emails through your
existing queue by overriding the `send_devise_notification` method in your model.

```
def send_devise_notification(notification, *args)
  devise_mailer.send(notification, self, *args).deliver_later
end
```

### Password reset tokens and Rails logs

If you enable the [Recoverable](http://rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/devise/main/Devise/Models/Recoverable) module, note that a stolen password reset token could give an attacker access to your application. Devise takes effort to generate random, secure tokens, and stores only token digests in the database, never plaintext. However the default logging behavior in Rails can cause plaintext tokens to leak into log files:

1. Action Mailer logs the entire contents of all outgoing emails to the DEBUG level. Password reset tokens delivered to users in email will be leaked.
2. Active Job logs all arguments to every enqueued job at the INFO level. If you configure Devise to use `deliver_later` to send password reset emails, password reset tokens will be leaked.

Rails sets the production logger level to INFO by default. Consider changing your production logger level to WARN if you wish to prevent tokens from being leaked into your logs. In `config/environments/production.rb`:

```
config.log_level = :warn
```

### Other ORMs

Devise supports ActiveRecord (default) and Mongoid. To select another ORM, simply require it in the initializer file.

### Rails API Mode

Rails 5+ has a built-in [API Mode](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) which optimizes Rails for use as an API (only). Devise is *somewhat* able to handle applications that are built in this mode without additional modifications in the sense that it should not raise exceptions and the like. But some issues may still arise during `development`/`testing`, as we still don't know the full extent of this compatibility. (For more information, see [issue #4947](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4947/))

#### Supported Authentication Strategies

API-only applications don't support browser-based authentication via cookies, which is devise's default. Yet, devise can still provide authentication out of the box in those cases with the `http_authenticatable` strategy, which uses HTTP Basic Auth and authenticates the user on each request. (For more info, see this wiki article for [How To: Use HTTP Basic Authentication](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To%3A-Use-HTTP-Basic-Authentication))

The devise default for HTTP Auth is disabled, so it will need to be enabled in the devise initializer for the database strategy:

```
config.http_authenticatable = [:database]
```

This restriction does not limit you from implementing custom warden strategies, either in your application or via gem-based extensions for devise.
A common authentication strategy for APIs is token-based authentication. For more information on extending devise to support this type of authentication and others, see the wiki article for [Simple Token Authentication Examples and alternatives](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To%3A-Simple-Token-Authentication-Example#alternatives) or this blog post on [Custom authentication methods with Devise](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/01/custom-authentication-methods-with-devise/).

#### Testing

API Mode changes the order of the middleware stack, and this can cause problems for `Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers`. This problem usually surfaces as an `undefined method `[]=' for nil:NilClass` error when using integration test helpers, such as `#sign_in`. The solution is simply to reorder the middlewares by adding the following to test.rb:

```
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before Warden::Manager, ActionDispatch::Cookies
Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before Warden::Manager, ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore
```

For a deeper understanding of this, review [this issue](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/4696).

Additionally be mindful that without views supported, some email-based flows from Confirmable, Recoverable and Lockable are not supported directly at this time.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
