Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-8783:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in `tif_luv.c` within the libtiff library when processing crafted TIFF images. Specifically, this occurs during the decoding of LogL compressed TIFF images that have an invalid number of samples per pixel.
*   **Weaknesses:** Incorrect handling of malformed or invalid input data, specifically when processing a LogL compressed TIFF image with more than one sample per pixel. The code reads beyond the allocated memory boundary.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application processing the crafted TIFF image. In some scenarios, memory corruption and arbitrary code execution are possible.

**2. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Network (Remote)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to send a malicious TIFF image file to a vulnerable application or a system that uses the affected libtiff library. The attacker needs to craft a malformed TIFF image file in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Attacker Position:** No authentication is required, so an attacker with network access to a vulnerable system can exploit this flaw.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerability lies in `tif_luv.c`.
*   The issue arises when the library encounters a LogL compressed TIFF image that claims to have a number of samples per pixel other than one. The affected code path fails to properly handle this invalid input data, resulting in out-of-bounds reads.
*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the number of samples per pixel is valid, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read from occurring.

**4. Affected Products/Components:**

*   libtiff library
*   Applications utilizing the libtiff library to process TIFF images (various OS such as Oracle Linux, Oracle VM, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, openSUSE, and Ubuntu).
*   Specific tools like bmp2tiff, pal2rgb, thumbnail, tiff2bw, tiff2pdf, tiffcrop, tiffdither, tiffsplit, and tiff2rgba are also affected.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The severity of this vulnerability is generally considered moderate. However, if assertions are disabled in the build (as they are in some non-debug builds) the vulnerability can lead to exploitation beyond a denial of service.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who can provide a crafted TIFF image file to the vulnerable system or application (typically via network).
*   The fix is to apply security updates provided by affected vendors. These updates include checks on the number of samples per pixel to prevent out-of-bounds access during processing.

**In Summary:** CVE-2015-8783 describes an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libtiff, exploitable through crafted TIFF images. This can lead to a denial-of-service, potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed by implementing proper validation of input data and is mitigated by security patches provided by vendors like Oracle, Red Hat, Debian, openSUSE, and Ubuntu.
