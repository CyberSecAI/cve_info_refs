  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The click install process did not properly sanitize file paths within the data.tar.gz archive of click packages. It assumed that all paths started with './', which was not enforced. This allowed a malicious package to include files with paths like '.click', which could interfere with package installs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization of file paths.",
      "Assumption that paths in data.tar.gz start with './'",
      "Lack of proper filtering of illegitimate paths during installation"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted click package could be used to escalate privileges by tricking click into installing a lenient security policy for the installed application. This could also allow a remote attacker to gain unintended access to the system. An example of exploitation involved modifying the boot splash screen and gaining root access on Ubuntu Phones.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor could create a crafted click package including a 'data.tar.gz' archive with file paths lacking the './' prefix, then trick a user into installing it.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious click package and convince a user to install it. No special privileges are required before the attack."
