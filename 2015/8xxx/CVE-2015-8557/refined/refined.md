Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8557:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe use of string concatenation within the `_get_nix_font_path` function in Pygments' `FontManager`. Specifically, the function constructs a shell command using string formatting, directly embedding user-provided font names without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Shell Injection:** The core weakness is a shell injection vulnerability. Because the font name is directly incorporated into the command string, an attacker can inject malicious shell metacharacters (e.g., backticks, semicolons, pipes, etc.).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the process running Pygments. This means a complete compromise of the affected system is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted font name to an application that utilizes Pygments' image formatting capabilities. This would typically occur in web applications or services that use Pygments to render code snippets as images.
- **User-Controlled Font Name:** The attacker must be able to control the font name passed to the `FontManager` constructor. This suggests that the application utilizing Pygments must allow the user to specify the font name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to Control Font Name:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that determines the font name used by Pygments. This can be through form fields in web interfaces, API parameters or similar means.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippet is:

```python
def _get_nix_font_path(self, name, style):
    try:
        from commands import getstatusoutput
    except ImportError:
        from subprocess import getstatusoutput
    exit, out = getstatusoutput('fc-list "%s:style=%s" file' %
                                (name, style))
    if not exit:
        lines = out.splitlines()
        if lines:
            path = lines[0].strip().strip(':')
            return path
```
The `name` variable is directly embedded into the shell command string, thus enabling the shell injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in versions of Pygments from 1.2.2 to 2.0.2, but is fixed in later versions (2.0.2-r1 and later).
- The vulnerability is present if image formatters are used by the application that allows users to supply font names, and no packages shipped with RHEL expose a suitable vector for this attack.
-  Patches have been implemented to use `subprocess.Popen` instead of string formatting to construct the shell command.
- Some early patches used `shlex.quote` which also caused issues, but were not the final fix implemented in most distributions.
