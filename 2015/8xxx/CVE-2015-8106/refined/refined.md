Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the `CmdKeywords` function of `latex2rtf` when processing the `\keywords` command in a TeX file. The `keywords` variable, which stores the user-provided input from the `\keywords` command, is used as the format string in a call to `vsnprintf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is that user-controlled input is directly used as a format string in `vsnprintf`, allowing an attacker to manipulate the program's execution by injecting format specifiers.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `latex2rtf` software doesn't sanitize or validate the input from the `\keywords` command before using it in `fprintRTF`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious TeX file, an attacker can exploit the format string vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system running `latex2rtf`. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, allowing for data theft, installation of malware, and other malicious activities.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  As shown in the provided exploit, malformed input can cause the program to crash via a segmentation fault.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TeX File:** An attacker needs to create a specially crafted TeX file containing a malicious string within the `\keywords` command.
- **Command Line Execution:** The user must then process the malicious TeX file using the vulnerable `latex2rtf` command-line tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TeX file to a user running `latex2rtf`. This could involve social engineering or exploiting another vulnerability that allows the attacker to get a malicious file onto the target machine.
- The attacker has to know that the `latex2rtf` is used by a potential target.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `funct1.c` and `main.c` files.
- `CmdKeywords` function reads a string from user input through `getBraceParam()` function
- The retrieved string is then passed to `fprintRTF()`, which acts as a wrapper for `vsnprintf()`. The user provided string is passed to `vsnprintf()` as the format string argument.
- Example malicious input: `\keywords{%x%n%n%n}` which crashes the application, demonstrating exploitation.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `keywords` variable is treated as a string literal by passing "%s" as format specifier to `fprintRTF()` and then passing the `keywords` variable as the argument.
- The vulnerability was discovered through static analysis using Sparrow.
