Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions being set on journal files created by `systemd-journald`. Specifically, the `tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf` configuration file in `systemd` versions prior to 229 incorrectly configured the permissions of persistent journal files (`/var/log/journal/%m/system.journal`), making them world-readable. This was introduced by commit `a606871da508995f5ede113a8fc6538afd98966c` in v213.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the assignment of overly permissive read permissions to journal files, specifically the persistent journal files. This allowed any local user to read the files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local, unprivileged attacker could read sensitive system log entries stored in the world-readable journal files. This could include confidential information such as user activity, system events, and potentially credentials or other sensitive data logged by applications or services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have a user account on the affected system.
*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker could directly read the journal files using standard file system tools.
*   **`journalctl` tool:** The attacker could use the `journalctl --file=/path/to/archived/file` command to access the vulnerable archived files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   **No Elevated Privileges:** The attacker does not need root or other elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed for volatile journals by commit `176f2acf8dee45fee832fd2ab07243f63783a238` in v214, which stopped systemd from setting the world-readable bit but did not remove it from existing files. The fix for persistent journal files is in commit `afae249efa4774c6676738ac5de6aeb4daf4889f` in v229 which sets acls to restrict the access.
*   The vulnerability was present in systemd v213 and was fixed in v229.
*   The bug report [972612](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=972612) from SUSE bugzilla tracks the issue.
*   The SUSE security advisories provide patches for the vulnerability in their products.
*   The issue was fixed in openSUSE Leap 42.1 and openSUSE 13.2 by updates.
*   The vulnerability is related to another CVE-2014-9770, which also deals with weak permissions in journal files.
