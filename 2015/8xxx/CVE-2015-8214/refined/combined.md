SSA-763427: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in SIMATIC NET CP
Modules and TIM Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2015-11-27
2021-04-13
V1.5

SUMMARY

Siemens has released updates for Communication Processor (CP) module families CP 343-1/TIM 3V-
IE/TIM 4R-IE/CP 443-1 to resolve an authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated
users to perform administrative operations under certain conditions.

2021-04-13: Siemens has also added Proﬁbus devices (CP 342-5 / CP 443-5) to this advisory. For these
additional devices, the attacker must have network access to S7 Protocol Interface of the affected device
and the conﬁguration data of the CP must be stored on the CPU. Therefore, in this case the adapted
CVSS Vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.6)

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any speciﬁc mitigations or workarounds. Please follow General Security
Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Communication Processor (CP) modules of families SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 have been
designed to enable SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs for Ethernet communication.

Communication Processor (CP) modules of families SIMATIC NET CP 342-5 and CP 443-5 have been
designed to enable SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs for PROFIBUS DP/ FMS, S5-compatible, PG/OP and
S7 communication.

The TIM 3V-IE is a SINAUT ST7 communications module for the SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface
for SINAUT communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for SINAUT communication via an
IP-based network (WAN or LAN).

The TIM 3V-IE DNP3 communication module for SIMATIC S7-300 with an RS232 interface for DNP3
communication via a classic WAN and an RJ45 interface for DNP3 communication via a IP-based network
(WAN or LAN).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-8214

The implemented access protection level enforcement of the affected communication processors (CP)
could possibly allow unauthenticated users to perform administrative operations on the CPs if network
access (port 102/TCP) is available and the CPs’ conﬁguration was stored on their corresponding
CPUs.
