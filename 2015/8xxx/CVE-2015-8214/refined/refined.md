- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check for critical functions in the affected Siemens Communication Processor (CP) modules. This allows unauthenticated users to perform administrative operations. Specifically, the access protection level enforcement was not properly implemented.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication controls, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative operations on the affected CP modules. This includes the potential for complete compromise of the device, leading to unauthorized access to and manipulation of the industrial control system. The impact can range from disruption of services to potential damage to connected equipment.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is network access via port 102/TCP (S7 Protocol Interface), if the CP configuration is stored on the corresponding CPU. For Profibus devices (CP 342-5 / CP 443-5), an attacker needs network access to the S7 Protocol Interface and the configuration data of the CP must be stored on the CPU.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers require network access to the affected CP modules (Port 102/TCP), or to the S7 Protocol Interface of the device when the configuration data of the CP is stored on the CPU. No authentication is needed, so the attacker does not need prior access or credentials.
