Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8537:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 3529-1) explicitly lists `CVE-2015-8537` as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the Redmine security update, alongside CVE-2015-8474, CVE-2015-8346 and CVE-2015-8473. The commit message from Github also references "Information leak in Atom feed (#21419)", which aligns with the vulnerability description. This confirms the content is related to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an information leak in the Atom feed of the Redmine application. Specifically, the Atom feed was not correctly filtering out sensitive information related to custom fields.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The main weakness is the lack of proper access control or filtering when displaying custom fields in the Atom feed. This allows unauthorized users to potentially view sensitive data that they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is primarily information disclosure. Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information contained in the custom fields of issues, which could include details about projects, clients, or internal processes.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is accessing the Atom feed of the Redmine application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have access to the Redmine instance and be able to access the Atom feed. An attacker could potentially access the Atom feed without authentication if it is made public or if they know the user's RSS key.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying the `app/views/journals/index.builder` file to use `details_to_strings(change.visible_details, false)` instead of `details_to_strings(change.details, false)` . This ensures that only visible custom field details are included in the Atom feed.
*   The provided commit also includes a test case (`test/functional/journals_controller_test.rb`) to verify that the fix is working correctly.
*   The Redmine release notes (3.1.3, 3.0.7, and 2.6.9) also mention the fix for the potential data disclosure on the Atom feed.
