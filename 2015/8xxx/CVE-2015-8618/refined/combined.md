Subject: [security] Go security release v1.5.3

A security-related issue has been reported in Go's math/big package. The
issue was introduced in Go 1.5. We recommend that all users upgrade to Go
1.5.3, which fixes the issue. Go programs must be recompiled with Go 1.5.3
in order to receive the fix.

The Go team would like to thank Nick Craig-Wood for identifying the issue.

This issue can affect RSA computations in crypto/rsa, which is used by
crypto/tls. TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their RSA
private key due to this issue. Other protocol implementations that create
many RSA signatures could also be impacted in the same way.

Specifically, incorrect results in one part of the RSA Chinese Remainder
computation can cause the result to be incorrect in such a way that it
leaks one of the primes. While RSA blinding should prevent an attacker from
crafting specific inputs that trigger the bug, on 32-bit systems the bug
can be expected to occur at random around one in 2^26 times. Thus
collecting around 64 million signatures (of known data) from an affected
server should be enough to extract the private key used.

On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one in
2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit. Nonetheless, everyone is
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Go 1.6 will include include a change to double-check the RSA computation,
which is a generic countermeasure to this class of bug.

The CVE issue descriptions and fixes are linked below. Downloads are
available at <http://golang.org/dl> for all supported platforms.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2016-3959 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3959)

#### Description

The Verify function in crypto/dsa/dsa.go in Go before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.1 does not properly check parameters passed to the big integer library, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted public key to a program that uses HTTPS client certificates or SSH server libraries.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-8618 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8618)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=974232#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2016-04-06 09:44:54 UTC  ``` <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/12>  2. Go has an infinite loop in several big integer routines that makes Go programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.

Message-ID: <CA+s3sfFMSqi3-5b=4-=gx_nXYye=0oWuWtpwsgEe6mdiq8a_Ew@mail.gmail.com>
Date: Mon, 21 Dec 2015 16:07:45 +0000
From: Jason Buberel <jbuberel@...gle.com>
To: "oss-security@...ts.openwall.com" <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: CVE request for math/big.Exp

OSS-Security,

The Go open source project has received notification of an error in the
math/big library (<https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/>). The problem that was
identified is similar to CVE-2015-3193
<<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3193>>. The
vulnerability was introduced in the 1.5 release, and remains present in Go
1.5.1 and 1.5.2.

A fix for the issue has been applied to the master branch of the Go repo
under CL 17672 <<https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/17672/>>. We will
also be releasing Go 1.5.3 to fix this vulnerability.

We are requesting a CVE ID in order to coordinate updates with
distributions that include binary packages for the Go programming language.
We will also announce and request that all Go programs using the math/big
package that were compiled with version 1.5, 1.5.1, or 1.5.2 be recompiled
with  1.5.3 (when released) due to the static linking nature of the Go
toolchain.

Regards, jason

# math/big: incorrect result from Exp on 386 architecture #13515

## Description

[![@ncw](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4&size=48)](/ncw)[ncw](https://github.com/ncw)opened [on Dec 6, 2015](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13515#issue-120654457)
```
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/big"
)

func main() {
    A := new(big.Int)
    B := new(big.Int)
    P := new(big.Int)
    C := new(big.Int)
    A.SetUint64(0xAAAAAAAA00000000)
    B.SetUint64(0xAAAAAAAA00000000)
    P.SetUint64(0xFFFFFFFF00000001)
    C.Exp(A, B, P)
    fmt.Printf("0x%x ** 0x%x %% 0x%x = 0x%x\n", A, B, P, C)
}
```

I get different results whether I run it in amd64 mode or 386 mode

```
$ go run exptest.go
0xaaaaaaaa00000000 ** 0xaaaaaaaa00000000 % 0xffffffff00000001 = 0x1
$ GOARCH=386 go run exptest.go
0xaaaaaaaa00000000 ** 0xaaaaaaaa00000000 % 0xffffffff00000001 = 0xc1540908df2582c2

```

The first one is correct (you can verify this with python thus)

```
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct 14 2015, 16:09:02)
[GCC 5.2.1 20151010] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> pow(0xAAAAAAAA00000000 , 0xAAAAAAAA00000000 , 0xFFFFFFFF00000001)
1L

```

The [playground also gives the incorrect results](http://play.golang.org/p/tiPTR4Lo6s).

Tested with go 1.5.1 and tip

```
go version devel +b2963a5 Sun Dec 6 06:28:33 2015 +0000 linux/amd64
go version go1.5.1 linux/amd64

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-12-23 10:04:29 UTC  ``` via rh#1293448  Carry propagation in Int.Exp Montgomery function was found in golang's math/big library, similar to CVE-2015-3193. This issue was introduced in the 1.5 release and remains present in 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.  <https://github.com/golang/go/commit/4306352182bf94f86f0cfc6a8b0ed461cbf1d82c>  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/550>   References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1293448> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8618> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/564> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2015-12-23 10:06:50 UTC  ``` go 1.5 (1.5.1, 1.5.2) Affects openSUSE Tumbleweed only. Does not affect SLE. Does not affect openSUSE stable releases.  Assign to community maintainer. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2016-01-16 21:24:59 UTC  ``` <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-announce/MEATuOi_ei4>  "TLS servers on 32-bit systems could plausibly leak their RSA private key due to this issue."  "On 64-bit systems, the frequency of the bug is so low (less than one in 2^50) that it would be very difficult to exploit. Nonetheless, everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade." ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c9)  Flavio Castelli   2016-02-15 07:40:52 UTC  ``` Reassigning the bug to Jordi, who is working on pushing out the update.  @Jordi can you close the bug as soon as all our packages have been released by maintenance? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c10)  Jordi Massaguer   2016-03-02 17:19:03 UTC  ``` There is another bug for updating go to 1.5, which will update to the latest version (1.5.3), which includes this fix. I am marking it as a duplicate of this one.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 968949](show_bug.cgi?id=968949 "RESOLVED FIXED") *** ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c11)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2016-05-04 09:00:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (960151) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/393533> 42.1 / go ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=960151#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2016-05-18 12:14:01 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2016:1331-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
