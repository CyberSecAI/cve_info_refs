Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Int.Exp` function within the `math/big` library of the Go programming language. Specifically, it is a flaw in the Montgomery modular exponentiation implementation, where carry propagation is mishandled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Carry Propagation:** The core issue is that the Montgomery code used for modular exponentiation doesn't properly propagate carries, leading to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Output:** This carry propagation error causes the `Int.Exp` function to produce incorrect output when performing modular exponentiation with large integers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Key Leakage:** The most significant impact is the potential for leaking RSA private keys. Since the flawed `Int.Exp` function is used within the `crypto/rsa` package, which in turn is utilized by `crypto/tls`, TLS servers could leak their RSA private keys.
- **Impact on other RSA implementations:** Other protocol implementations that rely on repeated RSA signature generation could be vulnerable if they are using a flawed version of `math/big`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely. An attacker could potentially trigger the bug through network traffic by interacting with an affected server.
- **Specifically, TLS servers using RSA on 32-bit systems are vulnerable.**
- Although not directly user-exploitable, other applications could be vulnerable if they make intensive use of modular exponentiation via `math/big`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a vulnerable server.
- **Known Data for Signatures:** For RSA private key extraction, an attacker needs to collect many RSA signatures (of known data) from an affected server.
- **32 bit System**: The exploit is most effective on 32-bit systems, which are susceptible to the bug approximately once in every 2^26 operations. 64-bit systems are also vulnerable, but with much lower frequency (less than once in 2^50 operations), making it much more difficult to exploit.
- **Target an affected server:** The attacker needs a TLS server or RSA implementation built with the vulnerable library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Go 1.5 and was present in versions 1.5.1 and 1.5.2.
*   Go 1.5.3 and later versions contain a fix.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nick Craig-Wood.
*   The fix involves correcting the carry propagation in the Montgomery code.
*   Go 1.6 includes a double-check mechanism for RSA computations, which is a generic countermeasure.
*   Recompiling Go programs built with the affected versions of Go is necessary to apply the fix.

This information provides a more detailed description of the vulnerability than the original CVE description, which only mentions that it "mishandles carry propagation" and "makes it easier for attackers to obtain private RSA keys."
