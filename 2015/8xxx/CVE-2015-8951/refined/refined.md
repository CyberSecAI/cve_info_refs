{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Qualcomm sound driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. The specific nature of the vulnerability within the sound driver is not detailed, but it involves a flaw that permits unauthorized code execution in a privileged context.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in arbitrary code execution within the kernel context. This can lead to a local permanent device compromise, potentially requiring reflashing of the operating system to repair the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a local malicious application. This means an attacker needs to have already installed a malicious app on the device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to install a malicious application on the target device. The malicious application needs to be able to exploit the vulnerability in the Qualcomm sound driver."
