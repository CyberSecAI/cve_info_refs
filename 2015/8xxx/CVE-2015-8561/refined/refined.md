Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-8561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of integer values within the F1BookView ActiveX control of Schneider Electric's ProClima software. Several methods within this ActiveX control, namely `AttachToSS`, `CopyRangeEx`, `CopyAll`, `CopyRange`, and `SwapTables`, accept integer values and interpret these as memory addresses of structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The ActiveX control does not validate the provided integer values, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary memory addresses.
*   **Memory Corruption:** By providing attacker-controlled memory addresses, an attacker can force the application to access arbitrary memory locations. This can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Code Injection:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable machine in the context of the process running ProClima.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful RCE can allow an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage hosting the malicious ActiveX control or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** According to the ICS-CERT advisory, the vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker with low technical skill.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the exploit to the target machine, typically over a network or through a malicious document.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are actually multiple vulnerabilities within the ActiveX control, all stemming from the same issue of unchecked memory address interpretation.
*   The provided data indicates a CVSS v2 score of 6.8, with the vector string of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P. Also, it provides a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3, with vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
*   Schneider Electric released an update to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against the vulnerability with specific digital vaccine filters.
