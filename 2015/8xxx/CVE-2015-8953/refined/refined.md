Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8953:

*   **Relates to CVE:** Yes, the provided content is related to CVE-2015-8953.
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A dentry reference leak in the `ovl_copy_up_locked()` function within the overlayfs implementation. Specifically, when the function exits through the `out_cleanup` label after calling `ovl_cleanup()`, the reference count on `newdentry` is not decremented, leading to a leak.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Dentry reference leak. The code path `out_cleanup` does not properly release the `newdentry` object, leading to resource exhaustion when repeatedly triggered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Dentry leaks can lead to resource exhaustion, eventually causing a denial of service (DoS).
    *   The bugzilla entry mentions that an attacker can leak file resources, and repeating this for all available inodes and memory will create a DoS.
    *   The openwall description mentions that in a DevOps environment, this can lead to a local DoS, by exhausting kernel resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Create a large file in a lower overlayfs layer.
    *   Overlay an upper layer that is too small (e.g., on tmpfs).
    *   Induce a copy-up operation by opening the file for writing. This triggers the error condition and the dentry leak.
    *   In a containerized environment (Docker), a crafted image can create a large file within the container's filesystem, triggering the vulnerability when the file is accessed.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create and mount overlayfs filesystems.
    *   In a containerized environment, an attacker with access to a developer account and the ability to run Docker images can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerability lies in the `ovl_copy_up_locked()` function.
    *   The fix involves changing the `out_cleanup` exit path to jump to `out2`, which properly handles the `newdentry` reference count.
