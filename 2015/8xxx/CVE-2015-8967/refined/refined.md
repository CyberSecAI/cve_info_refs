Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `sys_call_table` in the ARM64 Linux kernel was not declared as constant (`const`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Writable Syscall Table:** The absence of the `const` qualifier meant that the system call table, a critical kernel data structure, was writable.
- **Potential for Modification:** Without marking the table as constant it was possible to overwrite the entries in the table. This could allow an attacker with kernel access to redirect syscalls to malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying entries in the syscall table an attacker could hijack system calls to execute malicious code within the kernel context.
- **Elevation of Privileges:** An attacker achieving arbitrary code execution in the kernel could gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:**  A local application that has gained elevated privileges or kernel access can modify the syscall table.
- The commit message indicates the vulnerability could be exploited through "accidental or deliberate" modifications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Kernel Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the kernel to modify memory directly. This could be achieved through a prior exploit or an already compromised system with root access or a compromised privileged process.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix was to mark the `sys_call_table` as `const`, which places it in the `.rodata` section and makes it read-only in systems with strict page permissions.

- The provided text also indicates: "In the absence of strict page permissions, there should be no functional change." This highlights that systems without such protection in place would still be vulnerable.

- The Android Security Bulletin indicates this is rated as "High" severity because it first requires exploitation of a separate vulnerability.

- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the Linux kernel commit `c623b33b4e9599c6ac5076f7db7369eb9869aa04`.
