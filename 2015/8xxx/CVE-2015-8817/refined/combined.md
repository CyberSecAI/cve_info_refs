## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2670)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.6.0). (BZ#1386383)

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built using 'address\_space\_translate' to map an address to a MemoryRegionSection. The flaw could occur while doing pci\_dma\_read/write calls, resulting in an out-of-bounds read-write access error. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance (denial of service). (CVE-2015-8817, CVE-2015-8818)

Red Hat would like to thank Donghai Zdh of Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2704)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 7.0 (Kilo) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.6.0). (BZ#1386381)

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built using 'address\_space\_translate' to map an address to a MemoryRegionSection. The flaw could occur while doing pci\_dma\_read/write calls, resulting in an out-of-bounds read-write access error. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance (denial of service). (CVE-2015-8817, CVE-2015-8818)

Red Hat would like to thank Donghai Zdh of Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6.0 (Juno) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.6.0). (BZ#1386379)

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built using 'address\_space\_translate' to map an address to a MemoryRegionSection. The flaw could occur while doing pci\_dma\_read/write calls, resulting in an out-of-bounds read-write access error. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance (denial of service). (CVE-2015-8817, CVE-2015-8818)

Red Hat would like to thank Donghai Zdh of Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

Subject: CVE request Qemu: OOB access in address_space_rw leads to segmentation
 fault

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built to use 'address_space_translate' to map an address to a
MemoryRegionSection is vulnerable to an OOB r/w access issue. It could occur
while doing pci_dma_read/write calls. Affects Qemu versions >= 1.6.0 and <=
2.3.1.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance
resulting in DoS.

We understand that the listed patches are to be used together, but the
changes were announced at different times and thus multiple CVE IDs
are needed.

> Qemu emulator built to use 'address_space_translate' to map an address to a

> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=23820dbfc79d1c9dce090b4c555994f2bb6a69b3>

There are all about the same code changes, originally written in March
2015. The issue appears to have security relevance on its own. Use
CVE-2015-8817.

> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=e4a511f8cc6f4a46d409fb5c9f72c38ba45f8d83>

As far as we can tell, this is a functionality fix, not a security
fix. It doesn't have a CVE ID. (We understand that it does belong in
the listed set of upstream commits anyway.)

> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=965eb2fcdfe919ecced6c34803535ad32dc1249c>

As far as we can tell, this one isn't really a security fix and may
have introduced new bugs that were addressed later. It also doesn't
have a CVE ID. (We understand that it does belong in the listed set of
upstream commits anyway.)

> <http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b242e0e0e2969c044a318e56f7988bbd84de1f63>

This one is from July 2015 and has security relevance on its own. Use
CVE-2015-8818.

## [Qemu-stable] [PATCH for v2.3.1] exec: Respect as\_translate\_internal len

---

| **From**: | P J P |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | [Qemu-stable] [PATCH for v2.3.1] exec: Respect as\_translate\_internal length clamp |
| **Date**: | Wed, 27 Jan 2016 15:18:17 +0530 |

---

```
From: Peter Crosthwaite <address@hidden>

address_space_translate_internal will clamp the *plen length argument
based on the size of the memory region being queried. The iommu walker
logic in addresss_space_translate was ignoring this by discarding the
post fn call value of *plen. Fix by just always using *plen as the
length argument throughout the fn, removing the len local variable.

This fixes a bootloader bug when a single elf section spans multiple
QEMU memory regions.

## Synopsis

Moderate: qemu-kvm-rhev security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2671)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.6.0). (BZ#1386385)

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built using 'address\_space\_translate' to map an address to a MemoryRegionSection. The flaw could occur while doing pci\_dma\_read/write calls, resulting in an out-of-bounds read-write access error. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance (denial of service). (CVE-2015-8817, CVE-2015-8818)

Red Hat would like to thank Donghai Zdh of Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2706)

## Topic

An update for qemu-kvm-rhev is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 (Icehouse) for RHEL 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev package provides the user-space component for running virtual machines using KVM in environments managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: qemu-kvm-rhev (2.6.0). (BZ#1386377)

Security Fix(es):

* An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built using 'address\_space\_translate' to map an address to a MemoryRegionSection. The flaw could occur while doing pci\_dma\_read/write calls, resulting in an out-of-bounds read-write access error. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to crash the guest instance (denial of service). (CVE-2015-8817, CVE-2015-8818)

Red Hat would like to thank Donghai Zdh of Alibaba Inc. for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, shut down all running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down, start them again for this update to take effect.
