Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from a missing check in the `MWOAuthDataStore::lookup_token()` function within the MediaWiki OAuth extension. Specifically, when looking up an access token, the code retrieved the consumer associated with the access token but failed to verify if the consumer ID matched the consumer ID of the provided OAuth signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Authorization:** The core issue was that the OAuth implementation did not properly validate the consumer associated with a given access token. This allowed an attacker with a valid access token to impersonate another OAuth consumer.
*   **Missing Verification:** The lack of a check to ensure the consumer ID associated with the access token matched the consumer ID used to sign the API request is the primary vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Impersonation:** An attacker who gained access to a valid user's access token could make API requests on behalf of that user, using a different OAuth consumer that they controlled. This effectively allows the attacker to impersonate another consumer for an existing user's access token.
*   **Unauthorized API Access:** By using a different consumer, the attacker could potentially access the API with the permissions of the compromised user while circumventing the intended authorization process. Although, the user's original grants still applied from the authorized consumer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stolen Access Tokens:** The primary attack vector is the compromise of a user's access token. If an attacker could obtain this token, they could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Consumer:** An attacker could register their own OAuth consumer, and then use a stolen access token from a legitimate user to perform actions on that user's behalf via the attacker's consumer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Access Token:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid access token that belongs to a legitimate user.
*   **Registered OAuth Consumer:** The attacker needs to have a registered OAuth consumer (identified by its consumer key and secret).
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the MediaWiki instance.
