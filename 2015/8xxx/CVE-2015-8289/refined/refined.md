Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8289:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass issue in the password recovery page of Netgear D6000 and D3600 routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The `/cgi-bin/passrec.asp` password recovery page allows an attacker to view the administrator password in cleartext by accessing the source code of the page. This bypasses the normal authentication process.
*   **Cleartext Storage:**  The administrator password is not stored securely and is exposed in the clear text within the source code of the password recovery page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrator Access:** An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can obtain the administrator password, thereby gaining full control over the router.
*   **Network Compromise:**  With administrator access, the attacker can modify router settings, potentially compromising the entire network.
*  **Data Breach:**  The attacker could also potentially access sensitive data or use the router as a pivot point for further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they can access the `/cgi-bin/passrec.asp` page. This access can be achieved if remote management is enabled on the router or if the attacker is on the internal network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable router. This could be via the local network, or remotely if remote management is enabled on the router.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface to reach the `/cgi-bin/passrec.asp` page and view the source code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Netgear D6000 and D3600 routers with firmware versions 1.0.0.47 and 1.0.0.49.
*   Netgear has released a firmware update (version 1.0.0.59) to address this issue by removing the password recovery page.
* The associated CVE-2015-8288 relates to hard-coded cryptographic keys in the firmware, which is a separate issue but affects the same devices.
