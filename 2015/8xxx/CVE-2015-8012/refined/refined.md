Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `assert()` statements in code paths that can be reached during normal operation when processing network packets. Specifically, the `assert()` was checking if the size of a management address received in a network packet was within allowed limits. If an attacker sends a crafted packet with a larger than expected management address, the assert would trigger, causing the `lldpd` daemon to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Error Handling:** The code used assertions to check for conditions that should be handled gracefully. Assertions are meant for debugging and are typically disabled in production builds. Relying on assertions for error handling leads to unexpected program termination when the assertion fails.
-   **Lack of Input Validation**:  Although there was some validation of size via `assert` which is later replaced by a check, the core issue is the lack of robust handling of malformed packets specifically with regards to handling address sizes, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending malformed packets that trigger the assertion failures, leading to the lldpd daemon crashing.  This disrupts the functionality of systems relying on lldpd.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** Attackers send crafted network packets with larger-than-expected management addresses.
-   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely, as the vulnerability exists in the packet processing logic of lldpd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send malicious packets to the machine running the vulnerable `lldpd` service.
-   **Packet crafting:**  The attacker would need to be able to craft network packets, specifically LLDP, CDP, EDP, or SONMP packets with a management address TLV that is of an invalid size.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided commit diffs show the removal of the `assert()` and its replacement with a check and log message.
- The commit message "protocols: don't use assert on paths that can be reached" clearly explains the fix implemented.
- The CVE assignment message confirms this as a separate issue from the buffer overflow fixed by CVE-2015-8011 and indicates the code changes address CWE-617 which is Reachable Assertion.
