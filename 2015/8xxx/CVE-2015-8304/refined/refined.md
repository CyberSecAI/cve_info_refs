Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8304:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow within a Huawei smartphone, which allows an attacker to escalate privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow, which is a common vulnerability where an arithmetic operation results in a value exceeding the maximum representable value of the data type. This leads to incorrect calculations or memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the device. This grants the attacker complete control over the device.
*   **System/Camera Privilege:** Before achieving root, the attacker needs system or camera privileges, which they can gain by tricking the user into installing a malicious application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** The primary attack vector is a malicious application that the attacker tricks the user into installing. This app is crafted to trigger the integer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attack requires the user to install the malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create and distribute a malicious application:** The attacker must be able to create an Android application that can exploit the integer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick the user into installing the malicious application.
*   **Initial System/Camera Privilege:** The attacker needs to gain system or camera privilege through the malicious app before escalating to root.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Huawei P7 smartphones with versions earlier than P7-L07 V100R001C01B606.
*   Huawei released a patch (P7-L07 V100R001C01B606) to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Huawei by Xiao Peng and Yang Chengming of the Alibaba Mobile Security Team.
*   CVSSv2 scores are provided: Base Score is 6.2 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), Temporal Score: 5.1 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C).
