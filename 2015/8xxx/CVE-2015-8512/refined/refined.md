{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The lockscreen delay mechanism, intended to slow down brute-force attacks, was flawed. The delay was only enforced *after* a failed passcode attempt. When the lockscreen app was closed (e.g., by pressing the home button) and reopened, the delay timer was reset.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent state management between the LockScreen and LockScreenInputPad components.",
      "Lack of persistence for the delay timer across lockscreen app restarts.",
      "The lockscreen input pad clearing the error state upon closing of the app rather than checking if a delay was currently active in the LockScreen."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access could bypass the intended passcode delay, making it significantly easier to brute-force the PIN, rendering the tar-pitting mechanism ineffective.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the Firefox OS device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Physical access to the device.",
        "Basic understanding of how to interact with the device's lock screen."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The fix involved rewriting parts of the lockscreen's messaging and state handling. Now all state and timeouts related to passcode checking are maintained by LockScreen which signals LockScreenInputManager with three distinct messages of failure, reset, and success. The LockScreenInputPad now always aware of a passcode error delay ongoing in LockScreen."
