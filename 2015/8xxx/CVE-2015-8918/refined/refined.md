Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8918:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `archive_string_append` function in `archive_string.c` of libarchive. Specifically, it's due to an "overlapping memcpy".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core issue is an overlapping memcpy operation. This occurs when the source and destination memory regions of a `memcpy` operation overlap. This leads to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the application using libarchive. This is achieved through a crafted CAB archive file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by providing a crafted CAB file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply the target system with a specially crafted CAB file that triggers the overlapping memcpy in `archive_string_append`.
- No specific authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
