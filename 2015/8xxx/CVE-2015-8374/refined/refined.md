{
  "CVE-2015-8374": {
    "Root cause": "The Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled compressed inline extents on truncation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of compressed inline extents during truncation.",
      "Failure to discard truncated data, leading to potential information leakage."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information by reading the truncated data. Additionally, data loss or corruption could occur.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the system.",
       "Truncating files with compressed inline extents."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with ability to truncate files, or a user performing clone operations."
  }
}
