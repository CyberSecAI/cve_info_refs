Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security improvements made in Textpattern version 4.6.0, which addresses the issues related to the specified CVE:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause of the vulnerabilities addressed in this commit was the insecure handling of passwords and password reset requests. Specifically:

*   Plaintext passwords were being emailed to users.
*   Cryptographic hashes used for confirmation links were weak and potentially exposed user IDs.
*   Password reset requests had no proper expiration mechanism.
*   Password input boxes were not masked, leading to usability issues.
*   Token storage and retrieval were not handled in a dedicated manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present (Prior to Fix):**

*   **Plaintext Password Exposure:** Sending passwords via email exposed them to interception during transit or storage in email systems.
*   **Weak Cryptographic Hashes:** Using weak hashes for confirmation links could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
*   **Lack of Password Reset Expiration:** Without an expiration mechanism, reset requests could be used indefinitely.
*  **Insecure Cookie generation**: The cookie used for user login used `md5()` which is insecure. The cookie also used a predictable method of generating a hash.
*   **Unmasked Password Input Boxes:** Displaying password characters directly in input fields created a poor user experience and could increase the risk of shoulder surfing.
*   **Abuse of `txp_discuss_nonce`:** Using the `txp_discuss_nonce` for token storage was inappropriate and could cause conflicts with its original purpose.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to user accounts by intercepting plaintext passwords or manipulating confirmation links.
*   **Account Takeover:**  An attacker could use an unexpired password reset link to change a user's password and gain control of their account.
*   **Information Disclosure:** User IDs might be exposed through weak cryptographic hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting emails containing plaintext passwords.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Tampering with weak confirmation links to bypass security checks.
*   **Session Hijacking**: An attacker could potentially hijack a user session due to the predictable cookie generation.
*   **Shoulder Surfing:** Visually obtaining unmasked passwords displayed in input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The ability to intercept network traffic (for man-in-the-middle attacks).
*   **Access to Email:**  The ability to access or intercept email communications.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Cryptography:**  The ability to understand and manipulate weak cryptographic hashes.
*   **User proximity**: For obtaining passwords via 'shoulder surfing'.

**Security Improvements (Mitigations):**

The commit implements several security improvements:

*   **No more emailing plaintext passwords:** Password changes and reset requests are handled immediately on the login/admin panels.
*   **Stronger cryptographic hashes:**  Confirmation links now use stronger cryptographic hashes that don't leak user ID information.
*   **Secure token management:** Hashes are securely tethered to the user account and auto-expire when logging in or generating a new request.  The timeout window is 20 minutes by default for answering reset requests and can be configured.
*   **Masked Password Input Boxes:** Password input boxes are now masked, which improves UX and security.
*   **Dedicated `txp_token` table:** A dedicated table is introduced for handling token-based storage and retrieval.
*   **Secure Cookie generation**: The commit has implemented a better nonce/salt mechanism using  `ripemd256` to improve security for cookie generation, with the salt length being `64` characters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit introduces new constants in `constants.php`, such as `HASHING_ALGORITHM`, `SALT_LENGTH`, and `RESET_EXPIRY_MINUTES`, to control hashing and token expiration settings.
*   It addresses issue [#565](https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/issues/565)
*   The commit also adds a 'show password' checkbox next to the password input which lets the user view the password, but by default they are masked.

**Conclusion:**
The commit addresses multiple security vulnerabilities related to password handling and reset requests in Textpattern, using stronger cryptography, token management, and better user experience practices.
