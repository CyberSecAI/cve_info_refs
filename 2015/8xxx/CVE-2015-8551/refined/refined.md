```
(CVE) ID: CVE-2015-8551
```

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The PCI backend driver in Xen does not properly validate the device state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
-   Lack of proper sanity checks on the device's state in the Xen PCI backend driver.
-   Missing check to verify if a device has memory decoding enabled.

**Impact of exploitation**:
-   Denial of service (host OS crash) due to NULL pointer exceptions.
-   Denial of service (panic) via a crafted USB device descriptor, specifically a nonzero `bInterfaceNumber` value.
-   Potential for unspecified other impact due to invalid memory access.

**Attack vectors**:
-   Physically proximate attackers.
-   Local guest OS administrators with access to physical PCI devices.
-   A crafted sequence of XEN\_PCI\_OP\_\* operations in a guest OS to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
-   Physically proximate access to insert malicious USB device or,
-   Local guest OS administrator privileges within a Xen environment.
-  Ability to create and utilize a crafted application to send malicious requests to the driver.
