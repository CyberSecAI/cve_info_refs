  "cve": "CVE-2015-8620",
  "description": "A heap overflow bug in the Avast Virtualization kernel mode driver (aswSnx.sys) allows a local attacker to elevate his privileges from any account type and execute code as SYSTEM.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Avast virtualization kernel mode driver (aswSnx.sys) does not validate the length of absolute Unicode file paths in some of the IOCTL requests that it receives from userland.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input (Unicode file path length)",
      "Lack of input sanitization before copying user-provided data into a fixed-size paged pool memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can elevate privileges to SYSTEM level, allowing arbitrary code execution with the highest privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted IOCTL requests with excessively long Unicode file paths to the vulnerable kernel driver.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver."
