Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8837:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `isofs_real_readdir` function of fuseiso. This function is responsible for reading directory entries from ISO filesystem images. The vulnerability stems from the way the code constructs absolute pathnames. It copies the current path into a buffer named `absolute_entry` and then concatenates the entry name using `strcat`. If the combined length of the path and the entry exceeds `PATH_MAX`, a buffer overflow occurs because the buffer is allocated on the stack, with fixed size `PATH_MAX`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of a fixed-size stack buffer and `strcat` to build file paths, without proper bounds checking.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The code does not validate or sanitize the input, allowing a specially crafted ISO image to force the creation of overly long absolute paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause a crash of the fuseiso process due to memory corruption.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While modern systems like Fedora have stack protection mechanisms (FORTIFY_SOURCE) that mitigate arbitrary code execution, the vulnerability could still be potentially exploited to execute arbitrary code if those protections are absent.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted ISO images:** An attacker can create a malicious ISO file with deeply nested directory structures or extremely long filenames, designed to trigger the buffer overflow when opened using fuseiso.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to mount the malicious ISO image using fuseiso. This could be achieved through social engineering or by distributing the malicious ISO via websites or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create ISO images:** The attacker needs to be able to create an ISO image with specific properties, such as long directory paths.
- **Ability to entice a user:** The attacker needs to convince the user to mount the malicious ISO image with fuseiso. This can be done through various social engineering tactics.
- **No special privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a normal user.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
- Red Hat and Debian acknowledge that `FORTIFY_SOURCE` mitigates but does not fully eliminate the risk of code execution.
- Patches involve checking if `PATH_MAX` is exceeded during construction of absolute paths and bailing out if true to prevent overflow
- The vulnerability was present in older versions of fuseiso, specifically prior to version 20070708-r3 in Gentoo, 20070708-3+deb7u1 in Debian Wheezy and 20070708-3.2 in Debian Sid.
- The provided bug reports from Red Hat include a test ISO image (`deep-tree.iso.gz`) that can reproduce this vulnerability.

The information from Gentoo's security advisory (GLSA 202007-20) confirms that the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
