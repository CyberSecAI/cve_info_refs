{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is located in the TextField.tabIndex setter within Adobe Flash Player. When the parameter provided to this setter is an object containing a `valueOf` function, that function can trigger the freeing of the TextField's parent, leading to a use-after-free if the parent is accessed afterwards.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Flash Player process. This could allow attackers to gain control of the affected system, steal data, or cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious SWF file which uses the vulnerable TextField.tabIndex setter with a malicious object.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to deliver a crafted SWF file to a user and convince them to open it using a vulnerable version of Flash Player. This could be achieved via malicious websites or by distributing the file through other means such as email."
