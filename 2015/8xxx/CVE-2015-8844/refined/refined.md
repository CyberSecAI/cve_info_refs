Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2015-8844:

**1. Vulnerability Description**
*   **Root Cause**: The vulnerability stems from incorrect restoration of machine-specific registers (MSRs) related to transactional memory on PowerPC (PPC) architecture within the Linux kernel when returning from a signal handler.
*  **Weaknesses**:  The kernel failed to properly validate or sanitize the transactional memory state registers being restored from user space. Specifically, both the 'T' and 'S' bits within the MSR should not be set simultaneously by user space. The kernel was not verifying this condition.
*   **Impact**: This improper restoration could cause the kernel to enter an inconsistent state leading to:
    *   A kernel panic (system crash), resulting in a denial of service.
    *   Unpredictable behavior by changing the call path on return from userspace which could potentially lead to exploitable conditions.
*   **Attack vectors**: Exploitation can be achieved locally by crafting a signal handler that manipulates the transactional memory state registers in a specific manner.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the vulnerable system.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send a signal to a process and set up a specific signal handler.

**2. Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the PowerPC platform, and could affect both big-endian and little-endian systems.
*   The issue manifests when returning from user space to the kernel via the `rfid` (return from interrupt doubleword) instruction.
*   The inconsistent MSR state is related to the Transactional Memory (TM) functionality which has been added to recent PowerPC hardware.
*   The `BUG()` function, within the `arch/powerpc/kernel/tm.S` file, is triggered due to the unexpected state when `tm_reclaim_current` is called which leads to a kernel panic.
* The issue also exists on QEMU guests running on PPC.
* The provided fixes block setting of the illegal combination of flags `T` and `S` by user space.

**3. Affected Systems**
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2 real-time kernels are affected.
*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected.

**4. Resolution**
* The vulnerability was addressed by applying two specific commits to the Linux kernel:
    *   `d2b9d2a5ad5ef04ff978c9923d19730cb05efd55`: Blocks signal return setting invalid MSR state
    *   `7f821fc9c77a9b01fe7b1d6e72717b33d8d64142`: Checks for already reclaimed tasks.
* These fixes are included in Red Hat Security Advisories:
    *   RHSA-2016:2574
    *   RHSA-2016:2584
* These errata update the `kernel` and `kernel-rt` packages respectively.

**5. Additional Details**

*  The fixes ensure that the transactional memory state is correctly initiated for the handler to work.
* The issue was discovered by Miroslav Vadkerti.
*  The bug report also references the oss-sec mailing list post where the issue was first disclosed.

In summary, CVE-2015-8844 is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to improper MSR restoration in signal handlers on PPC, leading to a kernel panic. The fix involves checking for an invalid MSR state before loading the user-provided values. The relevant patches and advisories are detailed in the provided content.
