Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `_IO_wstr_overflow` function within the GNU C Library (glibc). This function is responsible for reallocating a buffer when writing to a wide-character string stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The `_IO_wstr_overflow` function calculates a new buffer size with `new_size = 2 * old_wblen + 100;`. If `old_wblen` is large enough, the multiplication can result in an integer overflow, causing `new_size` to wrap around to a small value.
- **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** After calculating the (incorrect) `new_size`, the code multiplies this by `sizeof(wchar_t)` to determine the size in bytes. If the multiplication itself does not overflow, it uses the wrapped-around `new_size` value. Subsequently, the function allocates a new buffer based on the undersized calculation, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow when the data is copied from the old buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application using the vulnerable `_IO_wstr_overflow` function.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the overflow is carefully crafted, it could overwrite adjacent heap metadata or other critical data, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses a wide-character stream (e.g., opened with `open_wmemstream`) and writes enough data to cause the internal buffer to reallocate.
- The attacker needs to provide a large enough input such that `old_wblen` will cause the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input stream being written to the wide-character stream to cause the buffer reallocation.
- The attacker would be operating with the privileges of the application using the wide stream operations that are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported in glibc version 2.19 and fixed in version 2.22, and was backported to older glibc release branches.
- The bug report mentions that "At the doubling before the one resulting in the overflow you'd have buffers of (nearly) 1/4 and 1/2 of the address space or more allocated simultaneously, so it needs to be possible to allocate 3/4 of the address space in those two contiguous regions in order to get to the point where the overflow occurs."
- The fix involves preventing the integer overflow when calculating the new buffer size.
- The bug report mentions a potential for exploitation on 64 bit systems, given that a large contiguous memory allocation is possible.
