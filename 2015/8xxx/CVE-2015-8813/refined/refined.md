Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8813:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly discusses CVE-2015-8813 and its root cause, particularly focusing on the SSRF vulnerability in the `feedproxy.aspx` component of the Umbraco CMS.
   - The content includes email correspondence explicitly assigning the CVE ID to the described vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an insufficiently restricted URL parameter within the `feedproxy.aspx` file. This file is designed to fetch external resources based on a URL provided in the GET parameter.
   - The vulnerability arises because the application did not properly validate and restrict the destination of the fetched URL, allowing an attacker to supply a URL pointing to internal resources, including the localhost.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. The `feedproxy.aspx` page fetches content from a URL provided by the user, without proper sanitization or restriction.
    - **Lack of Port Restriction:**  The initial vulnerability allowed access to any port on the localhost (e.g., 127.0.0.1:25 or 127.0.0.1:8080), enabling attackers to perform port scanning of the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Internal Resource Access:** Attackers could access internal services or applications running on the server by manipulating the URL parameter to point to localhost and specific ports.
   - **Port Scanning:** The SSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to probe open ports on the server. This information could then be used for further attacks targeting services running on those ports.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Error messages from the `feedproxy.aspx` page can indicate whether a specific port is open or closed on the server, leaking potentially sensitive network information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **HTTP GET Parameter:** The primary attack vector is the `url` GET parameter of the `feedproxy.aspx` file.
    - Attackers manipulate this parameter to point to internal resources or arbitrary IP addresses and ports.
    - Example: `<http://local/Umbraco/feedproxy.aspx?url=http://127.0.0.1:25/index>`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the Umbraco server where `feedproxy.aspx` is available.
   - **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests with the malicious URL within the `url` parameter.
   - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability in `feedproxy.aspx` did not appear to require prior authentication.

**7. Patch/Mitigation Details:**
    - The vulnerability was addressed by adding the constraint `&& requestUri.Port == 80` to the code. This change restricts the accepted ports to 80, preventing the SSRF attack on other ports.
    - The fix can be found in this commit: <https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/commit/924a016ffe7ae7ea6d516c07a7852f0095eddbce>
    - The vulnerable code resides in the file `src/Umbraco.Web/umbraco.presentation/umbraco/dashboard/FeedProxy.aspx.cs`.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content clarifies that CVE-2015-8813 is different from CVE-2012-1301. CVE-2012-1301 dealt with Umbraco acting like an open proxy, while CVE-2015-8813 relates specifically to SSRF leading to potential port scanning.
