Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the LXDM (Lightweight X Display Manager) before version 0.5.2 did not start the X server with the `-auth` parameter. This parameter is essential for restricting connections to the X server based on authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of X server authentication. Without the `-auth` parameter, any local user can connect to the X server without proper authorization.
*   **Exposed X Server:** The X server is exposed to connections from any local user on the system.
*   **Session Persistence (Potential, but not the CVE focus):**  While not the primary focus of this CVE, the discussion mentions that LXDM defaults to not restarting the X server between sessions. Additionally, it doesn't change authentication cookies or remove xhost authorizations which could allow a local user to connect to an X server after a user has logged out. This could also be problematic. This behavior is controlled by a `reset` option in `lxdm.conf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Any local user can connect to the X server. This access can allow unauthorized users to:
    *   Monitor the current user's activities by observing their graphical display.
    *   Potentially inject input and manipulate the user's session.
    *   Gain access to resources handled by the X server.
    *   Bypass restrictions designed to isolate user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the machine. An attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable LXDM version is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to connect to the X server which typically means they are a local user on the same machine

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed in LXDM version 0.5.2 and later by adding the `-auth` parameter when starting the X server.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates the issue was already fixed in all Fedora versions through a related bug fix ([bug 1268900](show_bug.cgi?id=1268900)).
