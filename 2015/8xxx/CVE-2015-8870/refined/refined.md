Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `bmp2tiff` command-line tool within the LibTIFF library.
*   The tool calculates the size of the uncompressed image buffer by multiplying the image width and length. There's no check to prevent integer overflows during this multiplication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of width and length values can result in an integer overflow, leading to a small `uncompr_size` calculation.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  Although the allocated `uncomprbuf` is smaller than required, the program uses the original (potentially large) width and length values for accessing and writing to the buffer later. This leads to writing outside the allocated buffer boundaries, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-based buffer over-read can lead to a crash of the `bmp2tiff` tool.
*   **Possible Information Disclosure:** The overflow could potentially allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory regions from the process and write them to the output file, leading to possible sensitive information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A specially crafted BMP file with manipulated width and length fields in the header is processed by the vulnerable `bmp2tiff` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a crafted BMP file to a user or system using the vulnerable `bmp2tiff` tool.
*  No specific attacker capabilities/position are mentioned beyond having access to provide input to the vulnerable tool.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is found in LibTIFF versions before 4.0.4.
*   The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing using AFL (American Fuzzy Lop).
*   The fix involves adding a check for integer overflows during the `uncompr_size` calculation.
*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable. It is noted that the vulnerability is primarily limited to reading more or less arbitrary memory regions and writing them to an output file. It was considered unlikely that this could be used in a realistic attack scenario.
*  A Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2017:0225) addressed this and other libtiff vulnerabilities.
