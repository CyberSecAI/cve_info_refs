  "CVE-2015-8782": {
    "description": "tif_luv.c in libtiff allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds writes) via a crafted TIFF image, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8781.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in tif_luv.c when processing a crafted TIFF image with an invalid number of samples per pixel in LogL compressed data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF image",
	  "Network",
       "Local"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User interaction (opening a crafted TIFF image)",
	"additional_details":"The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of sample data within the `tif_luv.c` file, particularly within the `LogL` decompression functionality. When processing an image with a specific sample per pixel configuration, an out-of-bounds write occurs.  Attackers can exploit this flaw by providing specially crafted TIFF images with an invalid sample per pixel configuration, leading to a denial-of-service situation or possibly code execution with user privileges. This vulnerability may be triggered through various attack vectors, including user-initiated interaction (such as opening an image) or via network-based attacks on vulnerable services."

	 "additional_details":"The vulnerability resides in the `tif_luv.c` file of libtiff, specifically when processing LogL compressed TIFF images. When the number of samples per pixel in a specially crafted image does not correspond to expectations, an out-of-bounds write can occur, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability can be exploited through various attack vectors, such as social engineering via email, web browsers, or network-based attacks against vulnerable services. Successful exploitation requires the victim or an application processing this image."
