Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-8834:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in an HTML file (`example.html`) included in the Genericons icon font package. This package was shipped with the Twenty Fifteen theme and a number of popular plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `example.html` file in the Genericons package contained a flaw that could be exploited to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser when they accessed the file or a page that loaded content from the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of Sites:** Attackers could use this XSS vulnerability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Redirecting users** to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement** of the website.
    *   **Data theft:** accessing sensitive information.
    *   **Malware distribution** to site visitors.
    *   Full site compromise
    *   Privilege escalation if admin is targeted

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct access to the vulnerable HTML file:** An attacker could directly target the vulnerable `example.html` file if it was accessible on the server
*   **Indirect injection through vulnerable plugins/themes:** If the site uses themes or plugins that include the vulnerable `example.html` file and these themes/plugins are not updated, this could also be used to inject malicious scripts

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Skills:** Attackers need a basic understanding of how to craft malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Accessibility to vulnerable resource**: The attacker would need to find a website running a vulnerable version of WordPress, themes, or plugin that includes the vulnerable file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **WordPress 4.2.2 Fix:** WordPress 4.2.2 was released specifically to address this vulnerability. The fix included:
    *   Removing the vulnerable `example.html` file from the Twenty Fifteen theme and other affected themes/plugins hosted on WordPress.org.
    *   Proactively scanning the `wp-content` directory for the vulnerable `example.html` file and removing it during the upgrade process.
*   **Manual Updates/VCS Checkouts:**  The advisory notes that manual installations and those using VCS checkout (like SVN) will not remove this file, requiring manual removal of the file.
*   **Multiple Reports:** The vulnerability was reported by Robert Abela of Netsparker.
* **Debian Security Advisory:** Debian issued DSA-3639-1 to address this along with other vulnerabilities in WordPress.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8834 is a critical cross-site scripting vulnerability in an HTML file bundled with the Genericons icon font package. WordPress 4.2.2 was released as a security fix, removing the vulnerable file and hardening against related issues. The impact of this vulnerability is high, potentially leading to site compromise via malicious script injection.
