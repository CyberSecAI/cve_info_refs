- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation issues
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows attackers to conduct reflected cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Through input validation vulnerabilities in ColdFusion
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to inject malicious scripts through the input fields of the ColdFusion application.
