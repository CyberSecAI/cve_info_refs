      "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in Qualcomm components could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device.",
        "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the Qualcomm bootloader allows for arbitrary code execution in the kernel context.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper access control within the Qualcomm bootloader",
            "Missing security checks when handling specific data"
        ],
        "impact": "Local privilege escalation leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context. This could result in a complete compromise of the device, potentially requiring a re-flash to recover.",
        "attack_vector": "Local malicious application.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device, which can exploit this vulnerability to escalate to kernel privileges."
