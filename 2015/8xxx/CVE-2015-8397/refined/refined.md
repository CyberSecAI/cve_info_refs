  "CVE-2015-8397": {
    "description": "The vulnerability occurs during the decoding of JPEG-LS images when the dimensions of the embedded JPEG-LS image (as specified in the JPEG headers) are smaller than the ones of the selected region (set by gdcm::ImageRegionReader::SetRegion and usually based on DICOM header values).",
    "root_cause": "Missing checks in GDCM when decoding JPEG-LS images.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leak parts of an application's memory or cause an application to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted DICOM file containing a JPEG-LS image where the dimensions specified in the JPEG headers are smaller than the selected region set by the application.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted DICOM file to an application that uses the vulnerable GDCM library to process it."
