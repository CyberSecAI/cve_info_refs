## [Heap overflow and endless loop in exfatfsck / exfat-utils](/25-Heap-overflow-and-endless-loop-in-exfatfsck-exfat-utils.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Saturday, October 24. 2015

exfat-utils is a collection of tools to work with the exFAT filesystem. Fuzzing the exfatfsck with american fuzzy lop led to the discovery of a write heap overflow and an endless loop.

Especially at risk are systems that are configured to run filesystem checks automatically on external devices like USB flash drives.

A malformed input can cause a write heap overflow in the function verify\_vbr\_checksum. It might be possible to use this for code execution.

Another malformed input can cause an endless loop, leading to a possible denial of service.

Both issues have been fixed in the [latest release 1.2.1 of exfat-utils](https://github.com/relan/exfat/releases/tag/v1.2.1).

# exFAT: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-31**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in exFAT allowing remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-fs/exfat-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |

| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.1** |

### Background

A full-featured exFAT file system implementation for Unix-like systems.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities were found in exFAT. A malformed input can cause a
write heap overflow or cause an endless loop.

### Impact

Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code or cause Denial of
Service.

### Workaround

## Description

[![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)](/hannob)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Sep 9, 2015](https://github.com/relan/exfat/issues/5#issue-105554703)

This input file can trigger a heap overflow in exfatfsck:

<https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum>

This was found while fuzzing with the tool american fuzzy lop.

Here is the stack trace from address sanitizer:

Use CVE-2015-8026 for the "AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ...
WRITE of size 110" report for the
exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum file. If anyone
wants to show that another part of the
2e86ae5f81da11f11673d0546efb525af02b7786 commit fixed a different
vulnerability that wasn't reported in the
25-Heap-overflow-and-endless-loop-in-exfatfsck-exfat-utils.html post,
then a second CVE ID may be available.

> Another malformed input can cause an endless loop, leading to a
> possible denial of service.

> Especially at risk are systems that are configured to run filesystem
> checks automatically on external devices like USB flash drives.

>> Detect infinite loop in rootdir_size().
>>
>> Otherwise malformed FS can cause hang on mount.

We don't feel that this endless-loop issue should necessarily have a
CVE ID. There may be some environments in which the attacker can cross
a privilege boundary by inserting a flash drive to trigger CPU
consumption and/or inability to complete the boot process. Often,
shutting off the computer would be an equally effective DoS.

## [Heap overflow and endless loop in exfatfsck / exfat-utils](/25-Heap-overflow-and-endless-loop-in-exfatfsck-exfat-utils.html)

Posted by [Hanno Böck](https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/authors/1-Hanno-Boeck) on Saturday, October 24. 2015

exfat-utils is a collection of tools to work with the exFAT filesystem. Fuzzing the exfatfsck with american fuzzy lop led to the discovery of a write heap overflow and an endless loop.

Especially at risk are systems that are configured to run filesystem checks automatically on external devices like USB flash drives.

A malformed input can cause a write heap overflow in the function verify\_vbr\_checksum. It might be possible to use this for code execution.

[Upstream bug report](https://github.com/relan/exfat/issues/5)

[Sample file triggering the bug](https://crashes.fuzzing-project.org/exfatfsck-heap-overflow-write-verify_vbr_checksum)

[Git commit for fix](https://github.com/relan/exfat/commit/2e86ae5f81da11f11673d0546efb525af02b7786)

[CVE-2015-8026](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8026)

Another malformed input can cause an endless loop, leading to a possible denial of service.

[Git commit of fix](https://github.com/relan/exfat/commit/35a1f77f9be2d8b21731f758baba4334935bf18b)

Both issues have been fixed in the [latest release 1.2.1 of exfat-utils](https://github.com/relan/exfat/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
