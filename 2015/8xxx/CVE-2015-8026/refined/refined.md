Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A malformed exFAT filesystem image can cause a heap buffer overflow in the `verify_vbr_checksum` function within the `exfatfsck` tool. This occurs due to insufficient validation of sector and cluster sizes, leading to memory corruption when the tool attempts to read or write data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `verify_vbr_checksum` function. This is caused by writing data past the allocated buffer.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate sector and cluster sizes before using them, which allows for the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap overflow can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the main focus of CVE-2015-8026, a related issue was an endless loop condition in rootdir_size(), which also leads to DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed exFAT Image:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted exFAT filesystem image to the `exfatfsck` tool. This could be done by inserting a USB drive with the malformed file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious exFAT filesystem image to a system running the vulnerable `exfat-utils` software. This can be achieved by either having physical access or tricking a user to use a malformed USB device.
- The attacker does not need to be local to the system, if the system automatically checks the attached storage device, and it can be connected remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.1 of exfat-utils.
- The fix involved adding checks for sector and cluster size before use, preventing heap corruption.
- The commit `2e86ae5f81da11f11673d0546efb525af02b7786` addresses this vulnerability by adding checks on sector and cluster sizes.
