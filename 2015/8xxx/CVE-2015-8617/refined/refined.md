Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8617:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2015-8617 in the description of bug #71105 on bugs.php.net. The commit message on GitHub, also present in the content, confirms that the vulnerability was addressed by that commit.  The vulnerability is described as a "Format String Vulnerability in Class Name Error Message". Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a format string vulnerability in the way PHP 7.0.0 handles non-existent class names. Specifically, when an attempt is made to call a method on a non-existent class, the class name was passed directly into a `zend_vspprintf` function as a format string, without proper sanitization.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the use of user-controlled input (class name) as a format string argument to a print function. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%n`, `%d`) which can lead to various vulnerabilities.
-   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code did not sanitize the class name input, allowing format specifiers to be processed by the print function.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The exploitability of the format string vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. As seen in the test script provided, by manipulating the class name, an attacker can write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The simple test script provided shows the ability to cause a segmentation fault by injecting a malicious format string. This can be used for a denial-of-service attack.
-   **Information Leakage:** Format specifiers like `%s` can leak information from the server's memory.
-   **Memory Corruption:** Injection of format specifiers like %n can lead to arbitrary memory writes, potentially leading to corrupted data and further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Direct Method Call to Non-Existent Class:** The vulnerability is triggered by attempting to call a method on a class that does not exist, using `Class::doSomething()` syntax.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Code Execution:** An attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable code.
-  **Control over class name:** An attacker must be able to control a class name string which is passed to vulnerable code.

**Additional Information**

- The fix was implemented by adding '%s' as a second parameter for the `zend_throw_error` function, effectively preventing the format string vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is specific to PHP 7.0.0 and was not present in previous versions.
- This vulnerability is classified as a security bug by PHP developers.
- The PHP code snippet provided in the bug report clearly demonstrates the vulnerability.
