Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8004:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the revision deletion process of MediaWiki. Specifically, when modifying the revision deletion settings of a suppressed revision, the system only checked the suppression status of the *first* revision in a request, not all revisions included in the modification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check (CWE-862):** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization when handling revision deletion settings. The system failed to verify if the user modifying the suppression settings had the required 'suppressrevision' user right for all revisions being changed, relying only on a check of the first revision in a request.
*   **Incorrect Logic:**  The code logic incorrectly assumed that if a user had the 'viewsuppressed' right (allowing them to view suppressed content) but lacked the 'suppressrevision' right, they would be blocked from modifying suppression settings. However, this was only checked for the *first* revision processed and not all revisions in the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Suppressed Revisions:** Users with the 'viewsuppressed' right, but not the 'suppressrevision' right, could remove suppression from revisions they were not authorized to modify.
*   **Information Exposure:** This could lead to the exposure of previously hidden information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation of URL Parameters:**  An attacker would need to construct a URL to the `action=revisiondelete` endpoint that included a suppressed revision and any non-suppressed revision.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker would then submit the form, triggering the incorrect authorization check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MediaWiki User Account:** The attacker would require a user account with the 'viewsuppressed' user right on the affected MediaWiki instance.
*   **No 'suppressrevision' right:** The attacker should *not* have the 'suppressrevision' right.
*   **Knowledge of Suppressed Revisions:** They need to know of the existence and IDs of suppressed revisions they wish to unsuppress.
*   **Ability to Construct a URL with Multiple Revisions:** The attacker must construct a specific URL including a suppressed revision and a non-suppressed one and manipulate the form.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected MediaWiki versions 1.24.0 to 1.25.2.
*   The fix involves checking the user's 'suppressrevision' right for *all* revisions included in a revision deletion modification, not just the first one.
*   The provided information includes a patch to fix the issue.
*   This issue was initially considered low-risk due to the limited number of users with the 'viewsuppressed' right but not the 'suppressrevision' right on Wikimedia wikis, but was fixed anyway, for example for potential future expansion of rights.
