Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8928:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `process_add_entry` function within `archive_read_support_format_mtree.c` in libarchive. The function is responsible for processing entries within mtree files. Specifically the function scans a string from end to start to identify the filename, if the entire line is the filename the logic scans out of bound before the start of the string causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This occurs during the parsing of mtree files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition. A remote attacker could use a malformed mtree file to crash a program that used a vulnerable libarchive library.
- Possible information disclosure: By carefully crafting the mtree file, an attacker might be able to read a small amount of memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted mtree file: A malformed mtree file acts as the attack vector. When a vulnerable libarchive library processes this specially-crafted file, it triggers the out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted mtree file.
- The attacker must rely on a program which uses a vulnerable version of libarchive.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as having a moderate severity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in libarchive version 3.2.0 and later.
- The `readline` function is also mentioned as the source of the vulnerability in the SUSE description.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
