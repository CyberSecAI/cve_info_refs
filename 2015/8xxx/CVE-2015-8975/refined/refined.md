Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8975:

**CVE-2015-8975**: Low Risk: Possible XSS Injection in the error handler

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The error handler in MyBB was susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection. The specific mechanism is not detailed in the provided context.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerability, where malicious scripts can be injected into the error handler.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when a particular error is triggered. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions, depending on the attacker's payload.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious code through a method that results in an error being triggered that leads to the XSS vulnerability in the error handler. The specific method is not detailed, but it is clear the error handler can be manipulated for an XSS attack.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code or trigger a specific error in MyBB in order to activate the XSS vulnerability. The details are not specific enough to determine if user-level or admin-level capabilities are needed.
