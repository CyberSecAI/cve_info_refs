  "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.268 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.554 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.204, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204 allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8045, CVE-2015-8047, CVE-2015-8060, CVE-2015-8408, CVE-2015-8416, CVE-2015-8417, CVE-2015-8418, CVE-2015-8419, CVE-2015-8443, CVE-2015-8444, and CVE-2015-8451.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Unspecified vectors leading to memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
     "attackVectors": [
      "Unspecified vectors"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted SWF file which triggers the vulnerability on a vulnerable Flash Player version.",
   "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is related to memory corruption. It affects multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The vulnerability is triggered by unspecified vectors which suggests that the attack vector is not directly exploitable through direct interaction, but likely through malformed Flash content loaded into the Flash Player. The vulnerability is distinct from other vulnerabilities with similar causes, indicated by the references to different CVE IDs, this suggests other exploitable vulnerabilities are present in Flash Player relating to memory corruption. The provided information does not specify the exact mechanism through which the memory corruption occurs, and no specific code analysis is provided."
