{
  "CVE-2015-8242": {
    "Description": "The xmlSAX2TextNode function in SAX2.c in the push interface in the HTML parser in libxml2 before 2.9.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer over-read and application crash) or obtain sensitive information via crafted XML data.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer over-read occurs in the xmlSAX2TextNode function due to incorrect handling of text nodes in push mode during HTML parsing.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash) or sensitive information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted XML data processed by libxml2's HTML parser in push mode.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide crafted XML data to an application using the vulnerable libxml2 library. The attacker has to control the input to cause the overflow.",
    "Additional Information": "Some sources also mention that the out-of-bounds read can result in a crash or a disclosure of sensitive information."
