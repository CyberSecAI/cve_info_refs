  "CVE_ID": "CVE-2015-8790",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking in the `EbmlUnicodeString::UpdateFromUTF8` function when parsing UTF-8 encoded strings. Specifically, the code calculates the length of a UTF-8 character based on the leading byte. If the indicated length exceeds the remaining bytes in the buffer, the parser attempts to read beyond the buffer's boundaries, leading to an out-of-bounds read on the heap.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Heap information leak"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the process's heap memory by providing a specially crafted UTF-8 string. This is due to the out-of-bounds read, which could expose contents from adjacent memory regions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted UTF-8 string within an EBML document"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted EBML document containing a maliciously crafted UTF-8 string, which is then parsed by the vulnerable function `EbmlUnicodeString::UpdateFromUTF8`. This requires that the application is processing user supplied EBML content. "
