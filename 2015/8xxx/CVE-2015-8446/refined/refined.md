  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.268 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.554 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.204, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via an MP3 file with COMM tags that are mishandled during memory allocation, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8438.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow due to mishandling of COMM tags in MP3 files during memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system.",
    "attackVector": "The attack vector involves an MP3 file with specially crafted COMM tags.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to open a malicious webpage or file containing a crafted MP3 file."
  },
    "affectedProducts":[
        "Adobe Flash Player (Windows, macOS, Linux)",
        "Adobe AIR",
        "Adobe AIR SDK",

    ],
  "patch": [
    "Adobe Flash Player versions 18.0.0.268 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X are affected.",
    "Adobe Flash Player before 11.2.202.554 on Linux is affected.",

      "Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204 is affected.",
       "Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204 is affected."
   ],
  "additionalNotes": "This vulnerability is different from CVE-2015-8438 and requires user interaction to be exploited. The issue lies in the failure to allocate enough space for COMM tags when processing MP3 files.  An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process."
