    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the TextField object implementation in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.268 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.228 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.554 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.204, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.204, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.204 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted autoSize property value.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the TextField object when handling the autoSize property.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious SWF file that manipulates the autoSize property of a TextField object. The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.",
