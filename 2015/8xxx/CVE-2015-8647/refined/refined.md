  "CVE-2015-8647": {
    "Description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.324 and 19.x and 20.x before 20.0.0.267 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.559 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 20.0.0.233, Adobe AIR SDK before 20.0.0.233, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 20.0.0.233 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8634, CVE-2015-8635, CVE-2015-8638, CVE-2015-8639, CVE-2015-8640, CVE-2015-8641, CVE-2015-8642, CVE-2015-8643, CVE-2015-8646, CVE-2015-8648, CVE-2015-8649, and CVE-2015-8650.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition when handling a MovieClip object. Specifically, when the 'attachMovie' method of a MovieClip object is called, a dangling pointer can be created and then reused after the memory it points to has been freed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious Flash file (SWF) that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability. The attacker must also trick the user into visiting a malicious web page or opening the malicious file."
