### Bug Description

This code dumps the connection\_info dict into the StorageError message:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L85-L87>

As can be seen a few lines later, auth\_password can be in that dict:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L96>

So the password would be leaked into the error message that's raised up. This could eventually get back to the logs or a user if not handled properly.

xen: mask passwords in volume connection\_data dict

The connection\_data dict can have credentials in it, so we need to scrub

    those before putting the stringified dict into the StorageError message

    and raising that up and when logging the dict.

Note that strutils.mask\_password converts the dict to a string using

    six.text\_type so we don't have to do that conversion first.

Does this seem like a reasonable / correct impact description for this:

Title: Potential Xen connection password leak via StorageError

Reporter: Matt Riedemann (IBM)

Products: Nova

Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

Description:

Mat Riedemann from IBM reported a information disclosure vulnerability

in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to connect a volume

using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be logged. These

parameters may include credentials which are not masked. An attacker

with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials with the

Xen API directly. Only Nova setups using the Xen backend are affected

by this flaw.

This is looking good to me Tony, thanks!

Though, the title could be a bit less dramatic if it also mentions "leak in log".

Per:

Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

That's Juno, Kilo and Liberty, respectively. Since Icehouse was EOL at the time that I was checking this, I didn't include that in the bug report, but if it is affected do we need to list it (and previous versions)? If needed I can figure that out, I'll have to do it internally anyway since we still support going back to Grizzly. But if it's not something you'd put in that impact statement, nevermind.

Oh well, if the oldest version affected is not easily identified, we can leave it open-ended: like this:

Else, the impact description proposed in comment #15 LGTM. Thanks Grant\*

Add security fixes to the release notes for 12.0.1

There are two security fixes in the upcoming stable/liberty

    point release (12.0.1) so we should document those in the

    release notes.

This shouldn't be merged until I11485f077d28f4e97529a691e55e3e3c0bea8872

    is merged. We don't use Depends-On here since we don't want to hold this

    up on the stable/kilo backport of that change.

# RFE: block\_device\_info dict should have a password key rather than clear password

Bug #1321785 reported by

on 2014-05-21

### Bug Description

See [bug 1319943](/bugs/1319943) and the related patch <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/93787/> for details, but right now the block\_device\_info dict passed around in the nova virt driver can contain a clear text password for the auth\_password key.

That bug and patch are masking the password when logged in the immediate known locations, but this could continue to crop up so we should change the design such that the block\_device\_info dict doesn't contain the password but rather a key to a store that nova can retrieve the password for use.

Comment from Daniel Berrange in the patch above:

"Long term I think we need to figure out a way to remove the passwords from any data dicts we pass around. Ideally the block device info would merely contain something like a UUID to identify a password, which Nova could use to fetch the actual password from a secure password manager service at time of use. Thus we wouldn't have to worry about random objects/dicts containing actual passwords. Obviously this isn't something we can do now, but could you file an RFE to address this from a design POV, because masking passwords at time of logging call is not really a viable long term strategy IMHO."

Ideally we'd turn connection\_info into a nova object and it would have a \_\_repr\_\_ method that would mask the values by default. Then we could use the ConnectionInfo object in the BlockDeviceMapping object and we wouldn't have to worry about this when things get logged.

The ovo change merely added a new SensitiveString field type. We still have to actually convert Nova to use that new field type where needed

Use SensitiveStringField for BlockDeviceMapping.connection\_info

bd977f400a1192d5cf7c2b52ef91615c0828813c added the SensitiveStringField

    to oslo.versionedobjects. SensitiveStringField is a StringField, which

    is what BlockDeviceMapping.connection\_info was already using. The difference

    is that a SensitiveStringField masks passwords in the 'stringify' method,

    which is what's used when \_\_repr\_\_ is called on the object.

Since BDM.connection\_info can contain credentials, and the connection\_info

    dict gets passed around quite a bit in the compute manager and virt drivers,

    it has from time to time gotten logged without first masking passwords.

This makes the object handle masking the password so we don't have to do it

    explicitly anymore.

There is no version bump on the BlockDeviceMapping object since nothing has

    functionally changed.

Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Nova

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError
Reporter: Matt Riedemann (IBM)
Products: Nova
Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

Description:
Matt Riedemann from IBM reported an information disclosure vulnerability
in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to connect a volume
using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be logged. These
parameters may include credentials that are not masked. An attacker
with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials with the
Xen API directly. Only Nova deployments using the Xen backend are
affected by this flaw.

### Bug Description

This code dumps the connection\_info dict into the StorageError message:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L85-L87>

As can be seen a few lines later, auth\_password can be in that dict:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L96>

So the password would be leaked into the error message that's raised up. This could eventually get back to the logs or a user if not handled properly.

xen: mask passwords in volume connection\_data dict

The connection\_data dict can have credentials in it, so we need to scrub

    those before putting the stringified dict into the StorageError message

    and raising that up and when logging the dict.

Note that strutils.mask\_password converts the dict to a string using

    six.text\_type so we don't have to do that conversion first.

This is looking good to me Tony, thanks!

Though, the title could be a bit less dramatic if it also mentions "leak in log".

Per:

Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

That's Juno, Kilo and Liberty, respectively. Since Icehouse was EOL at the time that I was checking this, I didn't include that in the bug report, but if it is affected do we need to list it (and previous versions)? If needed I can figure that out, I'll have to do it internally anyway since we still support going back to Grizzly. But if it's not something you'd put in that impact statement, nevermind.

Oh well, if the oldest version affected is not easily identified, we can leave it open-ended: like this:

Affects: <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

Else, the impact description proposed in comment #15 LGTM. Thanks Grant\*

Add security fixes to the release notes for 12.0.1

There are two security fixes in the upcoming stable/liberty

    point release (12.0.1) so we should document those in the

    release notes.

This shouldn't be merged until I11485f077d28f4e97529a691e55e3e3c0bea8872

    is merged. We don't use Depends-On here since we don't want to hold this

    up on the stable/kilo backport of that change.

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L85-L87>

As can be seen a few lines later, auth\_password can be in that dict:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/12.0.0/nova/virt/xenapi/volume_utils.py#L96>

So the password would be leaked into the error message that's raised up. This could eventually get back to the logs or a user if not handled properly.

Confirmed that the StorageError in the volume\_utils code would get raised up through the attach\_volume method in the virt driver and that would be logged here:

xen: mask passwords in volume connection\_data dict

The connection\_data dict can have credentials in it, so we need to scrub

    those before putting the stringified dict into the StorageError message

    and raising that up and when logging the dict.

Note that strutils.mask\_password converts the dict to a string using

    six.text\_type so we don't have to do that conversion first.

Does this seem like a reasonable / correct impact description for this:

Title: Potential Xen connection password leak via StorageError

Reporter: Matt Riedemann (IBM)

Products: Nova

Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

Description:

Mat Riedemann from IBM reported a information disclosure vulnerability

in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to connect a volume

using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be logged. These

parameters may include credentials which are not masked. An attacker

with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials with the

Xen API directly. Only Nova setups using the Xen backend are affected

by this flaw.

This is looking good to me Tony, thanks!

Though, the title could be a bit less dramatic if it also mentions "leak in log".

Per:

Affects: >= 2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, ==12.0.0

That's Juno, Kilo and Liberty, respectively. Since Icehouse was EOL at the time that I was checking this, I didn't include that in the bug report, but if it is affected do we need to list it (and previous versions)? If needed I can figure that out, I'll have to do it internally anyway since we still support going back to Grizzly. But if it's not something you'd put in that impact statement, nevermind.

Else, the impact description proposed in comment #15 LGTM. Thanks Grant\*

Add security fixes to the release notes for 12.0.1

There are two security fixes in the upcoming stable/liberty

    point release (12.0.1) so we should document those in the

    release notes.

This shouldn't be merged until I11485f077d28f4e97529a691e55e3e3c0bea8872

    is merged. We don't use Depends-On here since we don't want to hold this

    up on the stable/kilo backport of that change.

Add security fixes to the release notes for 12.0.1
There are two security fixes in the upcoming stable/liberty
point release (12.0.1) so we should document those in the
release notes.
This shouldn't be merged until I11485f077d28f4e97529a691e55e3e3c0bea8872
is merged. We don't use Depends-On here since we don't want to hold this
up on the stable/kilo backport of that change.

# OSSA-2016-002: Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError

# OSSA-2016-002: Xen connection password leak in logs via StorageError[Â¶](#ossa-2016-002-xen-connection-password-leak-in-logs-via-storageerror "Link to this heading")

Date:

January 11, 2016

CVE:

CVE-2015-8749

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Nova: >=2014.2 <= 2015.1.2, == 12.0.0

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Matt Riedemann from IBM reported an information disclosure vulnerability in Nova. If a StorageError occurs when attempting to connect a volume using the Xen API, the connection parameters will be logged. These parameters may include credentials that are not masked. An attacker with read access to Nova logs could use these credentials with the Xen API directly. Only Nova deployments using the Xen backend are affected by this flaw.

## Patches[Â¶](#patches "Link to this heading")

* <https://review.openstack.org/249239> (Kilo)
* <https://review.openstack.org/247825> (Liberty)
* <https://review.openstack.org/245987> (Mitaka)

## Credits[Â¶](#credits "Link to this heading")

* Matt Riedemann from IBM (CVE-2015-8749)

## References[Â¶](#references "Link to this heading")

* <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1516765>
* <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8749>

## Notes[Â¶](#notes "Link to this heading")

* This fix will be included in future 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 12.0.1
  (liberty) releases.
