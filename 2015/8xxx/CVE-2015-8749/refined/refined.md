{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `connection_info` dictionary, containing sensitive information like passwords, was being directly included in the `StorageError` message without proper masking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure: Sensitive credentials (e.g., passwords) could be exposed in error messages and logs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to Nova logs could potentially obtain Xen API connection passwords, allowing them to directly interact with the Xen API.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to gain read access to Nova logs to potentially extract the leaked connection passwords.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs read access to the logs generated by the Nova service."
