Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-8779 from the provided content:

**1. From googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.de_414a2502_20250126_015234.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow in the `catopen()` function within glibc. The vulnerability occurs due to a mismatch between a stack buffer (2048 bytes allocated via `alloca()`) and a heap buffer allocated later for a larger DNS response. The stack buffer is used to store the DNS response, leading to a stack overflow if the response exceeds 2048 bytes.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow, incorrect buffer size calculation/handling.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) is possible, although not straightforward due to security mitigations like ASLR. Successful exploitation allows control of EIP/RIP. It may also lead to application crashes.

*   **Attack vectors:** Attacker-controlled domain names, attacker-controlled DNS servers, or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, applications using `getaddrinfo()` such as ssh, sudo, and curl.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to control DNS responses, potentially through a malicious DNS server or by performing a MITM attack to inject a malicious DNS response, or by controlling the domain name used by the client.

*   **Technical information:** glibc allocates 2048 bytes on the stack for a DNS response using `alloca()`. If the response is larger, a new heap buffer is allocated, but under some conditions, the stack buffer is used for storage instead, leading to an overflow.

*   **Mitigation:** Limit the size of DNS responses accepted by the DNS resolver locally and ensure that DNS queries are sent only to DNS servers that limit the response size for UDP responses when the truncation bit is set.

**2. From bugzilla.suse.com_20757916_20250126_015218.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in `hcreate` and `hcreate_r` functions in glibc. This could result in an out-of-bounds memory access if a large size is provided.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to out-of-bound memory access.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Application crashes, potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation via passing a large value to `hcreate` or `hcreate_r`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user with the ability to run an application using vulnerable `hcreate`/`hcreate_r` functions with attacker-controlled arguments.
