Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A bug in JIRA's email notification system caused it to sometimes attach the wrong image to email notifications. Specifically, when a JIRA issue was updated and included a reference to an external image, the email notification could incorrectly attach an image from a completely different, unrelated JIRA issue if that issue had been previously viewed by any user. This happened due to incorrect caching or handling of image attachments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Attachment Handling:** The system was not correctly associating attachments with the specific issues they belonged to when generating email notifications.
*   **Caching or Session Issue:** It appears the issue arose because of an incorrect caching mechanism, where the system incorrectly associated the previously viewed image from issue A with the notification being sent out for issue Y.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact was the potential for unintended disclosure of images. A user could receive an image attached to an email notification that was not intended for them, potentially exposing information from a different project or issue that they might not normally have access to.
*   **Confusion/Misinformation:** Users could be confused or misled by receiving images that were not relevant to the notification.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Email Notifications:** The attack vector was through email notifications generated by JIRA.
*   **Specific Triggering Conditions:** The vulnerability required very specific conditions:
    1. A JIRA issue with a reference to an external image must be updated.
    2. Email notifications must be configured for the updated issue.
    3. An unrelated issue with an attached image must have been viewed by any user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No direct attacker control required:** No direct attacker action was required to trigger this vulnerability. It was triggered by normal user activity and specific configurations.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The only action needed to trigger the vulnerability is a user viewing another issue with an attached image, as well as the activity that generates the email notification for the issue containing the external image link.
*   **Access to JIRA:** The user must have access to JIRA instances and the relevant issues to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was categorized as medium severity by Atlassian.
*   It only affected image attachments (PNG, GIF, JPG). Other file types were not affected.
*   The issue affected JIRA Software, JIRA Core, and JIRA Service Desk.
*   Atlassian Cloud instances were patched promptly, and the vulnerability affected a small percentage of their cloud instances.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in JIRA versions 7.0.4.
*   This bug is tracked in JIRA as JRA-47557, with JRACLOUD-47557 being the corresponding issue in JIRA Cloud.
