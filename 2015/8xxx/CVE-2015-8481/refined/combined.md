**Issue:** JIRA may send emails with incorrect attachments.

**Note:** As of September 2014 we are no longer issuing binary bug patches, Instead we create new maintenance releases for the major versions we are back porting.

**Date of Advisory: 09 Dec 2015**  (UTC)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8481

**Affected Products:**

* JIRA Core
* JIRA Service Desk
* JIRA Software

Affected JIRA product versions:

* 7.0.3 <= version < 7.0.4

### **Summary of Vulnerability**

This advisory discloses a **medium severity** security vulnerability which was introduced in version 7.0.3 of JIRA Software and JIRA Core. Versions of JIRA Software and JIRA Corestarting with 7.0.3 before 7.0.4 are vulnerable. Version 3.0.3 of the bundled JIRA Service Desk installer was packaged with version 7.0.3 of JIRA.

**Atlassian Cloud** instances have **already been upgraded** to a version of JIRA which does **not** have the issue described on this page.

**Customers who have upgraded JIRA to version 7.0.4** **are** **not affected****.**

#### **Customers who have downloaded and installed JIRA 7.0.3 and have not upgraded to 7.0.4**

Please **upgrade** your JIRA installations **immediately** to fix this vulnerability.

### **JIRA may send emails with incorrect image attachments.**

**Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **medium**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

**Description**

A bug introduced in recent versions of JIRA Software, JIRA Service Desk, and JIRA Core may have caused users to receive an image in a JIRA email notification which was not intended for them.

The bug was triggered only under very specific circumstances

1. A JIRA issue containing a field or comment with a reference to an image not stored on the JIRA instance (for example, *<http://www.example.com/image1.gif>)* was updated
2. E-mail notifications were configured for that issue
3. An unrelated JIRA issue containing wiki markup referencing an attached image was viewed by any user
4. Both issues were part of the same JIRA instance (but not necessarily the same project)

Under those circumstances, the notification would have contained the image from the unrelated issue rather than the image from the first issue, regardless of the permission restrictions on the unrelated JIRA issue. Please note that the bug is limited to images, such as icons, screenshots, or file types like PNG, GIF, or JPG. Non-image attachments (i.e. Word documents, Excel files, and PDFs) are NOT affected.For JIRA Service Desk, email notifications with the incorrect image would have only been sent to users with access to the internal view of JIRA Service Desk tickets (i.e. agents). The incorrect image would NOT have been sent to anyone with only the external view of a ticket (i.e. users who have the "customer" or "participant" role).

We became aware of this problem on 4th December 2015.

For Cloud, a fix was rolled out for all Cloud customers within 24 hours of identifying the bug.  The vulnerability existed between Monday November 30th and Saturday, December 5th, 2015. This bug affected only 0.4% of our JIRA Cloud instances.

For Server:

* JIRA Software 7.0.3 and JIRA Core 7.0.3 are affected by this vulnerability.
* JIRA Service Desk 3.0.3, when used with JIRA 7.0.3, is also affected by this vulnerability.

### Summary

When an issue receives an update and an e-mail notification is sent to users about the updates or changes, and the update contains a wiki markup inline reference to an external image. The email sent will be attached with an internal image from another unrelated issue in the JIRA instance instead of the external image.

### Environment

Cloud Environment / JIRA Server 7.0.3

### Steps to Reproduce

* User A views an issue X with an inline wiki markup reference to an image attachment.
* User B comments / updates another issue Y and includes an external image reference via wiki markup.
* An email notification is sent for the change made to Y.
* [BUG] The notification email will display the internal image attached to Issue A instead of the external image.

### Expected Results

Email notifications should not include attachments that have not been referenced in the change to the JIRA issue in question

### Actual Results

Users receive email notifications containing attachments of unrelated issues instead of the one that was meant to be in the notification.

### Notes

More details available at the [security advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2015-12-09)
