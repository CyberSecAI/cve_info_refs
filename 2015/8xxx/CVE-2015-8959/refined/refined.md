Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-8959:

**CVE Description:**

The CVE ID CVE-2015-8959 is assigned to a vulnerability in ImageMagick. The vulnerability is related to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue due to corrupted DDS files, leading to excessive CPU usage.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how ImageMagick handles malformed or corrupted DDS (DirectDraw Surface) image files. Specifically, the issue resides in the `SkipDXTMipmaps` and `SkipRGBMipmaps` functions within the `coders/dds.c` file. The code iterates through mipmaps, seeking bytes based on calculated offsets. However, if the file is corrupted such that `dds_info->mipmapcount`, `w`, or `h` are invalid, the loop may not terminate correctly, leading to excessive calls to `SeekBlob` which causes excessive CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Infinite Loop/Excessive Iteration:** The core issue is a flawed loop within the mipmap processing functions (`SkipDXTMipmaps` and `SkipRGBMipmaps`). The loops' termination condition is not robust enough to handle corrupted DDS files, leading to excessive iterations.
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Due to the excessive iterations and subsequent `SeekBlob` calls, the program consumes a disproportionate amount of CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
-   **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The code fails to adequately validate input values related to mipmap counts, width, and height from the DDS file. This allows a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit can cause the ImageMagick process to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially making the system unresponsive or severely degraded for other tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Maliciously Crafted DDS File:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted DDS image file that contains corrupted or manipulated metadata to trigger the infinite loop.
-   **File Processing:** The attacker would need a way to get ImageMagick to process the crafted DDS file, either directly or indirectly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker must be able to supply the crafted DDS file to the vulnerable system where ImageMagick is used. This might be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means where ImageMagick is utilized to process image files.
-  **No Special Access Required:** The attacker does not need privileged access to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability specifically manifests in the `SkipDXTMipmaps` and `SkipRGBMipmaps` functions located in `coders/dds.c`. The core issue involves a loop that calculates an offset, seeks, and then checks if the `SeekBlob()` call succeeded. If this is not done the loop continues to iterate.
-   **Patches:** The provided github commit links show that the issue was mitigated with the following changes:
     -   Checking the return value of SeekBlob for errors and breaking if needed
     -   Moving the check for end-of-file before calling SeekBlob
     -   Adding a check for a bogus num\_images value to avoid a DOS vulnerability

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8959 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick that can lead to a denial-of-service condition. A maliciously crafted DDS image file can trigger an infinite loop within the DDS decoder, causing the ImageMagick process to consume excessive CPU resources. The issue is rooted in the inadequate input validation and flawed termination conditions of the loops used to process mipmaps.
