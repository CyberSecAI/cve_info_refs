  "CVE-2015-8140": {
    "description": "The ntpq protocol in NTP before 4.2.8p7 allows remote attackers to conduct replay attacks by sniffing the network.",
    "affected_versions": "All ntp-4 releases up to, but not including 4.2.8p6.",
    "root_cause": "The ntpq protocol is vulnerable to replay attacks because the sequence number included in the signature does not prevent replay attacks. Commands not requiring authentication can move the sequence number forward, and NTP does not validate the sequence number.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Replay attack vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could replay intercepted authenticated reconfiguration commands to re-establish an association to a malicious server.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker on the network can intercept authenticated ntpq reconfiguration commands.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to sniff network traffic, specifically authenticated ntpq commands.",
