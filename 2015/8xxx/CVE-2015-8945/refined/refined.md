Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way OpenShift node handles sensitive data. Specifically, private RSA keys and certificates are stored as environment variables within pods. These environment variables are then logged by `openshift-node` into the systemd journal, making them accessible to anyone who can read the journal logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Private RSA keys and certificates, which are highly sensitive, are being exposed through the system logs.
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Storing cryptographic keys as environment variables is a poor security practice, leading to exposure via logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromise of Confidentiality:** Attackers who gain access to the systemd journal can extract the private keys.
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** The exposed private keys could allow attackers to impersonate services and gain unauthorized access to systems and resources protected by those keys.
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** With access to private keys an attacker might be able to perform MITM attacks and intercept and modify communications

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Systemd Journal Access:** Attackers need to gain access to the system's journal logs. This can be achieved through various means such as:
  -  Compromising the node where the openshift-node is running.
  -  Exploiting any vulnerability that would allow access to system logs.
  -  Gaining unauthorized access through a misconfiguration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to System Logs:** The attacker needs to have read access to the systemd journal where the logs are being stored. This could be a local user on the node, or an attacker with compromised credentials for log access.
- **Technical knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to extract and use the private keys to perform further attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was identified within the OpenShift Origin project, and a fix was suggested which involved preventing the storage of keys as env vars.
- The CVE ID was assigned after the issue was made public and the vendor directed the reporter to request a CVE.
