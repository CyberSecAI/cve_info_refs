Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8929:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content confirms that the memory leak in the `__archive_read_get_extract` function within `archive_read_extract2.c` is indeed associated with CVE-2015-8929. Multiple sources directly link this CVE to the identified memory leak.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a memory leak in the `__archive_read_get_extract` function within `archive_read_extract2.c`. The variable 'extract', allocated at line 100, was not being freed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The code allocates memory for 'extract' but fails to deallocate it, causing a gradual accumulation of memory with repeated usage.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Repeatedly opening and extracting files, specifically crafted ones, can lead to the consumption of available memory, eventually causing the application to crash or become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Archive File:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted TAR archive file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Position:** An attacker does not require local access. They can send a malicious archive file remotely to a vulnerable system.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires a user to open or process a malicious archive using a vulnerable version of `libarchive` or a tool that utilizes it.

**Additional Notes:**

- **libarchive versions affected:**  Versions prior to 3.2.0 are vulnerable.
- **Identified via Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing, a technique of feeding invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a program and checking the behavior of the program or system.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it gives the specific function and file, as well as the memory allocation and lack of deallocation as the root cause.
