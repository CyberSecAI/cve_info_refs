**Vulnerable App:**

```
Advisory ID: HTB23282
Product: Zen Cart
Vendor: Zen Ventures, LLC
Vulnerable Version(s): 1.5.4
Tested Version: 1.5.4
Advisory Publication:  November 25, 2015  [without technical details]
Vendor Notification: November 25, 2015
Vendor Patch: November 26, 2015
Public Disclosure: December 16, 2015
Vulnerability Type: PHP File Inclusion [CWE-98]
CVE Reference: CVE-2015-8352
Risk Level: Critical
CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.0 [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H]
Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor
Discovered and Provided: High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab ( https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/ )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered critical vulnerability in a popular e-commerce software Zen Cart, which can be exploited by remote non-authenticated attackers to compromise vulnerable system. A remote unauthenticated attacker might be able to execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system, run arbitrary system commands, gain complete access to application's database and obtain information of all website users.

The vulnerability exists due to absence of filtration of directory traversal sequences in "act" HTTP GET parameter in "/ajax.php" script, when including local PHP files using 'require()' PHP function. A remote unauthenticated attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the target system with privileges of the web server.

A simple exploit below will include file "/tmp/file.php" and execute its content:

http://[host]/ajax.php?method=1&act=/../../../../tmp/file

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Apply vendor's patch.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

   ## Default Security Patches for v1.5.4 - November 2015

   > While it's never pleasant to report about security problems, today we are announcing a few patches which should be applied to your Zen Cart store.
   >
   >
   >
   >
   >
   > **1. Problem with /ajax.php in v1.5.4 only - Severity: High**
   >
   > In Zen Cart v1.5.4 the /ajax.php file has a vulnerability which can be used to cause a server exploit under very specific conditions.
   >
   > The patch is simple: replace the /ajax.php file with the one attached below.
   >
   > Thanks to [High Tech Bridge](https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23282) for reporting the problem.
   >
   >
   >
   > QUICK PATCH TO APPLY: /[ajax.php](https://www.zen-cart.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=15828&d=1448645307 "Name:  ajax.php
   > Views: 2436
   > Size:  1.1 KB")
   >
   >
   >
   >
   >
   > **Below are some additional lower-severity patches** affecting prior versions, which should be reviewed carefully for your site, to merge with existing customizations you may have made:
   >
   >
   >
   > **2. XSS problem for unsanitized comment field - Severity: Medium**
   >
   > In Zen Cart versions up to and including v1.5.4 an XSS problem exists with the order-comments field.
   >
   > XSS problems are where someone can drop in executable/javascript code that can cause problems later when that content is output back to the screen.
   >
   > The fix for this is a simple one-line patch to /includes/modules/pages/checkout\_confirmation/header\_php.php, as shown in this code diff: [XSS fix](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/pull/563/files)
   >
   > Thanks to Trustwave Security for alerting us to this issue.
   >
   > The attached checkout\_confirmation header\_php.php is for v1.3.9-thru-v1.5.4 only. Older versions should be patched manually using the code diff in the link above.
   >
   > Patched file: /includes/modules/pages/checkout\_confirmation/[header\_php.php](https://www.zen-cart.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=15825&d=1448566886 "Name:  header_php.php
   > Views: 1758
   > Size:  6.8 KB")
   >
   >
   >
   >
   >
   > **3. Failed customer login puts password back in input box - Severity: Low**
   >
   > When attempting a login with an invalid password, the resulting response contains that invalid password.
   >
   > The fix for this is a simple edit to the /includes/functions/html\_output.php file, as shown in this code diff: [XSS fix](https://github.com/zencart/zencart/pull/563/files)
   >
   > For v1.5.4 one can apply the attached html\_output.php file to /includes/functions/html\_output.php ... or if you've customized that file via plugins, use the above code-diff link to find the one line to change.
   >
   > Thanks to Trustwave Security for alerting us to this issue.
   >
   >
   >
   > Patched file: /includes/functions/[html\_output.php](https://www.zen-cart.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=15826&d=1448567110 "Name:  html_output.php
   > Views: 1505
   > Size:  22.7 KB")
   >
   >
   >
   >
   >
   > **4. XSS concerns on the Admin side - Severity: Low** because of working CSRF protections.
   >
   > Trustwave Security has reported that some fields on admin edit screens are at risk of XSS exploitation. A patch is being prepared, but it is important to note that none of these concerns can be exploited without having a valid Admin login already. So, the problems could only be caused by persons already having permission to access the admin area and intentionally placing malicious code into the affected fields. The Zen Cart Admin area is already protected against CSRF vulnerabilities so these XSS issues cannot be exploited by third parties.
