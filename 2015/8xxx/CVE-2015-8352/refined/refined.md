Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of directory traversal sequences in the "act" HTTP GET parameter within the `/ajax.php` script. This allows for local PHP file inclusion through the `require()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the "act" parameter. This is due to the insufficient input validation.
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows directory traversal using sequences like `../`, which are not properly filtered. This allows attackers to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file, attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **System Command Execution:** RCE can further lead to the execution of arbitrary system commands.
- **Database Access:** Successful exploitation can provide complete access to the application's database.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including details about website users.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Ultimately, the vulnerability allows for a complete compromise of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a specific "act" parameter.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication, making it easy to target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/ajax.php` script.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of target file paths:** The attacker must know the path of the file they want to include.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- Zen Cart version 1.5.4 is affected.
- A patch was released by the vendor.
- The CVSSv3 base score is 9.0, indicating a critical severity.
- The specific vulnerable file is `/ajax.php`.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement).
