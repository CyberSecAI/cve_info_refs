Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8341:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to release mappings of kernel and initrd files when building a guest domain in libxl. When a guest is configured to use a PV bootloader (like pygrub) and domain building fails, these mappings are not cleared, resulting in resource leaks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Resource leak:** The primary issue is a leak of virtual address space in the toolstack process due to the failure to unmap kernel and initrd files on domain creation errors.
- **File accumulation:** Temporary disk files containing the kernel and initrd are also not removed, which can lead to filesystem exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker who can repeatedly start domain creation using the vulnerable PV bootloader can exhaust memory in the toolstack process, causing a denial of service.
- **Filesystem exhaustion:** The accumulation of temporary files can lead to a denial of service against other services reliant on the same filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering failures in guest domain creation using a PV bootloader which runs as a userspace process in the toolstack domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to initiate the creation of a guest domain in Xen with a specific configuration.
- For DoS of the toolstack: Access to repeatedly start and fail domain creations within the same toolstack process.
- For Filesystem exhaustion: access to initiate a sufficiently high number of domain creations that fail, leading to temporary file build up on disk.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to libxl-based toolstacks that manage multiple domains within the same process (like libvirt), single-domain toolstacks like "xl" that exit on failure are not vulnerable.
- Only PV bootloaders that run in the toolstack domain (e.g., pygrub) are affected; pvgrub (running in the guest context) is not.
- x86 HVM domains are not vulnerable, and neither are systems where the kernel/initrd are provided from Dom0.
- The vulnerability affects Xen versions 4.1.x and later.
- A patch is available to fix the issue which has been released as part of XSA-160.
