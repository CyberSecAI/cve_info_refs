Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-8763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the EAP-PWD module of FreeRADIUS.
*   Specifically, the issue is a lack of validation of the payload length within EAP-PWD commit and confirm messages before decoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Read Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a read overflow. Since the code doesn't check the lengths of the payload within the commit and confirm messages, a malicious attacker could send a crafted packet with an invalid payload length, leading the server to read past the bounds of allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The read overflow can lead to a crash of the FreeRADIUS server. This would result in a denial of service (DoS), as the server would become unavailable for authentication requests.
* It can potentially leak information from the server's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted EAP-PWD packets. A malicious EAP peer can send a modified EAP-PWD commit or confirm message with an invalid payload length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the FreeRADIUS server as an EAP peer. This implies they need to be able to send EAP-PWD packets to the server.
* The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
* The EAP-PWD module needs to be manually enabled in the FreeRADIUS server configuration for the vulnerability to be present.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided text also mentions a related vulnerability (CVE-2015-8762) which is a NULL pointer dereference caused by not checking packet length. This vulnerability is separate but related.
*   The text also mentions CVE-2015-8764 which relates to a buffer overflow due to the use of strcpy.
*   The vulnerability is present in FreeRADIUS versions 3.0 up to 3.0.8.
* The fix involves validating the payload lengths of commit and confirm messages.
