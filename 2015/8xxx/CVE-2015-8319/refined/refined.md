- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the HIFI driver due to improper validation of parameters received from applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - System crash
    - Privilege escalation
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A malicious application installed on the device sends crafted parameters to the HIFI driver via system calls, triggering the heap overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application on the phone.
    - The malicious application must have the ability to make system calls to access the HIFI driver interface.
