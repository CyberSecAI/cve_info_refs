Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a design flaw in the Linux kernel's mbcache (meta block cache) implementation used by the ext2 and ext4 filesystems for caching extended attributes (xattrs). The original mbcache design was over-engineered, leading to complex locking, larger cache entries and more code complexity. This design resulted in lock contention and performance issues. Specifically, when there were too many unique entries in the cache, attempts to iterate through the cache and access locks would cause soft lockups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lock Contention:** The global nature of the mbcache resulted in multiple processes contending for the same locks when trying to access or modify cached xattr blocks. This contention became severe when dealing with large numbers of unique xattr values.
- **Inefficient Cache Management:** The original mbcache implementation had a fixed size limit and an inefficient LRU implementation which resulted in performance issues and high CPU usage.
- **Lack of Per-FS Caching:** The original implementation had a single shared cache for all filesystems, which led to the same contention issues in different filesystems running under the same host OS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could trigger a soft lockup of the system by creating a large number of unique xattrs or by mounting filesystems which have a large number of xattrs and high disk IO. This can make the system unresponsive, potentially requiring a reboot.
- **Performance Degradation:** Even without a complete system hang, the lock contention and inefficient cache management would lead to significant performance degradation, making filesystem operations much slower.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability could be exploited by any local user capable of creating or modifying extended attributes on an ext2 or ext4 filesystem.
- **Workload Related:** The vulnerability was also triggered due to high disk IO during a ceph recovery process. This means that specific workloads which generate a large amount of extended attributes could also be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Containers:** Containerized environments were also vulnerable since the shared mbcache would create a denial-of-service when multiple containers had their own separate filesystem image

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify xattrs on filesystems using the vulnerable mbcache implementation.
-  No special privileges are required to cause a denial of service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by a complete reimplementation of the mbcache, now called `mbcache2`. This new implementation is per-filesystem and much more lightweight, with improved locking and cache management.
- The fix also involved switching from a global cache to a per-filesystem cache and changing the locking mechanisms.
- A benchmark was performed that shows a significant increase in performance under high load with the new implementation and that the old code lead to soft lockups.
- The vulnerability did *not* affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, or 7. It did affect newer kernels, and was specifically triggered under heavy IO conditions on ceph and samba file shares.
-  The vulnerability can also be triggered by containers and was resolved in Linux kernel version 4.6.
