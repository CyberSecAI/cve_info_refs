{
  "CVE-2015-8957": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to a flaw in handling of malformed SUN files. This can lead to a crash or other undefined behavior.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks when handling malformed SUN files. Specifically, an incorrect calculation related to the color map can lead to reading memory outside of the allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Insufficient input validation"],
    "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a potential crash or undefined behavior due to the out-of-bounds read. It could lead to a denial of service.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted SUN image file",
    "An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability through a web application or a service that processes user-provided images using ImageMagick."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SUN file to the vulnerable ImageMagick instance."
