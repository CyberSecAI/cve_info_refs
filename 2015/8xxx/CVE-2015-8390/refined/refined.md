Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-8390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `pcre_exec` function within the PCRE library. This was identified through fuzzing the `pcretest` tool.
*   The specific input that triggers the overflow was found using American Fuzzy Lop and Address Sanitizer.
*   This specific vulnerability is listed as changelog item 10 in PCRE version 8.38.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Heap overflow in the `pcre_exec` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution or a denial of service (DoS).
*   Exploiting the vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted regular expression that triggers the heap overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to supply a regular expression to an application that uses the vulnerable version of PCRE.
*   The content suggests that this is not a "regex injection" problem but rather a situation where the legitimate user provides a regex.
*   The NetApp advisory notes that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in PCRE version 8.38.
*   Gentoo's security advisory indicates that versions prior to 8.38-r1 are affected and an upgrade is required.
*   NetApp's advisory indicates that multiple products are affected, and successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, data modification or DoS.
*   The NetApp advisory also states that public discussion of this vulnerability exists.
*   The Openwall content highlights that many PCRE vulnerabilities are only exploitable if the attacker can provide a regex across a privilege boundary, which may not be common.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The NetApp advisory lists a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (CRITICAL) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

This indicates the following:

*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** None
*   **User Interaction (UI):** None
*   **Scope (S):** Unchanged
*   **Confidentiality (C):** High
*   **Integrity (I):** High
*   **Availability (A):** High

In summary, CVE-2015-8390 is a critical heap overflow vulnerability in PCRE's `pcre_exec` function that could allow remote attackers to execute code, modify data, or cause a DoS by supplying a malicious regular expression, and has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.8.
