After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2015-8931:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflows in the `get_time_t_max` and `get_time_t_min` functions within `archive_read_support_format_mtree.c` in libarchive. These functions attempt to calculate the maximum and minimum values of the time_t type by triggering signed integer overflows, which are undefined behavior in C.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Signed integer overflow: The code uses multiplication by 2 and addition which may lead to overflows in the calculations of `TIME_T_MAX` and `TIME_T_MIN`.
- Undefined Behavior:  Signed integer overflows result in undefined behavior. This means the compiler is free to generate any code, potentially leading to unexpected crashes or incorrect results.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is that a crafted mtree file may trigger the undefined behavior causing the affected program to crash, leading to a DoS.
- In some cases, it could cause certain files to be mistakenly identified as Compress archives and fail to read or application may fail to read the archive, or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted mtree file: An attacker needs to provide a malicious mtree file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input: The attacker must be able to provide a crafted mtree file as input to a system that processes it with a vulnerable version of libarchive.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `libarchive` versions prior to 3.2.0.
- The issue was triggered by compiling with `-fsanitize=undefined` (enabling undefined behavior sanitizer) when opening mtree files.
- The root cause is an attempt to calculate `TIME_T_MIN` and `TIME_T_MAX` using integer overflows, which is undefined behavior according to the C standard.
- Upstream fix commit: `f0b1dbb` (<https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/f0b1dbb>), `b31744d` (<https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/b31744d> and `c0c52e9` (<https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/c0c52e9aaafb0860c4151c5374372051e9354301>)
- Affected software includes multiple Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, SUSE, Gentoo, and Ubuntu.
- Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1348779 and SUSE Bugzilla 985689 track this issue.
- SUSE CVSS v2 score is 4.3 and National Vulnerability Database score is 6.8 for CVE-2015-8931.
- The vulnerability is considered low/moderate severity by various sources.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-8931 describes a vulnerability in libarchive stemming from integer overflows when calculating date values in the mtree parser. This vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition when processing a crafted mtree file. Attackers would need to provide a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
