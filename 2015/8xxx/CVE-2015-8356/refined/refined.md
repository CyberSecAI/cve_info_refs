Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed via HTTP GET parameters in the mcart.xls Bitrix module. Specifically, the `xls_profile` parameter in `/bitrix/admin/mcart_xls_import.php` and `xls_iblock_id`, `xls_iblock_section_id`, `firstRow`, `titleRow`, `firstColumn`, `highestColumn`, `sku_iblock_id`, and `xls_iblock_section_id_new` parameters in `/bitrix/admin/mcart_xls_import_step_2.php` are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries to potentially obtain sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Complete Control:** By gaining database access, attackers could potentially gain complete control over the vulnerable website.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting SQL injection, it is possible to write arbitrary php code in a file, if the mysql user has the necessary permissions, and achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are passed via HTTP GET requests to the mentioned PHP scripts.
- **CSRF:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because the application does not check the origin of requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Initially, the attacker needs to be authorized against the website and have access to the vulnerable module.
- **CSRF Exploitation:** An attacker can create a malicious page with a CSRF exploit. A victim visiting this page while being authenticated on the vulnerable website would then trigger the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server and possibly DNS if performing DNS exfiltration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit details include Proof-of-Concept (PoC) examples demonstrating how to extract data using DNS exfiltration and how to write arbitrary php code in a file.
- The advisory highlights the vendor's lack of response to multiple notifications.
- The advisory states that there isn't any official solution for this vulnerability known.
