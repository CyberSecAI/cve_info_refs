Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the server-side implementation of the EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol in the `eap-mschapv2` plugin of strongSwan.
*   The core issue is **insufficient validation of the local state** during the EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication process. Specifically, the server doesn't properly verify that a Master Session Key (MSK) has been established during the authentication exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The lack of proper state validation allows a malicious client to bypass the authentication process entirely.
*   **Missing MSK Establishment Check**: The server fails to check if the MSK is established.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can successfully authenticate without providing valid credentials, gaining unauthorized access to the network or system resources.
*   **No Session Key:** Successful bypass results in no MSK being established. This can be logged by the server, but it does not prevent the bypass.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by any client initiating an IKEv2 connection using EAP-MSCHAPv2 for authentication.
*   **EAP-MSCHAPv2 Protocol:** The attack specifically targets the EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication method.
*   **Specific Configurations:** The vulnerability affects strongSwan installations using the following configurations:
    *   `rightauth=eap-mschapv2`
    *   `rightauth=eap-peap|ttls` with `phase2_method = mschapv2`
    *   `rightauth=eap-dynamic` with the `eap-mschapv2` plugin loaded

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the strongSwan server.
*   **IKEv2 Client:** The attacker needs to be able to act as an IKEv2 client.
*   **EAP-MSCHAPv2 Negotiation:** The attacker needs to initiate an authentication attempt using the vulnerable EAP-MSCHAPv2 method.
*   **Simple Exploit:** The attacker only needs to send an empty EAP success message as a response to an initial challenge message from the server to successfully bypass authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All strongSwan versions from 4.2.12 up to and including 5.3.3 are affected.
*   **Detection:**  A log message  `EAP method EAP_MSCHAPV2 succeeded, no MSK established` on the server indicates a successful bypass attempt.
*   **Unaffected Configurations:** Installations that use RADIUS to provide EAP-MSCHAPv2 authentication (`rightauth=eap-radius`) are not affected, provided the RADIUS server's implementation is correct.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in strongSwan version 5.3.4. Patches are also available for older releases.
*   **CVSS Score:** The SUSE CVSSv2 score for this vulnerability is 7.5, with the vector being AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2811-1 addresses this vulnerability.
*   **Debian:** Debian Security Advisory DSA-3398-1 addresses this issue.
