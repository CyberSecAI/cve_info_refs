Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-8664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `WebCursor::Deserialize` function within Chromium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The vulnerability lies in how the `WebCursor::Deserialize` function handles incoming data, specifically, it fails to properly validate the size of data leading to an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The overflow can lead to an application crash, effectively denying service to the user.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: In a more severe scenario, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected program. This is possible due to the memory corruption that arises from the integer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted website. An attacker can trick a user into visiting a malicious website which would trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a web page and convince the user to visit it with a vulnerable browser. This doesn't require any pre-existing access to the user's system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the Oxide package update.
- The fix is also in Chrome version 47.0.2526.106
- The provided content mentions that the vulnerability could be triggered by opening a "specially crafted website". This suggests that the attacker would need to have some knowledge of the specific input values that would trigger the overflow.
- The provided material includes references to the Chromium issue tracker. This indicates that the vulnerability was initially discovered within the Chromium project and then fixed in both Chromium and Oxide.
-The fix was committed to the Chromium project with commit ID `4daf403ca4dfcfbce6a40574bf3da6b7fec9342f`

This is a medium to high severity vulnerability, as it allows for denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution through a relatively simple attack vector.
