- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Buffalo AirStation Extreme N600 Router uses static source ports and predictable TXIDs for DNS queries originating from the LAN. The TXIDs increment from 0x0002.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently random values for DNS queries (CWE-330).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can spoof DNS responses, causing LAN clients to connect to incorrect or malicious hosts controlled by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to spoof DNS responses on the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and spoof DNS responses. They do not need to be authenticated to the router.
