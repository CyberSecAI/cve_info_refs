The provided content discusses multiple DLL hijacking vulnerabilities, and CVE-2015-8264 is mentioned as one of the related, already fixed vulnerabilities. However, the text does not describe the specifics of CVE-2015-8264. The following vulnerabilities are discussed in detail:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Executable installers/self-extractors based on Microsoft's SFXCAB load and execute a rogue CryptDll.dll from their application directory instead of the system's CryptDll.dll.
*   **Weakness:** DLL hijacking, insecure DLL loading.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation (due to installers often requiring administrator privileges).
*   **Attack vector:** Placing a malicious CryptDll.dll in the same directory as a vulnerable SFXCAB installer/self-extractor. This can be achieved through drive-by downloads or social engineering.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to place a file in a user-writable directory, such as the "Downloads" folder, and trick the user into executing a vulnerable installer.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** AntiMalware Definition Updaters (MPAM-D.exe and MPAM-FE[x64].exe) load and execute a rogue Cabinet.dll from their application directory.
*   **Weakness:** DLL hijacking, insecure DLL loading.
*   **Impact:** Code execution
*   **Attack vector:** Placing a malicious Cabinet.dll in the same directory as MPAM-D.exe or MPAM-FE[x64].exe.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to place a file in the same directory where the update executables are downloaded, which can be user's desktop based on Microsoft's instructions.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** `LoadLibrary("URL.dll")` or `LoadLibrary("C:\Windows\System32\URL.dll")` loads a rogue OLEAcc.dll from the application directory.
*   **Weakness:** DLL hijacking, insecure DLL loading.
*   **Impact:** Code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Placing a malicious OLEAcc.dll in the application's directory.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to place a file in the application's directory.

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** `LoadLibrary("CryptUI.dll")` or `LoadLibrary("C:\Windows\System32\CryptUI.dll")` loads a rogue RichEd20.dll from the application directory.
*   **Weakness:** DLL hijacking, insecure DLL loading.
*  **Impact:** Code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Placing a malicious RichEd20.dll in the application's directory.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to place a file in the application's directory.

**Vulnerability 5:**

*   **Root cause:** `ShellExecuteEx()` and `ShellExecute()` load several DLLs (DWMAPI.dll, SetupAPI.dll, COMRes.dll, ClbCatQ.dll, WTSAPI32.dll, UXTHEME.dll, RICHED20.dll) from the application directory.
*   **Weakness:** DLL hijacking, insecure DLL loading.
*   **Impact:** Code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Placing malicious DLLs in the application's directory.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to place files in the application's directory.

The content highlights a recurring pattern of insecure DLL loading practices in various Microsoft components and executables, where they load DLLs from the application directory instead of the system directory, leading to DLL hijacking vulnerabilities.

The content does mention CVE-2015-8264, but provides no further information about it other than it being related to the same kind of vulnerability (DLL hijacking). Therefore, the response below will indicate that this is related to the CVE, but NOINFO can be provided for the details of that specific vulnerability.
