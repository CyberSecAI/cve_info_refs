Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Echo extension in MediaWiki failed to properly check if a username was suppressed or deleted when generating notifications for non-revision based events, such as "thanks" notifications. It only checked for suppression/deletion for revision-based notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Leak:** Suppressed or deleted usernames were being displayed in notifications, which should have been replaced with a generic "username removed" message.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code did not consistently check for user suppression or deletion across all notification types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Users who had their usernames suppressed or deleted would still have their usernames visible in certain notifications to other users. This could reveal information that was intended to be hidden.
*   **Loss of Anonymity/Privacy:**  The vulnerability compromised the privacy of users who had their usernames hidden due to abuse or other reasons.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interaction:** An attacker could create an "abusive" username, have it suppressed by an administrator, then thank other users. The recipients of these "thanks" notifications would see the suppressed abusive username.
*  **Non-revision based notifications:** Any non-revision based notification, such as user-rights notifications (though deemed unlikely), were also vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User:** Any user could potentially trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of System:** No particular expertise was required to exploit this vulnerability, it was more about how the system handled notifications.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The fix involved checking `User::isHidden()` in addition to revdel flags.
*   The initial patch did not correctly handle the "thanks" case because it incorrectly used the current user's revision ID instead of the thankee user. This was corrected in a subsequent patch.
*   There were concerns about the performance of `User::isHidden()` due to potential database queries. However, it was determined to be the best solution after discussion.
*  The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2015-8007 on Nov 3 2015, and it was announced in a security release on October 17, 2015.
