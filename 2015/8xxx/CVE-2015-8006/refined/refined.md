Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause was the lack of proper URL and HTML encoding of the page title within the history link in the PageTriage toolbar. The page title was directly inserted into the `href` attribute of an HTML `<a>` tag without escaping or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS. Because the page title was not sanitized or encoded, it allowed the injection of malicious code (JavaScript) into the HTML context.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system did not properly sanitize or encode the page title before inserting it into the HTML, which is the core issue leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when hovering over the "show full history" link in the PageTriage toolbar. This could be used to:
   -  Steal cookies or session tokens
   -  Redirect the user to a malicious website
   -  Perform actions on behalf of the user
   -  Deface the webpage
   -  Potentially gain more control of the victim's browser/machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Page Title:** The attack vector involves crafting a page title containing malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `onmouseover="alert(0);" or onmouseover="$.getScript('http://127.0.0.1/t.js')"`).
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to hover over the "show full history" link for the JavaScript to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Page Creation Privilege:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create a page with a malicious title.
- **Patrolling Account:** The attacker needs to have access to a patrolling account (i.e., an account that can patrol pages) to see the PageTriage toolbar.
- **No direct interaction with the victim's browser:** Once the crafted page has been created and reviewed via patrolling account, the attacker is not needed for the actual exploitation to occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- The initial fix involved URL encoding the page title, which mitigated some issues but didn't fully address the XSS vulnerability.
- The second patch included HTML escaping the title, correctly resolving the XSS issue
- The vulnerability is DOM-based because the injection point is in the HTML generated by the browser based on user input and not a reflection from the server.
- The vulnerability was present in the `ext.pageTriage.views.toolbar` module and more specifically, within `ext.pageTriage.articleInfo.html` template.
