Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8866:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2015-8866 is relevant to the security advisory discussed. The advisory, specifically `RHSA-2016:2750` and `USN-2952-1`, lists CVE-2015-8866 as one of the security issues addressed. The CVE description in the advisory aligns with the upstream description provided by Red Hat. 

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the PHP implementation of `libxml_disable_entity_loader()`, where the setting of this function is shared between threads.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core issue is the lack of thread-local isolation for the libxml entity loader disabling setting. This means if one thread/request disables the entity loader using `libxml_disable_entity_loader()`, this change might affect subsequent requests in other threads/processes within the PHP-FPM environment.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform XXE attacks. They could inject malicious external entities in XML data, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive local file contents or interaction with other systems that the server has access to.
    *   **XML Entity Expansion (XEE):** An attacker might exploit this setting to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by including XML entities that expand to extremely large sizes, which could overwhelm the server's resources.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted XML document to a PHP application.
    *   This attack vector is applicable to PHP applications using XML parsing functionality and running in a multi-threaded environment, especially with PHP-FPM.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send XML data to a PHP application.
    *   No specific privileges or positions are needed, as this is a remote attack vector.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The Red Hat advisory also notes the issue occurs when running under PHP-FPM.
*   The Ubuntu advisory notes that this issue applies only to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS.
*   The Red Hat security advisory states that the described vulnerability could lead to:
    *   PHP crashes
    *   Disclosure of portions of its memory
    *   Execution of arbitrary code
    *   Impact PHP application integrity.
*   The description from the Red Hat security advisory includes "Space precludes documenting each of these issues in this advisory". This suggests that other vulnerabilities in PHP may have similar potential impacts which are not detailed specifically.
*   The provided Red Hat RHSA indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in `rh-php56` version `2.3-1`.
*   The Ubuntu USN notes that the vulnerability was introduced in a backport patch, where setting `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` was shared between threads.
*   The php.net changelog confirms this issue and the vulnerability associated with it, and notes that the fix was introduced in php version 5.6.25.
*  The SUSE information describes the vulnerability as affecting `php5` packages, and that a fix was released as `php5-devel >= 5.5.14-56.1`.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla report includes a comment by Remi Collet pointing out that the vulnerability exists in PHP-FPM due to a missing fix.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a shared thread-local setting in PHP's libxml component, which can lead to XXE and XEE attacks by a remote attacker if the `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function is used. The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by including the specific scenario of the vulnerability occurring within PHP-FPM.
