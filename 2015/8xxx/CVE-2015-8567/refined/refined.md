This is caused by missing checks before activating the device and failing to free transmit/receive buffers during deactivation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Memory Leak
- Missing check for active status before activation.
- Failing to release transmit and receive buffers during deactivation

Impact of exploitation:
A malicious guest can cause a denial of service on the host through memory exhaustion by repeatedly activating the vmxnet3 device.

Attack vectors:
A malicious guest can trigger the memory leak by repeatedly activating the vmxnet3 device.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
A malicious guest administrator with the ability to repeatedly activate the vmxnet3 device.
