  "CVE-2015-8863": {
    "Description": "Off-by-one error in the tokenadd function in jv_parse.c in jq allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long JSON-encoded number, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An off-by-one error in the `tokenadd` function within `jv_parse.c` causes a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect memory allocation size when handling long JSON-encoded numbers.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting a specific JSON file.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JSON input to the affected application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a JSON input to a system running a vulnerable version of `jq`."
