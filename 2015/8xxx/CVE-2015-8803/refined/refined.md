{
  "CVE-2015-8803": {
    "Description": "The ecc_256_modp function in ecc-256.c in Nettle before 3.2 does not properly handle carry propagation and produces incorrect output in its implementation of the P-256 NIST elliptic curve, which allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8805.",
    "Root cause": "Miscomputation in the elliptic curve scalar multiplication due to incorrect handling of carry propagation in the ecc_256_modp function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of the P-256 NIST elliptic curve due to flawed carry propagation logic.",
	  "Improper handling of carry bits during modular arithmetic operations in elliptic curve calculations."
    ],
    "Impact": "Incorrect results in elliptic curve calculations.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability through unknown vectors, leading to unspecified impact.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities or position mentioned beyond the ability to provide malicious inputs that trigger the vulnerable code."
