Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8725:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `dissect_diameter_base_framed_ipv6_prefix` function within the DIAMETER dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. The dissector does not properly validate the size of the IPv6 prefix, leading to writing past the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A crash of the Wireshark application can be triggered by a malformed packet.
- Potentially remote attackers could cause denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By injecting a malformed DIAMETER packet onto the network.
- By convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to a system running Wireshark or provide a capture file containing the malicious packet.
