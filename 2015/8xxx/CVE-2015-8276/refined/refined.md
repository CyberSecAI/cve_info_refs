Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-8276:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way "eParakstitajs 3.0" (1.3.0) and "edoc-libraries-2.5.4_01" process EDOC files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software is susceptible to arbitrary file reading due to the way it handles specially crafted EDOC files. This indicates a lack of proper validation or sanitization of file paths within the EDOC file, allowing for path traversal or similar issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the file system where the vulnerable software is installed and executed. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the creation of specifically crafted EDOC files. An attacker would need to entice the victim to open or process this maliciously crafted EDOC file using the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a specially crafted EDOC file. They also need to convince the victim to process this file using the vulnerable software.
