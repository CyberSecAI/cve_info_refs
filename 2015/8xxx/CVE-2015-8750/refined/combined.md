You can see this with readelf:  % readelf --debug-dump=abbrev awbug6.elf section '.debug_abbrev' has the NOBITS type - its contents are unreliable.

Do you mean send email to libdwarf-list ? However, I had sent mail to this email but no reply received.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1294264#c4)  xqx    2015-12-30 14:44:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tom Hughes from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1294264#c2)) > The problem is that the debug_abbrev section is marked as NOBITS in the ELF > file - in other words as a zero-init section rather than a section with > contents in the file.
