Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the `_dwarf_get_abbrev_for_code` function within `dwarf_util.c` of the libdwarf library. This occurs when the `.debug_abbrev` section of an ELF file is incorrectly marked as `NOBITS`, indicating a zero-initialized section without actual content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a pointer (`abbrev_ptr`) without ensuring it's valid, leading to a crash when the `.debug_abbrev` section is invalid. Specifically, line 454 of `dwarf_utils.c` `if (*abbrev_ptr == 0)` attempts to access memory at a null address when `abbrev_ptr` is null.
- **Improper Handling of Corrupted/Malformed ELF Files:** libdwarf does not gracefully handle ELF files with a malformed `.debug_abbrev` section marked as `NOBITS`, resulting in a crash instead of an error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the application using libdwarf, leading to a denial of service. This is confirmed by the valgrind output showing a `SIGSEGV` signal, which means that the process will terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted ELF Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ELF file to a program that uses the vulnerable libdwarf library. The crafted file would have its `.debug_abbrev` section marked as `NOBITS`.
- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was initially discovered through fuzzing, which suggests it can be triggered by providing a range of slightly malformed inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted ELF file to an application that uses a vulnerable version of libdwarf, or an ability to influence the parsing of such files.
- No specific privilege level is mentioned and based on the information provided, this can be exploited by any user who has the ability to provide this type of crafted file to the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed upstream in libdwarf, by making sure that the code gracefully handles this situation and reports an error instead of crashing.
- The fix is included in `libdwarf-20151114-3.fc24` build.
