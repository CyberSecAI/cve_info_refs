- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper bounds checking in server command processing within IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with system privileges or cause the application to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to the target's TCP port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker, no authentication needed.
