Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security advisory:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-8756 (although the content states "CVE: not assigned yet", it does align with the advisory content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly encode editor input within the search result view of the `indexed_search` component. This lack of encoding allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `indexed_search` component.
- Improper input sanitization/encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated editor can inject arbitrary HTML code into the search result view.
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Malicious script execution within the context of a user's browser.
    - Potential for session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the affected pages.
    - Phishing attacks and other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user with editor privileges can inject malicious HTML into the `indexed_search` component.
- The injected code would be executed when other users view search results.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with editor privileges to inject the malicious code.

**Affected Versions:**
- TYPO3 versions 6.2.0 to 6.2.15 are affected.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to TYPO3 version 6.2.16 or later, which includes the fix for the reported vulnerability.
