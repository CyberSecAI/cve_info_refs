The provided content indicates that CVE-2015-8855 is assigned to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in the `semver` package for Node.js, specifically in versions before 4.3.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `semver` package had a flaw in its regular expression processing that made it vulnerable to ReDoS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted input string to the vulnerable function, which would result in excessive CPU consumption, making the application unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a crafted string to the semver parsing function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable semver parsing function. This could be from user input, file uploads, or other methods where an application processes strings with the vulnerable function.
