{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap out of bounds read when reading password for a malformed ZIP archive.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `trad_enc_decrypt_update` function in `archive_read_support_format_zip.c` performs an invalid memory read when processing a password-protected ZIP archive with an empty password. The vulnerability occurs because of a heap-buffer-overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a malformed, password-protected ZIP archive. An attacker could provide such a file to a user, and if the user attempts to extract it with an empty password, the vulnerability can be triggered.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted, password-protected ZIP file to a user who is using a vulnerable version of libarchive."
