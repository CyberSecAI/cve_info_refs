# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2015-10-17 09:10:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1353](attachment.cgi?id=1353 "Description") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1353&action=edit "Description") Description  ntpq processes incoming packets in a loop in getresponse().  The loop's only stopping conditions are receiving a complete and correct response or hitting a small number of error conditions.  If the packet contains incorrect values that don't trigger one of the error conditions, the loop continues to receive new packets. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c1)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-10-17 09:34:29 UTC  ``` After thinking for a while over the problem, I propose to use a timeout-based limit between the query and the first valid reply, and between a valid reply and the next reply if such is expected. If there is no proper answer in that time window, raise a timeout condition.  Currently the timeout is just for the reception of any packet, and both NTPQ and NTPDC can be easily fooled this way.  I will start to implement this proposal, but please tell me ASAP if you see a problem with this procedure! ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c2)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-10-17 19:18:51 UTC  ``` The repo with the fix is in    psp.ntp.org:~perlinger/ntp-stable-2948  Fixed both ntpq and ntpdc. Test script for python3(!!) available. Run both ntpd and ntpdc with sufficient debug level to see what happens before and after the changes. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c3)  Juergen Perlinger    2015-10-17 19:21:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1355](attachment.cgi?id=1355 "generator for fake replies") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1355&action=edit "generator for fake replies") generator for fake replies ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-14 08:13:59 UTC  ``` Pearly,  Thanks for your work on this.  STAGED for 4.2.8p6. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2948#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2016-01-20 12:26:34 UTC  ``` Resolved in 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.90. ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A2583)

## Topic

An update for ntp is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time with another referenced time source. These packages include the ntpd service which continuously adjusts system time and utilities used to query and configure the ntpd service.

Security Fix(es):

* It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-9750 was incomplete: three issues were found in the value length checks in NTP's ntp\_crypto.c, where a packet with particular autokey operations that contained malicious data was not always being completely validated. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted NTP packet to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702)
* A memory leak flaw was found in ntpd's CRYPTO\_ASSOC. If ntpd was configured to use autokey authentication, an attacker could send packets to ntpd that would, after several days of ongoing attack, cause it to run out of memory. (CVE-2015-7701)
* An off-by-one flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in cookedprint functionality of ntpq. A specially crafted NTP packet could potentially cause ntpq to crash. (CVE-2015-7852)
* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7977)
* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way ntpd processed 'ntpdc reslist' commands that queried restriction lists with a large amount of entries. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash ntpd. (CVE-2015-7978)
* It was found that when NTP was configured in broadcast mode, a remote attacker could broadcast packets with bad authentication to all clients. The clients, upon receiving the malformed packets, would break the association with the broadcast server, causing them to become out of sync over a longer period of time. (CVE-2015-7979)
* It was found that ntpd could crash due to an uninitialized variable when processing malformed logconfig configuration commands. (CVE-2015-5194)
* It was found that ntpd would exit with a segmentation fault when a statistics type that was not enabled during compilation (e.g. timingstats) was referenced by the statistics or filegen configuration command. (CVE-2015-5195)
* It was found that NTP's :config command could be used to set the pidfile and driftfile paths without any restrictions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to overwrite a file on the file system with a file containing the pid of the ntpd process (immediately) or the current estimated drift of the system clock (in hourly intervals). (CVE-2015-5196, CVE-2015-7703)
* It was discovered that the sntp utility could become unresponsive due to being caught in an infinite loop when processing a crafted NTP packet. (CVE-2015-5219)
* A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A). (CVE-2015-7974)
* A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client processed certain incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. (CVE-2015-8158)

The CVE-2015-5219 and CVE-2015-7703 issues were discovered by Miroslav Lichvár (Red Hat).

It is possible to store a data value that is larger than the size of the buffer that the ctl\_getitem() function of ntpd uses to report the return value. If the length of the requested data value returned by ctl\_getitem() is too large, the value NULL is returned instead. There are 2 cases where the return value from ctl\_getitem() was not directly checked to make sure it's not NULL, but there are subsequent INSIST() checks that make sure the return value is not NULL. There are no data values ordinarily stored in ntpd that would exceed this buffer length. But if one has permission to store values and one stores a value that is "too large", then ntpd will abort if an attempt is made to read that oversized value.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation -** CVE-2015-7704**,** CVE-2015-7705An ntpd client that honors Kiss-of-Death (KoD) responses will honor KoD messages that have been forged by an attacker, causing it to delay or stop querying its servers for time updates. Also, an attacker can forge packets that claim to be from the target and send them to servers often enough that a server that implements KoD rate limiting will send the target machine a KoD response to attempt to reduce the rate of incoming packets, or it may also trigger a firewall block at the server for packets from the target machine. For either of these attacks to succeed, the attacker must know what servers the target is communicating with. An attacker can be anywhere on the Internet and can frequently learn the identity of the target's time source by sending the target a time query. For more information on these vulnerabilities, please see NTP.org's [April 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security) as well as the [January 2016 security advisory](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit). |

CVE Name: CVE-2015-7973, CVE-2015-7974, CVE-2015-7975, CVE-2015-7976,
CVE-2015-7977, CVE-2015-7978, CVE-2015-7979, CVE-2015-8138,
CVE-2015-8139, CVE-2015-8140, CVE-2015-8158
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ntpd(8) daemon is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
used to synchronize the time of a computer system to a reference time
source.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ntp 4.2.8p5:
Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq. [CVE-2015-8158]
A logic error would allow packets with an origin timestamp of zero
to bypass this check whenever there is not an outstanding request
to the server. [CVE-2015-8138]
Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast mode.
[CVE-2015-7979]
Stack exhaustion in recursive traversal of restriction list. [CVE-2015-7978]
reslist NULL pointer dereference. [CVE-2015-7977]
ntpq saveconfig command allows dangerous characters in filenames.
[CVE-2015-7976]
nextvar() missing length check. [CVE-2015-7975]
Skeleton Key: Missing key check allows impersonation between authenticated
peers. [CVE-2015-7974]
Deja Vu: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode. [CVE-2015-7973]
ntpq vulnerable to replay attacks. [CVE-2015-8140]
Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc, disclose origin. [CVE-2015-8139]
III. Impact
A malicious NTP server, or an attacker who can conduct MITM attack by
intercepting NTP query traffic, may be able to cause a ntpq client to
infinitely loop. [CVE-2015-8158]
A malicious NTP server, or an attacker who can conduct MITM attack by
intercepting NTP query traffic, may be able to prevent a ntpd(8) daemon
to distinguish between legitimate peer responses from forgeries. This
can partially be mitigated by configuring multiple time sources.
[CVE-2015-8138]
An off-path attacker who can send broadcast packets with bad
authentication (wrong key, mismatched key, incorrect MAC, etc) to
broadcast clients can cause these clients to tear down associations.
[CVE-2015-7979]
An attacker who can send unauthenticated 'reslist' command to a NTP
server may cause it to crash, resulting in a denial of service
condition due to stack exhaustion [CVE-2015-7978] or a NULL pointer
dereference [CVE-2015-7977].
An attacker who can send 'modify' requests to a NTP server may be
able to create file that contain dangerous characters in their name,
which could cause dangerous behavior in a later shell invocation.
[CVE-2015-7976]
A remote attacker may be able to crash a ntpq client. [CVE-2015-7975]
A malicious server which holds a trusted key may be able to
impersonate other trusted servers in an authenticated configuration.
[CVE-2015-7974]
A man-in-the-middle attacker or a malicious participant that has the
same trusted keys as the victim can replay time packets if the NTP
network is configured for broadcast operations. [CVE-2015-7973]
The ntpq protocol is vulnerable to replay attacks which may be used
to e.g. re-establish an association to malicious server. [CVE-2015-8140]
An attacker who can intercept NTP traffic can easily forge live server
responses. [CVE-2015-8139]
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running ntpd(8) are not
affected. Network administrators are advised to implement BCP-38,
which helps to reduce risk associated with the attacks.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
The ntpd service has to be restarted after the update. A reboot is
recommended but not required.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:09/ntp.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-16:09/ntp.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ntp.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/9/ r294570
releng/9.3/ r294905

#### Description

`ntpq` processes incoming packets in a loop in `getresponse()`. The loop’s only stopping conditions are receiving a complete and correct response or hitting a small number of error conditions. If the packet contains incorrect values that don’t trigger one of the error conditions, the loop continues to receive new packets.

> Note well, this is an attack against an instance of `ntpq`, not `ntpd`, and this attack requires the attacker to do one of the following:

* Own a malicious NTP server that the client trusts.
* Prevent a legitimate NTP server from sending packets to the `ntpq` client.
* [MITM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) the `ntpq` communications between the `ntpq` client and the NTP server.

---

#### Mitigation

* Upgrade to [4.2.8p6 or later.](https://downloads.nwtime.org/ntp/4.2.8/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c0)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:43:48 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the ntpq client certain processed incoming packets in a loop in the getresponse() function:  The loop's only stopping conditions are receiving a complete and correct response or hitting a small number of error conditions. If the packet contains incorrect values that don't trigger one of the error conditions, the loop continues to receive new packets.  A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to crash an ntpq client instance. This attack requires the attacker to do one of the following:  * Own a malicious NTP server that the client trusts  * Prevent a legitimate NTP server from sending packets to the 'ntpq' client  * MITM the 'ntpq' communications between the 'ntpq' client and the NTP server   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c1)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 11:51:11 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#January_2016_NTP_4_2_8p6_Securit> <http://www.talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0080/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c2)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 12:02:11 UTC  ```  Created ntp tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1300277](show_bug.cgi?id=1300277 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-7974 CVE-2015-8138 CVE-2015-7973 CVE-2015-7975 CVE-2015-7976 CVE-2015-7977 CVE-2015-7978 CVE-2015-7979 CVE-2015-8158 CVE-2015-8139 CVE-2015-8140 ntp: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1300273#c3)  Martin Prpič    2016-01-20 14:36:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.
