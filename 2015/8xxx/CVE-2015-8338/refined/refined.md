Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-8338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient enforcement of limits on page order inputs for certain `HYPERVISOR_memory_op` suboperations in Xen on ARM. Specifically, the operations `XENMEM_increase_reservation`, `XENMEM_populate_physmap`, and `XENMEM_exchange` did not have proper limits, allowing guests to specify excessively high page orders. Also, `XENMEM_decrease_reservation` enforced a higher limit than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The hypervisor failed to properly validate the page order inputs for memory operations, allowing guests to specify excessively large values.
- **Looping Vulnerability:** The affected memory operations involve loops over individual pages. A large page order results in a high iteration count, leading to prolonged execution times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service by initiating long-running memory operations, preventing the physical CPU from being used for a significant period.
- **Host Watchdog Timeout:** If a host watchdog is in use, the prolonged execution time could lead to a watchdog timeout, causing a reboot of the host.
- **Guest Watchdog Timeout:** A guest configured with a watchdog could also experience a timeout and reboot due to this issue.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not the primary impact, the possibility of privilege escalation cannot be completely ruled out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious guest administrator within a Xen virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges within a Xen guest.
- The attacker must be able to execute `HYPERVISOR_memory_op` suboperations with high page order inputs.
- The system must be running on an ARM architecture.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Xen versions supporting ARM.
- x86 versions of Xen are not affected.
- Mitigation includes limiting device passthrough to untrusted guests, and the guest kernel being controlled by the host.
- Patches are available to resolve the issue.
- The issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Citrix.
