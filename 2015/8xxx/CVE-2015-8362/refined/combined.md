## Harman AMX multimedia devices contain hard-coded credentials

#### Vulnerability Note VU#992624

Original Release Date: 2016-01-21 | Last Revised: 2016-01-27

---

### Overview

Multiple models of Harman AMX multimedia devices contain a hard-coded debug account.

### Description

| [**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - CVE-2015-8362  According to the researchers' [blog post](http://blog.sec-consult.com/2016/01/deliberately-hidden-backdoor-account-in.html), several models of Harman AMX multimedia devices contain a hard-coded "backdoor" account with administrative permissions. Further details are available in the researchers' [vulnerability advisory](https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20160121-0_AMX_Deliberately_hidden_backdoor_account_v10.txt). AMX firmware [release notes](http://www.amx.com/techcenter/firmware.asp?Category=Hot%20Fix%20Files) indicate this was a debugging account left in the released firmware.The following software versions of the AMX NX-1200 have been reported to be vulnerable:     + v1.2.322 + v1.3.100  Affected devices include but are not limited to:    + AMX NX-1200 + AMX DGX16-ENC (Digital Media Switchers) + AMX DGX32-ENC-A (Digital Media Switchers) + AMX DGX64-ENC (Digital Media Switchers) + AMX DGX8-ENC (Digital Media Switchers) + AMX DVX-2100HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-2210HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-2250HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-2255HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-3250HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-3255HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX DVX-3256HD (All-In-One Presentation Switchers) + AMX ENOVADGX64-ENC (Digital Media Switchers) + AMX MCP-106 (ControlPads) + AMX MCP-108 (ControlPads) + AMX NI-2000 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-2100 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-3000 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-3100 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-3101-SIG (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-4000 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-4100 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-700 (Central Controllers) + AMX NI-900 (Central Controllers) + AMX NX-1200 (Central Controllers) + AMX NX-2200 (Central Controllers) + AMX NX-3200 (Central Controllers) + AMX NX-4200 (Central Controllers) + AMX NXC-ME260-64 (Central Controllers) + AMX NXC-MPE (Central Controllers) + AMX NetLinx NX Integrated Controller (Media) |

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Attackers are able to completely compromise the affected devices as they can
gain higher privileges than even administrative access to the system via the
backdoor.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult not to use these products until a
thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Deliberately hidden backdoor account
While analysing the application binary /bin/bw, SEC Consult discovered a
function called "setUpSubtleUserAccount" which adds an administrative
account to the internal user database. This account can be used to log on to
the web interface as well as SSH.
Functions to retrieve a list of all users in the database were found to
deliberately hide this user. Further, using this backdoor account grants
additional features on the remote-cli, such as a facility to capture packets
on the network interface which not even an administrator account can perform.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The binary /bin/bw which provides core functionality as well as user management
for the AMX NX-1200 implements a function called "setUpSubtleUserAccount",
which is called on system boot. This function adds an administrative account
with hardcoded credentials to the user database:
STMFD   SP!, {R4-R7,LR}
LDR     R4, =aMu1cqhrnyu4 ; "QmxhY2tXaWRvdw"
SUB     SP, SP, #0x44
ADD     R12, R4, #0x38
ADD     LR, SP, #0x58+cSubtleUserPassword
MOV     R5, this
LDMIA   R12!, {this-R3} ; "<removed from PoC>"
STMIA   LR!, {R0-R3}
ADD     R3, R4, #0x54
LDMIA   R12, {R0,R1}
MOV     R4, #0
ADD     R12, SP, #0x58+cSubtleUserUserName+0x10
STR     R0, [LR],#4
STRB    R4, [R12],#1
STRH    R1, [LR],#2
ADD     R6, SP, #0x58+cSubtleUserUserName

By decoding the strings which are loaded from memory and passed as arguments to
cSubtleUserPassword and cSubtleUserUserName, the following user and password
can be recovered:
user: BlackWidow
password: <removed from PoC>

Using these credentials a successful login has been performed to the web based
management interface, as well as the command line interface. Using this
backdoor account grants additional features on the command line interface, such
as capturing packets on the network interface.

Parts of the application which display a list of users are designed to
deliberately hide the backdoor account.

The backdoor did not get removed by AMX in their first patch, but the backdoor
username has only been changed to a DC superhero name.
The new username now was: 1MB@tMaN

The hotfix from 2016-01-15 is untested by SEC Consult and it is unknown
whether the backdoor has been removed properly now. Hence the password will
not be published.

ICS-CERT recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT web site](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
