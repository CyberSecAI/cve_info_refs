Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the MediaWiki ApiUpload component's handling of chunked uploads. Specifically, the API did not properly validate if the total size of uploaded chunks exceeded the declared filesize.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of chunked upload size against the declared file size.
- The API allowed clients to send data beyond the stated file size in chunked mode.
- Lack of proper checks on the offset and length of the chunks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious client could potentially upload an unlimited number of chunks (as long as each chunk exceeds the remaining filesize) for a single file upload, leading to excessive resource consumption on the server.
- Storage exhaustion: By uploading chunks past the declared filesize, an attacker could potentially exhaust server storage by continuously uploading data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious client exploiting the chunked upload API by sending data beyond the declared file size
- By crafting specific requests that include multiple upload chunks which exceed the declared filesize, the attacker could cause a denial of service

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files using the chunked upload API.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and its parameters

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by improving the validation of chunked uploads, specifically by checking if the supplied offset plus the length of the chunk exceeds the declared filesize.
- Patches were created and applied to multiple branches of MediaWiki.
- The fix for this issue was released in MediaWiki versions 1.25.3, 1.24.4, and 1.23.11.
