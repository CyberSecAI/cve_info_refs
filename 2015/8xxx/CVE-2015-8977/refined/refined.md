Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the potential for Full Path Disclosure (FPD) through publicly accessible error log files. This means that the server's file system paths could be revealed in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive file system paths. Error logs can sometimes include the full path of the script that generated the error or related files and this information can then be accessed by an attacker.
- **Public Accessibility:** The error log files were publicly accessible, which should not be the case.
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Gathering:** An attacker could gather sensitive information about the server's file system structure. This information can be useful to plan further attacks such as to locate sensitive configuration files or to find other vulnerable entry points.
- **System Reconnaissance:**  Knowing the exact paths of files on the server makes it easier to find exploitable code, if it exists.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** An attacker would need to directly access the publicly exposed error log files, typically via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable MyBB forum.
- **Public Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the publicly accessible error log files
- **No authentication:** The attack can be carried out without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability was fixed in MyBB version 1.8.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low Risk," which implies a relatively low severity due to the limited scope of the impact but the vulnerability should be addressed.
- The vulnerability was reported by Devilshakerz.
- The full path disclosure vulnerability can help attackers in combination with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and to locate sensitive files or to launch more specific attacks.
