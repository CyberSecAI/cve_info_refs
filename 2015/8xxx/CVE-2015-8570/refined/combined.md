| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows domain users to reset arbitrary account passwords on vulnerable installations of Lepide Active Directory Self Service. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within processing of the password reset functionality of Active Directory Self Service.

A malicious user can use this to appropriate the account of a Domain Administrator. |
