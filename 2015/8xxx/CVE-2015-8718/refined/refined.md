Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the NLM (Network Lock Manager) dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The NLM dissector has a flaw that can cause a crash. This suggests a parsing error or an issue in how the dissector handles malformed or unexpected NLM packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject a specifically crafted, malformed NLM packet onto the network.
- **Malformed Capture File:** An attacker could convince a user to open a malformed packet capture file that contains a malicious NLM packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto a network being analyzed by Wireshark.
- Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to provide a user with a malicious packet capture file.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The NLM dissector in Wireshark versions 2.0.0, 1.12.0 to 1.12.8 is vulnerable to a crash due to a flaw in how it handles malformed packets. An attacker could exploit this by injecting a malformed packet onto the network being captured, or by providing a capture file containing a malicious NLM packet. This can lead to a denial-of-service.
