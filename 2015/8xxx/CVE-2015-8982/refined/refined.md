Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8982:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `strxfrm` function in glibc has two vulnerabilities related to memory allocation.

1.  **Integer Overflow:** When calculating the memory needed for allocation, an integer overflow can occur due to the multiplication of `(srclen + 1)` by `(sizeof (int32_t) + 1)`. This can lead to a smaller-than-required memory allocation.
2.  **Unbounded `alloca`:**  If memory allocation with `malloc` fails, `strxfrm` falls back to using `alloca` without any bounds check, potentially causing a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer overflow during memory allocation calculation.
*   Unbounded `alloca` usage if `malloc` fails leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** Can lead to heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient memory allocated by malloc, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Unbounded alloca**: Can cause a stack-based buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service through program crashes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities can be triggered by providing a string to the `strxfrm` function that results in the described conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the input string being passed to `strxfrm` function and have it processed by vulnerable glibc version.
*   The attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities locally if an application uses vulnerable version of glibc.
*   The integer overflow requires 32 bit systems.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in glibc 2.21.
*   The vulnerable code has been present since at least glibc 2.3.
*   The `strxfrm` function is used for transforming a string based on locale-specific collation rules.
*   The fix involved factoring out the old main loop to use a non-caching path when caching fails. Also `strxfrm_l` will allocate a fixed size array on the stack and use non-caching path if the fixed size array is not sufficient.
