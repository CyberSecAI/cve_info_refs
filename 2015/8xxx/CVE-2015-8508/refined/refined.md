Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-8508:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unfiltered HTML injection during the generation of dependency graphs in Bugzilla. Specifically, when a local 'dot' installation is used to generate the dependency graph, the HTML image map code is created locally. If a bug summary contains HTML escaped characters, it is possible to inject unfiltered HTML code into the map file. The `CreateImagemap` function then processes this unfiltered input, which leads to the XSS vulnerability.
* The issue arises because the bug summary is escaped too late in the process. The DOT program interprets `&#10;` as a newline character, splitting the bug summary into multiple lines in the .map file. Each line in the .map file is treated as a new command by DOT. By injecting a `<script>` tag, the attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute within the context of the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. Malicious HTML and JavaScript can be injected via bug summaries and then executed in the user's browser when viewing dependency graphs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a Bugzilla user's browser session. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft.
    *   Defacement of the Bugzilla interface.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious sites.
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Data theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious bug summary with HTML escaped characters, specifically a newline character (`&#10;`) and a `<script>` tag, which will then be executed when a dependency graph is generated.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating to the dependency graph of a bug with a crafted summary via `showdependencygraph.cgi`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify bug summaries within the Bugzilla system.
*   The Bugzilla instance must be configured to use a local 'dot' installation for dependency graph generation.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in to view dependency graphs.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Bugzilla versions 2.6 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1.
*   The fix is included in Bugzilla versions 4.2.16, 4.4.11, and 5.0.2.
*   Patches are available for older versions.
* The bug was reported by Holger Fuhrmannek and fixed by Frédéric Buclin, Dylan William Hardison, David Lawrence, and Gervase Markham.
* The security advisory indicates that this vulnerability is related to unfiltered HTML injection, and a similar vulnerability (CVE-2015-8509) is related to an information leak via CSV files.
