Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# Security advisory for Bugzilla 5.0.2, 4.4.11 and 4.2.16

---

*From*: LpSolit () gmail com

*Date*: Tue, 22 Dec 2015 21:50:04 GMT

```
Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Unfiltered HTML injected into a dependency graph could be used to
  create a cross-site scripting attack.

* Some web browsers incorrectly parse CSV files as valid JavaScript
  code which could lead to data leak.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.6 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: During the generation of a dependency graph, the code for
             the HTML image map is generated locally if a local dot
             installation is used. With escaped HTML characters in a bug
             summary, it is possible to inject unfiltered HTML code in
             the map file which the CreateImagemap function generates.
             This could be used for a cross-site scripting attack.
References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1221518>
CVE Number:  CVE-2015-8508

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.17.1 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: If an external HTML page contains a <script> element with
             its src attribute pointing to a buglist in CSV format, some
             web browsers incorrectly try to parse the CSV file as valid
             JavaScript code. As the buglist is generated based on the
             privileges of the user logged into Bugzilla, the external
             page could collect confidential data contained in the CSV
             file.
References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232785>
CVE Number:  CVE-2015-8509

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fixes for these issues are included in the 4.2.16, 4.4.11 and 5.0.2
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fixes will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerabilities, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL for each vulnerability.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

  <https://www.bugzilla.org/download/>

assistance in locating, advising us of, and assisting us to fix these
issues:

|  | |

During the generation of a dependency graph also the code for the html image map is generated if a local dot installation is used.
With html escaped characters in a bug summary it is possible to inject custom lines in the \*.map file with which the CreateImagemap function generates html code without filtering.
poc:
- configure bugzilla to use a local dot installation to generate a dependency graph
- create a bug with the following summary: &#10;default "><script>alert(1)</script> G
- visit /showdependencygraph.cgi?id=<BUG-ID>&showsummary=on&display=tree&rankdir=TB, a javascript alert prompt will show up

Attached patch

[patch for 5.0 and master, v1](attachment.cgi?id=8683094&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8683094&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1221518&attachment=8683094)

The bug summary is escaped too late in the process, and DOT interprets &#10; as a newline character, which means that the bug summary is split into several lines in the .map file. The problem is that each line in a .map file is a new command and is executed by DOT. In this case, it was asked to print <script>...</script> into the HTML page, triggering XSS.Assignee: dependency.views → LpSolitStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Ah no, that is the correct one. :) I have one with some other minor improvements, but it shouldn't be part of a security patch.

There have been no checkins on the 4.2 branch since 4.2.15. So there are no other pending checkins waiting to be released. I'm fine either way.

Backport for the 4.4 branch. It's the same code. Only a few context lines changed compared to master, which is why the patch for master didn't apply cleanly.

to try to get a better handle on the bounty award amount can someone comment on how often this configuration set up might be expected or appears in installations as default?
is it used on b.m.o as in a dependency graph like
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org//showdependencygraph.cgi?id=1229721&showsummary=on&display=tree&rankdir=TB>
so the only necessary step is to create a bug with the crafted summary and get it included in the dependency tree?

Yes. The dependency tree feature is a builtin feature of Bugzilla. It's always enabled. And no need to be logged in to view such as tree.

# 5.0.1, 4.4.10, and 4.2.15 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Dec 22nd, 2015
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Unfiltered HTML injected into a dependency graph could be used to
  create a cross-site scripting attack.

* Some web browsers incorrectly parse CSV files as valid JavaScript
  code which could lead to data leak.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    Bugzilla 2.6 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: During the generation of a dependency graph, the code for
             the HTML image map is generated locally if a local dot
             installation is used. With escaped HTML characters in a bug
             summary, it is possible to inject unfiltered HTML code in
             the map file which the CreateImagemap function generates.
             This could be used for a cross-site scripting attack.

CVE Number:  CVE-2015-8508

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    Bugzilla 2.17.1 to 4.2.15, 4.3.1 to 4.4.10, 4.5.1 to 5.0.1
Fixed In:    4.2.16, 4.4.11, 5.0.2
Description: If an external HTML page contains a <script> element with
             its src attribute pointing to a buglist in CSV format, some
             web browsers incorrectly try to parse the CSV file as valid
             JavaScript code. As the buglist is generated based on the
             privileges of the user logged into Bugzilla, the external
             page could collect confidential data contained in the CSV
             file.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
