# Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in Help system affects multiple IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technology (CVE-2015-0113)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

An undisclosed vulnerability in the help system affects the following IBM Jazz based Applications: Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM), Rational Requirements Composer (RRC), Rational DOORS Next Generation (RDNG), Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM), Rational Team Concert (RTC), Rational Quality Manager (RQM), Rational Rhapsody Design Manager (Rhapsody DM), and Rational Software Architect (RSA DM).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-0113](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0113) IBM Jazz help system could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. By sending a specially-crafted request to a jsp file, an attacker could disclose the source code of that file.

CVSS Base Score: 5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99848> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

## Remediation/Fixes

To correct this problem, you must replace the installed help archive file, clmhelp.war, with the latest version of this file. The procedure for doing this varies depending on whether you use remote help or local help.

With remote help, which is the default option, you deploy a small help archive file, which contains the help system infrastructure. Most of the help content resides in an external IBM Knowledge Center at ibm.com. The locally installed help system pulls the content from the IBM Knowledge Center. If you use the remote help option, download the clmhelp.war file from <http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/documentation/updatesites/CLM4.0.7-in-product> or <http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/documentation/updatesites/CLM5.0.2-in-product>. Follow the installation instructions at <https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/DocInstallAllHelp>.

With local help, you deploy a much larger help archive file, which includes all of the help content. Rather than pull content from the IBM Knowledge Center, the help system uses the content in the locally installed help archive file. If you use the local help option and are able to use the Local Help Updater utility, see [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC\_5.0.2/com.ibm.help.common.rational.remote.web.doc/topics/t\_download\_help\_web.html](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.2/com.ibm.help.common.rational.remote.web.doc/topics/t_download_help_web.html).

If you use the local help option but are unable to use the Local Help Updater, download the clmhelp.war file from <http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/documentation/updatesites/CLM4.0.7-all> or <http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/rationalsdp/documentation/updatesites/CLM5.0.2-all>. Follow the installation instructions at <https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/DocInstallAllHelp>.
