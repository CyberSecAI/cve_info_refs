Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0233:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of predictable temporary file names in two locations within the 389-admin package.
    *   In `AdminServer.pm.in`, the code creates a temporary directory using `/tmp/adm-sec-files.$$`.
    *   In `httpcon.c`, when debug tracing is enabled, a temporary file is created using `/tmp/http_trace.%d`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The use of `$$` (process ID) and `%d` in the temporary file paths makes the filenames predictable. This allows an attacker to potentially predict and overwrite files.
*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The code does not use secure temporary file creation methods like `mkstemp()`, which would generate unique and random file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is only locally exploitable.
*   **Administrative Action Required:** Exploitation requires administrative action, implying that an attacker would need to have some level of access to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **Potential for File Overwriting:**  An attacker could potentially overwrite files if they can predict the temporary file names before they are created by the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need to be able to execute code on the system where the vulnerable 389-admin is installed.
*   **Administrative Interaction:** The attacker needs to trigger some administrative action to cause the vulnerable code to execute and create the predictable temporary files/directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Limited Privileges:** It does not appear that root/admin privileges are required to trigger the creation of these predictable files, but administrative level interaction to trigger the code is required..

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `AdminServer.pm.in` issue was introduced in a specific bug fix for RHDS10.0 which was not released.
*   The `httpcon.c` issue is part of debug code and is not compiled by default.
* The Red Hat bug report indicates that the issue was addressed by not including the vulnerable code in released versions of the product.
