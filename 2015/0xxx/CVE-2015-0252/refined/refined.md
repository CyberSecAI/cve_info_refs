  "CVE-2015-0252": {
    "description": "internal/XMLReader.cpp in Apache Xerces-C before 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and crash) via crafted XML data.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the mishandling of malformed XML input documents by the Xerces-C XML parser.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The primary weakness is a buffer overflow in the XMLReader component when processing malformed XML data.",
        "There might be insufficient input sanitization or validation in XML parsing functions."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted XML document, leading to segmentation fault and crash of the application that utilizes the vulnerable Xerces-C library.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector is through network communication by sending malformed XML data to applications that use the vulnerable Xerces-C library.",
        "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability, and does not require user interaction."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send XML documents over the network. No special authentication is required. No user interaction is required.",
