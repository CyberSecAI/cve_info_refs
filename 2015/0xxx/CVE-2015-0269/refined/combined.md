### SECURITY.md

# Security policy

Security is a top priority for Contao. Please help us make the system more
secure!

## Reporting a security issue

If you think that you have found a security issue in Contao, please write an
e-mail to **security [at] contao.org**. E-mails sent to this address are
forwarded to a private channel of the Contao core team.

Never disclose any information about a vulnerability in the public web (blog
posts, tweets, GitHub issues, etc.) before the vulnerability has been
acknowledged and fixed in a new Contao release!

## Resolving process

For each report, we first try to confirm the vulnerability. When it is
confirmed, the core team works on a solution following these steps:

1. Send an acknowledgement to the reporter;
2. Work on a patch;
3. Get a CVE identifier from mitre.org;
4. Publish a security announcement on contao.org;
5. Send the patch to the reporter for review;
6. Apply the patch to all maintained versions of Contao;
7. Release new versions for all affected versions;
8. Announce the new versions and the vulnerability on contao.org;
9. Update the public [security advisories database](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories).

## Bug bounty

The [Contao Association](https://association.contao.org) rewards reporters of confirmed vulnerabilities with
a security bounty of 100 Euros.

## Security advisories

Check the [security advisories database](https://contao.org/en/security-advisories.html) for a list of all security
vulnerabilities that were already found and fixed in Contao.
