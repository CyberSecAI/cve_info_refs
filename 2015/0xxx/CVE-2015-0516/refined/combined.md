## Introduction

[EMC M&R](http://www.emc.com/data-center-management/watch4net.htm) (formerly known as Watch4net) enables cross-domain performance monitoring of infrastructure and data center components in real-time - from a single, customizable dashboard.

A path traversal vulnerability was found in M&R (Watch4net) MIB Browser. Path traversal vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is used insecurely within a file system operation. Typically, a user-supplied filename is appended to a directory prefix in order to read or write the contents of a file.

## Details

This vulnerability can be trigger via de *name* URL parameter of the `/mib-browser/mibs/download` page. An authenticated attacker can supply path traversal sequences to break out of the intended download directory and read files elsewhere on the file system. This allows the attacker to access sensitive files containing configuration data, passwords, database records, log data, source code, and program scripts and binaries.

The following URLs can be used to demonstrate this issue:

[http://:58080/mib-browser/mibs/download?name=........\Web-Servers\Tomcat\Default\conf\server.xml](http://%3Ctarget%3E:58080/mib-browser/mibs/download?name=........%5CWeb-Servers%5CTomcat%5CDefault%5Cconf%5Cserver.xml)
[http://:58080/mib-browser/mibs/download?name=................................\windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts](http://%3Ctarget%3E:58080/mib-browser/mibs/download?name=................................%5Cwindows%5CSystem32%5Cdrivers%5Cetc%5Chosts)
