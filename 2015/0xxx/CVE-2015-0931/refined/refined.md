The provided content relates to CVE-2015-0931.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improperly configured XML parser within the Ektron CMS. While Ektron uses a secure Microsoft XML parser by default, an attacker can force the system to use the vulnerable Saxon XSLT parser which allows for resource injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection') vulnerability (CWE-99)
- The vulnerability lies in the system's use of a vulnerable XSLT parser if configured to use the Saxon parser instead of the default Microsoft parser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privilege level of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted XSLT document to the server while forcing the use of the vulnerable Saxon XSLT parser, an attacker can inject malicious resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted XSLT document to the server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to force the system to use the Saxon parser instead of the default Microsoft parser.
