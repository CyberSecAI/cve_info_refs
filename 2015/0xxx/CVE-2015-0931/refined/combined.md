## Ektron Content Management System (CMS) contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#377644

Original Release Date: 2015-02-05 | Last Revised: 2015-02-10

---

### Overview

Ektron Content Management System (CMS) versions 8.5, 8.7, and 9.0 contain a XXE and a resource injection vulnerability.

### Description

| **Note:** A prior version of this report indicated incorrectly that Ektron CMS version 9.1 was vulnerable. The vendor indicated that the last version to ship with this vulnerability was version 9.0.  [**CWE-611**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') -** CVE-2015-0923Ektron Content Management System version 8.5, 8.7, and 9.0 contain a XXE vulnerability in /Workarea/ServerControlWS.asmx.  The parameter xslt of the method ContentBlockEx allows a remote unauthenticated user to read arbitrary files.[**CWE-99**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/99.html)**: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')** **-** CVE-2015-0931Ektron Content Management System version 8.5, 8.7, and 9.0 contain a resource injection vulnerability by using an improperly configured XML parser. By default, Ektron utilizes the Microsoft XML parser to parse XSLT documents, which is not vulnerable. If an attacker specifies use of the Saxon XSLT parser instead, and sends it a specially crafted XSLT document, the attacker may be able to run arbitrary code at the privilege level of the application.The CVSS score reflects CVE-2015-0923. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated user may be able to read arbitrary files on the server. In the case of the resource injection vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to run arbitrary code on the server at the privilege level of the application. |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**The vendor Ektron reported that both of these issues were fixed in the October 2013 update. In particular, Ektron states:*"**This was patched via a cumulative security patcher that was made available Oct 9, 2013 that would apply the updates to versions 8.0.2 to 9.0. The current version of the patcher is available at:* *<https://portal.ektron.com/News/Security/Security_Notice_-_11-25-14/>**8.7sp2 (released 8/16/2013), 9.0sp1 (released 8/19/2013), and 9.1 (released 8/28/2014) were all released with the fix in place. Subsequent service packs also contain the fixes for those versions."*The vendor recommends users go to their [support](https://portal.ektron.com/Downloads/) site to obtain the latest update. |
