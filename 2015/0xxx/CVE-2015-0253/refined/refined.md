Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-0253:

**Root Cause:**
- A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the Apache HTTP Server when handling `ErrorDocument 400` directives that point to a local URL-path. This occurs when the `INCLUDES` filter is active, and a request lacking a method is received.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs because the server does not properly initialize the protocol structure member when handling an error condition, and then tries to use it.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The code does not handle the error condition correctly when a request without a method is received while an `ErrorDocument 400` with a local URI is used, especially when the `INCLUDES` filter is active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a request lacking a method to an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter and has an ErrorDocument 400 directive specifying a local URI, leading to a process crash.
- The service availability is impacted and causes a server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via HTTP requests.
- **Specific Request:** The attack requires sending a specially crafted request lacking a method to an affected server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user who can send HTTP requests to the server.
- **Knowledge of Server Configuration:** The attacker must be aware of specific configurations, like the use of `ErrorDocument 400` pointing to a local URL-path when the `INCLUDES` filter is active.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `read_request_line` function in `server/protocol.c`.
- This vulnerability was introduced in version 2.4.11 and was fixed in 2.4.16.
- Some configurations might be more vulnerable than others. This could lead to other issues such as information disclosure and script execution.

**Summary of provided information:**
- The Apple support document confirms that this CVE is addressed by updating Apache to version 2.4.16 in OS X Server v5.0.3.
- The Red Hat Security Advisory indicates a fix in `httpd24-httpd-2.4.12-6.el7.1` and `httpd24-httpd-2.4.12-4.el6.2`, resolving multiple issues including this one.
- The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists CVE-2015-0253 as a moderate risk vulnerability.
- The Apache bugzilla entry provides additional details on the root cause, and identifies that the fix is present in version 2.4.13 and later. The code fix involves skipping the usual protocol setup when handling this error case in server/protocol.c
