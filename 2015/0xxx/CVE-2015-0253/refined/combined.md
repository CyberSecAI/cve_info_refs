## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd24-httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1666)

## Topic

Updated httpd24-httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
and extensible web server.

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would decode
differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it, possibly leading to
HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)

It was discovered that in httpd 2.4, the internal API function
ap\_some\_auth\_required() could incorrectly indicate that a request was
authenticated even when no authentication was used. An httpd module using
this API function could consequently allow access that should have been
denied. (CVE-2015-3185)

Note: This update introduces new a new API function,
ap\_some\_authn\_required(), which correctly indicates if a request is
authenticated. External httpd modules using the old API function should be
modified to use the new one to completely resolve this issue.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the mod\_lua httpd module
processed certain WebSocket Ping requests. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted WebSocket Ping packet that would cause the httpd child
process to crash. (CVE-2015-0228)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way httpd generated
certain error responses. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
crash the httpd child process using a request that triggers a certain HTTP
error. (CVE-2015-0253)

All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
the updated packages, the httpd24-httpd service will be restarted
automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

Changes with Apache 2.4.63
\*) mod\_dav: Update redirect-carefully example BrowserMatch config
to match more recent client versions. PR 66148, 67039.
[Michal Maloszewski ,
Romain Tartière ]
\*) mod\_cache\_socache: Fix possible crash on error path. PR 69358.
[Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_ssl: Fail cleanly at startup if OpenSSL initialization fails.
[StephenWall]
\*) mod\_md: update to version 2.4.31
- Improved error reporting when waiting for ACME server to verify domains
or finalizing the order fails, e.g. times out.
- Increasing the timeouts to wait for ACME server to verify domain names
and issue the certificate from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.
- Change a log level from error to debug when Stapling is enabled but a
certificate carries no OCSP responder URL.
\*) mod\_proxy\_balancer: Fix the handling of the stickysession configuration
parameter by the balancer manager. PR 69510
[Yutaka Tokunou ]
\*) Add the ldap-search option to mod\_authnz\_ldap, allowing authorization
to be based on arbitrary expressions that do not include the username.
Make sure that when ldap searches are too long, we explicitly log the
error. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_proxy: Honor parameters of ProxyPassMatch workers with substitution
in the host name or port. PR 69233. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_log\_config: Fix merging for the "LogFormat" directive.
PR 65222. [Michael Kaufmann ]
\*) mod\_lua: Make r.ap\_auth\_type writable. PR 62497.
[Michael Osipov ]
\*) mod\_md: update to version 2.4.29
- Fixed HTTP-01 challenges to not carry a final newline, as some ACME
server fail to ignore it. [Michael Kaufmann (@mkauf)]
- Fixed missing label+newline in server-status plain text output when
MDStapling is enabled.
\*) mod\_ssl: Restore support for loading PKCS#11 keys via ENGINE
without "SSLCryptoDevice" configured. [Joe Orton]
\*) mod\_authnz\_ldap: Fix possible memory corruption if the
AuthLDAPSubGroupAttribute directive is configured. [Joe Orton]
\*) mod\_proxy\_fcgi: Don't re-encode SCRIPT\_FILENAME when set via SetHandler.
PR 69203. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_rewrite, mod\_proxy: mod\_proxy to canonicalize rewritten [P] URLs,
including "unix:" ones. PR 69235, PR 69260. [Yann Ylavic, Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Error out in case a RewriteRule in directory context uses the
proxy, but mod\_proxy is not loaded. PR 56264.
[Christophe Jaillet, Michael Streeter ]
\*) http: Remove support for Request-Range header sent by Navigator 2-3 and
MSIE 3. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Don't require [UNC] flag to preserve a leading //
added by applying the perdir prefix to the substitution.
[Ruediger Pluem, Eric Covener]
\*) Windows: Restore the ability to "Include" configuration files on UNC
paths. PR 69313 [Eric Covener]
\*) mod\_proxy: Avoid AH01059 parsing error for SetHandler "unix:" URLs
in  (incomplete fix in 2.4.62). PR 69160. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_md: update to version 2.4.28
- When the server starts, it looks for new, staged certificates to
activate. If the staged set of files in 'md/staging/' is messed
up, this could prevent further renewals to happen. Now, when the staging
set is present, but could not be activated due to an error, purge the
whole directory. [icing]
- Fix certificate retrieval on ACME renewal to not require a 'Location:'
header returned by the ACME CA. This was the way it was done in ACME
before it became an IETF standard. Let's Encrypt still supports this,
but other CAs do not. [icing]
- Restore compatibility with OpenSSL < 1.1. [ylavic]
\*) mod\_tls: removed the experimental module. It now is availble standalone
from https://github.com/icing/mod\_tls. The rustls provided API is not
stable and does not align with the httpd release cycle.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Better question mark tracking to avoid UnsafeAllow3F.
PR 69197. [Yann Ylavic, Eric Covener]
\*) mod\_http2: Return connection monitoring to the event MPM when blocking
on client updates. [Stefan Eissing, Yann Ylavic]
Changes with Apache 2.4.62
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-40898: Apache HTTP Server: SSRF with
mod\_rewrite in server/vhost context on Windows (cve.mitre.org)
SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod\_rewrite in
server/vhost context, allows to potentially leak NTML hashes to
a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62 which fixes
this issue.
Credits: Smi1e (DBAPPSecurity Ltd.)
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-40725: Apache HTTP Server: source code
disclosure with handlers configured via AddType (cve.mitre.org)
A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP
Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based
configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration,
under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly,
result in source code disclosure of local content. For example,
PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes
this issue.
\*) mod\_proxy: Fix canonicalisation and FCGI env (PATH\_INFO, SCRIPT\_NAME) for
"balancer:" URLs set via SetHandler, also allowing for "unix:" sockets
with BalancerMember(s). PR 69168. [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_proxy: Avoid AH01059 parsing error for SetHandler "unix:" URLs.
PR 69160 [Yann Ylavic]
\*) mod\_ssl: Fix crashes in PKCS#11 ENGINE support with OpenSSL 3.2.
[Joe Orton]
\*) mod\_ssl: Add support for loading certs/keys from pkcs11: URIs
via OpenSSL 3.x providers. [Ingo Franzki ]
\*) mod\_ssl: Restore SSL dumping on trace7 loglevel with OpenSSL >= 3.0.
[Ruediger Pluem, Yann Ylavic]
\*) mpm\_worker: Fix possible warning (AH00045) about children processes not
terminating timely. [Yann Ylavic]
Changes with Apache 2.4.61
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-39884: Apache HTTP Server: source code
disclosure with handlers configured via AddType (cve.mitre.org)
A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores
some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of
handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some
circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in
source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP
scripts may be served instead of interpreted.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.61, which fixes
this issue.
Changes with Apache 2.4.60
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-39573: Apache HTTP Server: mod\_rewrite proxy
handler substitution (cve.mitre.org)
Potential SSRF in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
earlier allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to
unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by mod\_proxy.
Credits: Orange Tsai (@orange\_8361) from DEVCORE
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38477: Apache HTTP Server: Crash resulting in
Denial of Service in mod\_proxy via a malicious request
(cve.mitre.org)
null pointer dereference in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to crash the server via a
malicious request.
Credits: Orange Tsai (@orange\_8361) from DEVCORE
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38476: Apache HTTP Server may use
exploitable/malicious backend application output to run local
handlers via internal redirect (cve.mitre.org)
Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier
are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script
execution via backend applications whose response headers are
malicious or exploitable.
Note: Some legacy uses of the 'AddType' directive to connect a
request to a handler must be ported to 'AddHandler' after this fix.
Credits: Orange Tsai (@orange\_8361) from DEVCORE
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38475: Apache HTTP Server weakness in
mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches
filesystem path. (cve.mitre.org)
Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem
locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are
not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in
code execution or source code disclosure.
Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or
variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.
Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the
rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once
ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.
Credits: Orange Tsai (@orange\_8361) from DEVCORE
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38474: Apache HTTP Server weakness with
encoded question marks in backreferences (cve.mitre.org)
Substitution encoding issue in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in
directories permitted by the configuration but not directly
reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to
only to be executed as CGI.
Note: Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now
fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.
Credits: Orange Tsai (@orange\_8361) from DEVCORE
\*) SECURITY: CVE-2024-38473: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding
problem (cve.mitre.org)
Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and
earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent
to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via

\*) SECURITY: CVE-2023-45802: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream
memory not reclaimed right away on RST (cve.mitre.org)
When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there
was a time window were the request's memory resources were not
reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to
connection close. A client could send new requests and resets,
keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory
footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources
were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before
that.
This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487
(HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During
"normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very
low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the
connection closes or times out.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes
the issue.

- New directive 'H2EarlyHint name value' to add headers to a response,
picked up already when a "103 Early Hints" response is sent. 'name' and
'value' must comply to the HTTP field restrictions.
This directive can be repeated several times and header fields of the
same names add. Sending a 'Link' header with 'preload' relation will
also cause a HTTP/2 PUSH if enabled and supported by the client.
- Fixed an issue where requests were not logged and accounted in a timely
fashion when the connection returns to "keepalive" handling, e.g. when
the request served was the last outstanding one.
This led to late appearance in access logs with wrong duration times
reported.
- Accurately report the bytes sent for a request in the '%O' Log format.
This addresses #203, a long outstanding issue where mod\_h2 has reported
numbers over-eagerly from internal buffering and not what has actually
been placed on the connection.
The numbers are now the same with and without H2CopyFiles enabled.

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with
some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific
pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL)
data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target
using variable substitution. For example, something like:
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

- an APR pollset and pipes (where supported) are used to monitor
the main connection and react to IO for request/response handling.
This replaces the stuttered timed waits of earlier versions.
- H2SerializeHeaders directive still exists, but has no longer an effect.
- Clients that seemingly misbehave still get less resources allocated,
but ongoing requests are no longer disrupted.
- Fixed an issue since 1.15.24 that "Server" headers in proxied requests
were overwritten instead of preserved. [PR by @daum3ns]
- A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd child
processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or when reaching
MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2 requests were queued at
the time, these could stall. See #212.
- Improved information displayed in 'server-status' for H2 connections when
Extended Status is enabled. Now one can see the last request that IO
operations happened on and transferred IO stats are updated as well.
- When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the HTTP/2 connection
send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new connections, leading to invalid
protocol state and a client failing the request. See PR65731 at
.
The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and allows the
client to submit one request before the shutdown via a GOAWAY frame
is being announced.
- :scheme pseudo-header values, not matching the
connection scheme, are forwarded via absolute uris to the
http protocol processing to preserve semantics of the request.
Checks on combinations of pseudo-headers values/absence
have been added as described in RFC 7540. Fixes #230.
- A bug that prevented trailers (e.g. HEADER frame at the end) to be
generated in certain cases was fixed. See #233 where it prevented
gRPC responses to be properly generated.
- Request and response header values are automatically stripped of leading
and trialing space/tab characters. This is equivalent behaviour to what
Apache httpd's http/1.1 parser does.
The checks for this in nghttp2 v1.50.0+ are disabled.
- Extensive testing in production done by Alessandro Bianchi (@alexskynet)
on the v2.0.x versions for stability. Many thanks!

- Added support for ACME External Account Binding (EAB).
Use the new directive `MDExternalAccountBinding` to provide the

your CA.
While working on some servers, EAB handling is not uniform
across CAs. First tests with a Sectigo Certificate Manager in
demo mode are successful. But ZeroSSL, for example, seems to
regard EAB values as a one-time-use-only thing, which makes them
fail if you create a seconde account or retry the creation of the
first account with the same EAB.
- The directive 'MDCertificateAuthority' now checks if its parameter
is a http/https url or one of a set of known names. Those are
'LetsEncrypt', 'LetsEncrypt-Test', 'Buypass' and 'Buypass-Test'
for now and they are not case-sensitive.
The default of LetsEncrypt is unchanged.
- `MDContactEmail` can now be specified inside a ``
section.
- Treating 401 HTTP status codes for orders like 403, since some ACME
servers seem to prefer that for accessing oders from other accounts.
- When retrieving certificate chains, try to read the response even
if the HTTP Content-Type is unrecognized.
- Fixed a bug that reset the error counter of a certificate renewal
and prevented the increasing delays in further attempts.
- Fixed the renewal process giving up every time on an already existing
order with some invalid domains. Now, if such are seen in a previous
order, a new order is created for a clean start over again.

- Fixed a mixup in md-status handler when static certificate files

\*) core: Adding SSL related inquiry functions to the server API.
These function are always available, even when no module providing
SSL is loaded. They provide their own "shadowing" implementation for
the optional functions of similar name that mod\_ssl and impersonators
of mod\_ssl provide.
This enables loading of several SSL providing modules when all but
one of them registers itself into the new hooks. Two old-style SSL
modules will not work, as they replace the others optional functions
with their own.
Modules using the old-style optional functions will continue to work
as core supplies its own versions of those.
The following has been added so far:
- ap\_ssl\_conn\_is\_ssl() to query if a connection is using SSL.
- ap\_ssl\_var\_lookup() to query SSL related variables for a
server/connection/request.
- Hooks for 'ssl\_conn\_is\_ssl' and 'ssl\_var\_lookup' where modules
providing SSL can install their own value supplying functions.
- ap\_ssl\_add\_cert\_files() to enable other modules like mod\_md to provide
certificate and keys for an SSL module like mod\_ssl.
- ap\_ssl\_add\_fallback\_cert\_files() to enable other modules like mod\_md to
provide a fallback certificate in case no 'proper' certificate is
available for an SSL module like mod\_ssl.
- ap\_ssl\_answer\_challenge() to enable other modules like mod\_md to
provide a certificate as used in the RFC 8555 'tls-alpn-01' challenge
for the ACME protocol for an SSL module like mod\_ssl. The function
and its hook provide PEM encoded data instead of file names.
- Hooks for 'ssl\_add\_cert\_files', 'ssl\_add\_fallback\_cert\_files' and
'ssl\_answer\_challenge' where modules like mod\_md can provide providers
to the above mentioned functions.
- These functions reside in the new 'http\_ssl.h' header file.
[Stefan Eissing]
\*) core/mod\_ssl/mod\_md: adding OCSP response provisioning as core feature. This
allows modules to access and provide OCSP response data without being tied
of each other. The data is exchanged in standard, portable formats (PEM encoded
certificates and DER encoded responses), so that the actual SSL/crypto
implementations used by the modules are independant of each other.
Registration and retrieval happen in the context of a server (server\_rec)
which modules may use to decide if they are configured for this or not.
The area of changes:
1. core: defines 2 functions in include/http\_ssl.h, so that modules may
register a certificate, together with its issuer certificate for OCSP
response provisioning and ask for current response data (DER bytes) later.
Also, 2 hooks are defined that allow modules to implement this OCSP
provisioning.
2. mod\_ssl uses the new functions, in addition to what it did already, to
register its certificates this way. If no one is interested in providing
OCSP, it falls back to its own (if configured) stapling implementation.
3. mod\_md registers itself at the core hooks for OCSP provisioning. Depending
on configuration, it will accept registrations of its own certificates only,
all certificates or none.

\*) mod\_md: v2.4.0 with improvements and bugfixes
- MDPrivateKeys allows the specification of several types. Beside "RSA" plus
optional key lengths elliptic curves can be configured. This means you can
have multiple certificates for a Managed Domain with different key types.
With ```MDPrivateKeys secp384r1 rsa2048``` you get one ECDSA and one RSA
certificate and all modern client will use the shorter ECDSA, while older
client will get the RSA certificate.
Many thanks to @tlhackque who pushed and helped on this.
- Support added for MDomains consisting of a wildcard. Configuring
```MDomain \*.host.net``` will match all virtual hosts matching that pattern
and obtain one certificate for it (assuming you have 'dns-01' challenge
support configured). Addresses #239.
- Removed support for ACMEv1 servers. The only known installation used to
be Let's Encrypt which has disabled that version more than a year ago for
new accounts.
- Andreas Ulm () implemented the
```renewing``` call to ```MDMessageCmd``` that can deny a certificate
renewal attempt. This is useful in clustered installations, as
discussed in #233).
- New event ```challenge-setup::```, triggered when the
challenge data for a domain has been created. This is invoked before the
ACME server is told to check for it. The type is one of the ACME challenge
types. This is invoked for every DNS name in a MDomain.
- The max delay for retries has been raised to daily (this is like all
retries jittered somewhat to avoid repeats at fixed time of day).
- Certain error codes reported by the ACME server that indicate a problem
with the configured data now immediately switch to daily retries. For
example: if the ACME server rejects a contact email or a domain name,
frequent retries will most likely not solve the problem. But daily retries
still make sense as there might be an error at the server and un-supervised
certificate renewal is the goal. Refs #222.
- Test case and work around for domain names > 64 octets. Fixes #227.
When the first DNS name of an MD is longer than 63 octets, the certificate
request will not contain a CN field, but leave it up to the CA to choose one.
Currently, Lets Encrypt looks for a shorter name in the SAN list given and
fails the request if none is found. But it is really up to the CA (and what
browsers/libs accept here) and may change over the years. That is why
the decision is best made at the CA.
- Retry delays now have a random +/-[0-50]% modification applied to let
retries from several servers spread out more, should they have been
restarted at the same time of day.
- Fixed several places where the 'badNonce' return code from an ACME server
was not handled correctly. The test server 'pebble' simulates this behaviour
by default and helps nicely in verifying this behaviour. Thanks, pebble!
- Set the default `MDActivationDelay` to 0. This was confusing to users that
new certificates were deemed not usably before a day of delay. When clocks are
correct, using a new certificate right away should not pose a problem.
- When handling ACME authorization resources, the module no longer requires
the server to return a "Location" header, as was necessary in ACMEv1.
Fixes #216.
- Fixed a theoretical uninitialized read when testing for JSON error responses
from the ACME CA. Reported at .
- ACME problem reports from CAs that include parameters in the Content-Type
header are handled correctly. (Previously, the problem text would not be
reported and retries could exceed CA limits.)
- Account Update transactions to V2 CAs now use the correct POST-AS-GET method.
Previously, an empty JSON object was sent - which apparently LE accepted,
but others reject.

this module, and we should avoid confusion between the provider
of a backend (AuthnCacheSOCache) and the authn provider(s) for
which this module provides cacheing (AuthnCacheProvideFor).
[Nick Kew]
\*) mod\_proxy\_http: Allocate the fake backend request from a child pool
of the backend connection, instead of misusing the pool of the frontend

backend connection leak into other threads, and then disappear when
the frontend request is cleaned up, in turn causing corrupted buckets
to make other threads spin. [Graham Leggett]

'ssl-verify-client' (for use with 'SSLVerifyClient optional'), and
'ssl-require' (expressions with same syntax as SSLRequire).

bison instead of yacc. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) mod\_disk\_cache: Change on-disk header file format to support the

process is exiting. [Jeff Trawick]
\*) core: For process invocation (cgi, fcgid, piped loggers and so forth)
pass the system library path (LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH or platform-specific
variables) along with the system PATH, by default. Both should be
overridden together as desired using PassEnv etc; see mod\_env.
[William Rowe]
\*) mod\_cache: Introduce CacheStoreExpired, to allow administrators to
capture a stale backend response, perform If-Modified-Since requests
against the backend, and serving from the cache all 304 responses.
This restores pre-2.2.4 cache behavior. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_rewrite: Introduce <=, >= string comparison operators, and integer
comparators -lt, -le, -eq, -ge, and -gt. To help bash users and drop
the ambiguity of the symlink test "-ltest", introduce -h or -L as
symlink test operators. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_cache: Give the cache provider the opportunity to choose to cache
or not cache based on the buckets present in the brigade, such as the
presence of a FILE bucket.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_authz\_core: Allow authz providers to check args while reading the

providers from mod\_authz\_host to mod\_authz\_core. Add 'method' authz
provider depending on the HTTP method. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) mod\_include: Move the request\_rec within mod\_include to be
exposed within include\_ctx\_t. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_include: Reinstate support for UTF-8 character sets by allowing a
variable being echoed or set to be decoded and then encoded as separate
steps. PR47686 [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cache: Add a discrete commit\_entity() provider function within the
mod\_cache provider interface which is called to indicate to the
provider that caching is complete, giving the provider the opportunity
to commit temporary files permanently to the cache in an atomic
fashion. Replace the inconsistent use of error cleanups with a formal
set of pool cleanups attached to a subpool, which is destroyed on error.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cache: Change the signature of the store\_body() provider function
within the mod\_cache provider interface to support an "in" brigade
and an "out" brigade instead of just a single input brigade. This
gives a cache provider the option to consume only part of the brigade
passed to it, rather than the whole brigade as was required before.
This fixes an out of memory and a request timeout condition that would
occur when the original document was a large file. Introduce
CacheReadSize and CacheReadTime directives to mod\_disk\_cache to control
the amount of data to attempt to cache at a time. [Graham Leggett]
\*) core: Add ErrorLogFormat to allow configuring error log format, including
additional information that is logged once per connection or request. Add
error log IDs for connections and request to allow correlating error log
lines and the corresponding access log entry. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) core: Disable sendfile by default. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) mod\_cache: Check the request to determine whether we are allowed
to return cached content at all, and respect a "Cache-Control:
no-cache" header from a client. Previously, "no-cache" would
behave like "max-age=0". [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cache: Use a proper filter context to hold filter data instead
of misusing the per-request configuration. Fixes a segfault on trunk
when the normal handler is used. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_cgid: Log a warning if the ScriptSock path is truncated because
it is too long. PR 49388. [Stefan Fritsch]
\*) vhosts: Do not allow \_default\_ in NameVirtualHost, or mixing \*

directives for the same address:port, or NameVirtualHost
directives with no matching VirtualHosts, or multiple ip-based
VirtualHost sections for the same address:port. These were
previously accepted with a warning, but the behavior was
undefined. [Dan Poirier]

buckets stay exactly APR\_BUCKET\_BUFF\_SIZE long. [Graham Leggett,
Ruediger Pluem]

and to enable different virtualhosts to run with different
privileges and Unix user/group IDs [Nick Kew]

\*) mod\_auth\_form: Make sure that basic authentication is correctly
faked directly after login. [Graham Leggett]

within the output headers and error output headers, so that the
session is maintained across redirects. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_auth\_form: Make sure the logged in user is populated correctly
after a form login. Fixes a missing REMOTE\_USER variable directly
following a login. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_cookie: Make sure that cookie attributes are correctly
included in the blank cookie when cookies are removed. This fixes an
inability to log out when using mod\_auth\_form. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session: Prevent a segfault when a CGI script sets a cookie with a
null value. [David Shane Holden ]
\*) core, authn/z: Determine registered authn/z providers directly in
ap\_setup\_auth\_internal(), which allows optional functions that just
wrapped ap\_list\_provider\_names() to be removed from authn/z modules.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) authn/z: Convert common provider version strings to macros.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) core: When testing for slash-terminated configuration paths in
ap\_location\_walk(), don't look past the start of an empty string
such as that created by a  directive.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) core, mod\_proxy: If a kept\_body is present, it becomes safe for
subrequests to support message bodies. Make sure that safety
checks within the core and within the proxy are not triggered
when kept\_body is present. This makes it possible to embed
proxied POST requests within mod\_include. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_auth\_form: Make sure the input filter stack is properly set
up before reading the login form. Make sure the kept body filter
is correctly inserted to ensure the body can be read a second
time safely should the authn be successful. [Graham Leggett,
Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_request: Insert the KEPT\_BODY filter via the insert\_filter
hook instead of during fixups. Add a safety check to ensure the
filters cannot be inserted more than once. [Graham Leggett,
Ruediger Pluem]
\*) ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers\_out() will (now) always
merge an error headers \_before\_ clearing them and \_before\_
merging in the actual entity headers and doing normal
hop-by-hop cleansing. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) cache: retire ap\_cache\_cacheable\_hdrs\_out() which was used
for both in- and out-put headers; and replace it by a single
ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers() wrapped in a in- and out-put
specific ap\_cache\_cacheable\_headers\_in()/out(). The latter
which will also merge error and ensure content-type. To keep
cache modules consistent with ease. This API change bumps
up the minor MM by one [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) Move the KeptBodySize directive, kept\_body filters and the
ap\_parse\_request\_body function out of the http module and into a
new module called mod\_request, reducing the size of the core.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_dbd: Handle integer configuration directive parameters with a
dedicated function.
\*) Change the directives within the mod\_session\* modules to be valid
both inside and outside the location/directory sections, as
suggested by wrowe. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_auth\_form: Add a module capable of allowing end users to log
in using an HTML form, storing the credentials within mod\_session.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) Add a function to the http filters that is able to parse an HTML
form request with the type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_crypto: Initialise SSL in the post config hook.
[Ruediger Pluem, Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_dbd: Add a session implementation capable of storing
session information in a SQL database via the dbd interface. Useful
for sites where session privacy is important. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_crypto: Add a session encoding implementation capable
of encrypting and decrypting sessions wherever they may be stored.
Introduces a level of privacy when sessions are stored on the
browser. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session\_cookie: Add a session implementation capable of storing
session information within cookies on the browser. Useful for high
volume sites where server bound sessions are too resource intensive.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_session: Add a generic session interface to unify the different
attempts at saving persistent sessions across requests.
[Graham Leggett]
\*) core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
with configurations which match those of initial request. Revert to
original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration
which can accept additional mode and flag data. [Chris Darroch]
\*) Introduced ap\_expr API for expression evaluation.
This is adapted from mod\_include, which is the first module
to use the new API.
[Nick Kew]
\*) mod\_authz\_dbd: When redirecting after successful login/logout per
AuthzDBDRedirectQuery, do not report authorization failure, and use
first row returned by database query instead of last row.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) mod\_ldap: Correctly return all requested attribute values
when some attributes have a null value.
PR 44560 [Anders Kaseorg ]
\*) core: check symlink ownership if both FollowSymlinks and
SymlinksIfOwnerMatch are set [Nick Kew]
\*) core: fix origin checking in SymlinksIfOwnerMatch
PR 36783 [Robert L Mathews ]
\*) Activate mod\_cache, mod\_file\_cache and mod\_disk\_cache as part of the
'most' set for '--enable-modules' and '--enable-shared-mods'. Include
mod\_mem\_cache in 'all' as well. [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]
\*) Also install mod\_so.h, mod\_rewrite.h and mod\_cache.h; as these
contain public function declarations which are useful for
third party module authors. PR 42431 [Dirk-Willem van Gulik].
\*) mod\_dir, mod\_negotiation: pass the output filter information
to newly created sub requests; as these are later on used
as true requests with an internal redirect. This allows for
mod\_cache et.al. to trap the results of the redirect.
[Dirk-Willem van Gulik, Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_ldap: Add support (taking advantage of the new APR capability)
for ldap rebind callback while chasing referrals. This allows direct
searches on LDAP servers (in particular MS Active Directory 2003+)
using referrals without the use of the global catalog.
PRs 26538, 40268, and 42557 [Paul J. Reder]
\*) ApacheMonitor.exe: Introduce --kill argument for use by the
installer. This will permit the installation tool to remove
all running instances before attempting to remove the .exe.
[William Rowe]
\*) mod\_ssl: Add support for OCSP validation of client certificates.
PR 41123. [Marc Stern , Joe Orton]
\*) mod\_serf: New module for Reverse Proxying. [Paul Querna]
\*) core: Add the option to keep aside a request body up to a certain
size that would otherwise be discarded, to be consumed by filters
such as mod\_include. When enabled for a directory, POST requests
to shtml files can be passed through to embedded scripts as POST
requests, rather being downgraded to GET requests. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_ssl: Fix TLS upgrade (RFC 2817) support. PR 41231. [Joe Orton]
\*) scoreboard: Correctly declare ap\_time\_process\_request.
PR 43789 [Tom Donovan ]
\*) core; scoreboard: ap\_get\_scoreboard\_worker(sbh) now takes the sbh member
from the connection rec, ap\_get\_scoreboard\_worker(proc, thread) will now
provide the unusual legacy lookup. [William Rowe]
\*) mpm winnt: fix null pointer dereference
PR 42572 [Davi Arnaut]
\*) mod\_authnz\_ldap, mod\_authn\_dbd: Tidy up the code to expose authn
parameters to the environment. Improve portability to
EBCDIC machines by using apr\_toupper(). [Martin Kraemer]
\*) mod\_ldap, mod\_authnz\_ldap: Add support for nested groups (i.e. the ability
to authorize an authenticated user via a "require ldap-group X" directive
where the user is not in group X, but is in a subgroup contained in X.
PR 42891 [Paul J. Reder]
\*) mod\_ssl: Add support for caching SSL Sessions in memcached. [Paul Querna]
\*) apxs: Enhance -q flag to print all known variables and their values
when invoked without variable name(s).
[William Rowe, Sander Temme]
\*) apxs: Eliminate run-time check for mod\_so. PR 40653.
[David M. Lee ]
\*) beos MPM: Create pmain pool and run modules' child\_init hooks when
entering ap\_mpm\_run(), then destroy pmain when exiting ap\_mpm\_run().
[Chris Darroch]
\*) netware MPM: Destroy pmain pool when exiting ap\_mpm\_run() so that
cleanups registered in modules' child\_init hooks are performed.
[Chris Darroch]
\*) Fix issue which could cause error messages to be written to access logs
on Win32. PR 40476. [Tom Donovan ]
\*) The LockFile directive, which specifies the location of
the accept() mutex lockfile, is deprecated. Instead, the
AcceptMutex directive now takes an optional lockfile
location parameter, ala SSLMutex. [Jim Jagielski]
\*) mod\_authn\_dbd: Export any additional columns queried in the SQL select
into the environment with the name AUTHENTICATE\_. This brings
mod\_authn\_dbd behaviour in line with mod\_authnz\_ldap. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_dbd: Key the storage of prepared statements on the hex string
value of server\_rec, rather than the server name, as the server name
may change (eg when the server name is set) at any time, causing
weird behaviour in modules dependent on mod\_dbd. [Graham Leggett]
\*) mod\_proxy\_fcgi: Added win32 build. [Mladen Turk]
\*) sendfile\_nonblocking() takes the \_brigade\_ as an argument, gets
the first bucket from the brigade, finds it not to be a FILE
bucket and barfs. The fix is to pass a bucket rather than a brigade.
[Niklas Edmundsson ]
\*) mod\_rewrite: support rewritemap by SQL query [Nick Kew]
\*) ap\_get\_server\_version() has been removed. Third-party modules must
now use ap\_get\_server\_banner() or ap\_get\_server\_description().
[Jeff Trawick]
\*) All MPMs: Introduce a check\_config phase between pre\_config and
open\_logs, to allow modules to review interdependent configuration
directive values and adjust them while messages can still be logged
to the console. Handle relevant MPM directives during this phase
and format messages for both the console and the error log, as
appropriate. [Chris Darroch]
\*) core: Do not allow internal redirects like the DirectoryIndex of mod\_dir
to circumvent the symbolic link checks imposed by FollowSymLinks and
SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. [Nick Kew, Ruediger Pluem, William Rowe]
\*) New SSLLogLevelDebugDump [ None (default) | IO (not bytes) | Bytes ]
configures the I/O Dump of SSL traffic, when LogLevel is set to Debug.
The default is none as this is far greater debugging resolution than
the typical administrator is prepared to untangle. [William Rowe]
\*) mod\_disk\_cache: If possible, check if the size of an object to cache is
within the configured boundaries before actually saving data.
[Niklas Edmundsson ]
\*) Worker and event MPMs: Remove improper scoreboard updates which were
performed in the event of a fork() failure. [Chris Darroch]
\*) Add support for fcgi:// proxies to mod\_rewrite.
[Markus Schiegl ]
\*) Remove incorrect comments from scoreboard.h regarding conditional
loading of worker\_score structure with mod\_status, and remove unused
definitions relating to old life\_status field.
[Chris Darroch ]
\*) Remove allocation of memory for unused array of lb\_score pointers
in ap\_init\_scoreboard(). [Chris Darroch ]
\*) Add mod\_proxy\_fcgi, a FastCGI back end for mod\_proxy.
[Garrett Rooney, Jim Jagielski, Paul Querna]
\*) Event MPM: Fill in the scoreboard's tid field. PR 38736.
[Chris Darroch ]
\*) mod\_charset\_lite: Remove Content-Length when output filter can
invalidate it. Warn when input filter can invalidate it.
[Jeff Trawick]
\*) Authz: Add the new module mod\_authn\_core that will provide common
authn directives such as 'AuthType', 'AuthName'. Move the directives
'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod\_authz\_alias
into mod\_authn\_core. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy'
into the new module mod\_access\_compat which can be loaded to provide
support for these directives.
[Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as
add the directives '', '', ''
and 'Reject' to mod\_authz\_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR'
logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Add the new module mod\_authz\_core which acts as the
authorization provider vector and contains common authz
directives. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Renamed mod\_authz\_dbm authz providers from 'group' and
'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
host-based access control provided by mod\_authz\_host and invoked
through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to
provider based. [Brad Nicholes]
\*) mod\_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
seconds to cache a document.
[Brian Akins , Ruediger Pluem]
\*) mod\_authz\_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]
\*) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
[Christophe Jaillet ]
\*) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM. [Brian Pane]
\*) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type. The logging of a request and
the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
of the response is sent; ap\_core\_output\_filter() calls the access logger
indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket. [Brian Pane]
\*) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]
\*) Rewrite of ap\_coreoutput\_filter to do nonblocking writes [Brian Pane]
\*) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
[Brian Pane]
\*) mod\_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs. PR 34264.
[Justin Erenkrantz]
\*) Teach mod\_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c0)  Kurt Newman    2015-02-03 21:17:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32428](attachment.cgi?id=32428 "GDB stack trace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=32428&action=edit "GDB stack trace") GDB stack trace  Basic setup instructions:  Set up shtml ErrorDocument definitions (and corresponding Handler), setup Listen directive for multiple ports, and create a virtual host block.  Background:  2.4.10 would handle this correctly, but now causes children (when in prefork mode) for 2.4.12 to segfaults.  Testing setup: 2.4.10 without patches 2.4.12 without patches  I've attached two basic configuration files that duplicate this succinctly, as well as a stack trace. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c1)  Kurt Newman    2015-02-03 21:18:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32429](attachment.cgi?id=32429 "httpd.conf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=32429&action=edit "httpd.conf") httpd.conf ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c2)  Kurt Newman    2015-02-03 21:18:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32430](attachment.cgi?id=32430 "errordocument.conf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=32430&action=edit "errordocument.conf") errordocument.conf ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c3)  Brian Behlendorf    2015-03-04 19:00:40 UTC  ``` I am hitting this too, oddly also with the same specific error, 400 Bad Gateway, with the default config file thus pulling in HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY.html.var.  I wonder if it's related to this snippet from:  <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html#misc>  "Multi-language error documents from 2.2.x may not work unless they are adjusted to the new syntax of mod_include's #if expr= element or the directive SSILegacyExprParser is enabled for the directory containing the error documents."  Is your "400.html" the same file as the stock HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY.html.var?  I tried to see if there was any particular error in HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY.html.var relating to the #if expr= syntax and didn't find anything obvious.  Nor could I reproduce the error with my hand-cobbled HTTP requests designed to trigger 400 responses, but I do get them in production, so realistic traffic can trigger it.  However, when I change my config to eliminate ONLY the following line from my extra/httpd-multilang-errordoc.conf:  #ErrorDocument 400 /error/HTTP_BAD_REQUEST.html.var  that stopped all my core dumps, so it strongly suggests either a bug in that error message's server-parsed HTML (which still shouldn't trigger a core dump!!) or an error while processing a bad HTTP request that makes setting up the CGI environment variables fail spectacularly.  Hoping this can get some attention from folks who'd know... ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c4)  Brian Behlendorf    2015-03-04 22:00:40 UTC  ``` More details:  A friend (jl) noted: > A quick glance at the code suggested that the request method is > not set up in the request object and in the function mentioned in the > stacktrace this leads to strcmp(NULL, "INCLUDED") -> segfault.  So I went about looking for odd-looking requests that might have no method set, and found (IP address anonymized):  x.x.x.x - - [04/Mar/2015:13:36:01 -0800] "\x16\x03\x03" 400 326 "-" "-"  Posts online suggested this was an SSL client attempting to talk SSL to port 80.  And in fact, I could reproduce this by trying to go to  <https://host:80/>  to the point where I could even generate a core, which I couldn't do before.  Anyways, looks like before that strcmp is called the request method should be tested for, or set.  Brian ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c5)  Kurt Newman    2015-03-04 22:09:07 UTC  ``` The way that I was able to re-produce this, was by Listening on 2 ports (80 and 443), accessing port 443, but for a virtual host that isn't defined on that port. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c6)  Eric Covener    2015-03-04 22:55:54 UTC  ``` Sorry, this is a recent regression that will be fixed shortly in trunk ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c7)  Jan Ludewig    2015-03-05 01:08:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Covener from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c6)) > Sorry, this is a recent regression that will be fixed shortly in trunk  Looks like you already found the problem?  still, minor correction: the "request method" I mentioned to brian (see [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c4)) was actually "r->protocol in ap_add_cgi_vars, in server/util_script.c. My bad, I had written from memory, not checked the actual source again.  Also, I'm looking at [revision 1661207](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1661207), not the released version. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c8)  Eric Covener    2015-03-05 02:36:39 UTC  ``` fixed in trunk and proposed for backport, sorry for the delay.    <http://svn.apache.org/r1664205> ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c9)  Kurt Newman    2015-03-05 18:16:29 UTC  ``` Awesome.  Thank you Eric! ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c10)  Yann Ylavic    2015-06-02 22:06:59 UTC  ``` Backported to 2.4.13 in [r1668879](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1668879). ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=57531#c11)  Yann Ylavic    2015-06-02 22:08:08 UTC  ``` And to 2.2.30 in [r1680927](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1680927). ``` |  |

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server proxy encoding problem ([CVE-2024-38473](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38473))

Encoding problem in mod\_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. This affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied, such as SetHandler or inadvertent proxying via CVE-2024-39573. Note that these alternate mechanisms may be used within .htaccess.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Server weakness in mod\_rewrite when first segment of substitution matches filesystem path. ([CVE-2024-38475](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38475))

Improper escaping of output in mod\_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.

### low: Apache HTTP Server: DoS in HTTP/2 with initial windows size 0 ([CVE-2023-43622](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43622))

An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.

This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.56

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

### critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773) ([CVE-2021-42013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42013))

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

Acknowledgements: Apache HTTP server would like to thank LI ZHI XIN from NSFoucs for reporting this.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### low: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name ([CVE-2017-15715](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15715))

The expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

### low: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request ([CVE-2018-1301](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1301))

A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.

### low: Possible write of after free on HTTP/2 stream shutdown ([CVE-2018-1302](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1302))

When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.33 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerabilty hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### low: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION denial of service ([CVE-2016-8740](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8740))

The HTTP/2 protocol implementation (mod\_http2) had an incomplete handling of the LimitRequestFields directive. This allowed an attacker to inject unlimited request headers into the server, leading to eventual memory exhaustion.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: IP address spoofing when proxying using mod\_remoteip and mod\_rewrite ([CVE-2020-11985](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-11985))

For configurations using proxying with mod\_remoteip and certain mod\_rewrite rules, an attacker could spoof their IP address for logging and PHP scripts. Note this issue was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.24 but was retrospectively allocated a low severity CVE in 2020.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-28 12:03:26 UTC  ``` This issue was actually fixed in version 2.4.13.  However, as versions 2.4.13, 2.4.14 and 2.4.15 were not released, 2.4.16 is the first released upstream version that includes the fix.  Upstream bug report for this issue:  <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57531>  Upstream commit (in 2.4.x branch) fixing the problem:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1668879>   Upstream notes that the issue only affected version starting with 2.4.11, which includes the following fix:    *) core: Support custom ErrorDocuments for HTTP 501 and 414 status codes.      PR 57167 [Edward Lu <Chaosed0 gmail.com>]  Upstream bug report:  <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57167>  Upstream commit (in 2.4.x branch):  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1638071>  This adds an ap_die() call to ap_read_request(), which eventually leads to the NULL pointer dereference issue for which [CVE-2015-0253](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0253) was assigned.   The above change is not include in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and earlier httpd packages, therefore they are not affected by this issue.  This issue causes httpd child process crash.  When using prefork MPM, such crash only affects attacker's connection.  For other MPMs, connections of other users may be affected.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2015-07-28 12:05:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7; JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1 and 2; JBoss Web Server 3; and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1243891#c5)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-30 00:51:50 UTC  ``` httpd-2.4.16-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Description

The read\_request\_line function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.12 does not initialize the protocol structure member, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and process crash) by sending a request that lacks a method to an installation that enables the INCLUDES filter and has an ErrorDocument 400 directive specifying a local URI.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
