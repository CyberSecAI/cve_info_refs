# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-19

## Out-of-bounds read and write while rendering SVG content

Announced
February 24, 2015
Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox OS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 36
* Firefox ESR 31.5
* Firefox OS 2.2
* SeaMonkey 2.33
* Thunderbird 31.5

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google
Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to report an out-of-bounds
read and an out-of-bounds write when rendering an improperly formatted SVG
graphic. This could potentially allow the attacker to read uninitialized memory.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# CVE-2015-0816

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2015-0815.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2015-0817.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-0816 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0816)

#### Description

Mozilla Firefox before 37.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.6, and Thunderbird before 31.6 do not properly restrict resource: URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges by leveraging the ability to bypass the Same Origin Policy, as demonstrated by the resource: URL associated with PDF.js.

This seems less bad than I initially thought. The bug allows an attacker to zero out memory beyond the end of an array, overshooting the array bounds by a few thousand bytes. It might also allow reading uninitialized memory, but only a few thousand bytes at a time. But as far as I can tell it doesn't allow \*writes\* of attacker-controlled data beyond array bounds.Component: GFX: Color Management → GraphicsHardware: x86\_64 → All

The format mismatch happens if the input filter has an A8 result surface in the regions where it has output. The mismatched B8G8R8A8 input enters into the loop when the tile filter requests a rect that is completely outside the input filter's output region - in that case, FilterNodeSoftware::GetOutput calls GetDataSurfaceInRect with a null surface, which causes GetDataSurfaceInRect to create an empty surface of the requested size with format B8G8R8A8.

part 1: do all the checks in release builds
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not that hard, but the exploit wouldn't be able to do all that much, see [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1117304#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow write in mozilla::gfx::CopyRect").
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
They show how to trigger the out-of-bounds write, but not what you can do with it. I have split the tests out into a separate patch. Should I hold off on landing them?
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All branches that use 28 or later.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 924103](/show_bug.cgi?id=924103 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use Moz2D for SVG filter rendering")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
They'll be very similar, easy to create, and not risky.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely to cause regressions, doesn't need much testing other than the reftests in the other patch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1195623#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-02-24 08:11:28 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to report an out-of-bounds read and an out-of-bounds write when rendering an improperly formatted SVG graphic. This could potentially allow the attacker to read uninitialized memory.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

All thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

```

All seamonkey-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-2.33.1"

```

All nspr users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nspr-4.10.6"

```

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0642)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0836, CVE-2015-0831, CVE-2015-0827)

An information leak flaw was found in the way Thunderbird implemented
autocomplete forms. An attacker able to trick a user into specifying a
local file in the form could use this flaw to access the contents of that
file. (CVE-2015-0822)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de
Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Paul
Bandha, Abhishek Arya, and Armin Razmdjou as the original reporters of
these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 31.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 31.5.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0266)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Thunderbird. (CVE-2015-0836, CVE-2015-0831, CVE-2015-0827)

An information leak flaw was found in the way Thunderbird implemented
autocomplete forms. An attacker able to trick a user into specifying a
local file in the form could use this flaw to access the contents of that
file. (CVE-2015-0822)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de
Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Paul
Bandha, Abhishek Arya, and Armin Razmdjou as the original reporters of
these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 31.5.0. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 31.5.0, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0265)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2015-0836, CVE-2015-0831, CVE-2015-0827)

An information leak flaw was found in the way Firefox implemented
autocomplete forms. An attacker able to trick a user into specifying a
local file in the form could use this flaw to access the contents of that
file. (CVE-2015-0822)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de
Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Paul
Bandha, Abhishek Arya, and Armin Razmdjou as the original reporters of
these issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 31.5.0 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 31.5.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Armin Razmdjou discovered that contents of locally readable files could

be made available via manipulation of form autocomplete in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-0822](/security/CVE-2015-0822))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds read and write when rendering

SVG content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-0827](/security/CVE-2015-0827))

Paul Bandha discovered a use-after-free in IndexedDB. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled,

an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-0831](/security/CVE-2015-0831))

Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron

Campen, Tom Schuster, and Ryan VanderMeulen discovered multiple memory

safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-0836](/security/CVE-2015-0836))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1195638#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2015-02-24 08:37:12 UTC  ``` Security researcher Armin Razmdjou reported that a user readable file in a known local path could be uploaded to a malicious site. This was done by manipulating the autocomplete feature in a form and user interaction with it. While the local file is not visibly uploaded through the form, its contents are made available through the Document Object Model (DOM) to script content on the attacking page, leading to information disclosure.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.    External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-24>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Armin Razmdjou as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1195638#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-02-24 22:40:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:0265 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0265.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1195638#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-02-25 12:39:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:0266 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0266.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1195638#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 14:12:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for PPC64 LE  Via RHSA-2015:0629 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:0629](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015%3A0629)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1195638#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 19:31:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:0642 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0642.html>   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Matthew Noorenberghe discovered that Mozilla domains in the allowlist

could make UITour API calls from background tabs. If one of these domains

were compromised and open in a background tab, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2015-0819](/security/CVE-2015-0819))

Jan de Mooij discovered an issue that affects content using the Caja

Compiler. If web content loads specially crafted code, this could be used

to bypass sandboxing security measures provided by Caja. ([CVE-2015-0820](/security/CVE-2015-0820))

Armin Razmdjou discovered that opening hyperlinks with specific mouse

and key combinations could allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened

without context restrictions being preserved. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to bypass security restrictions. ([CVE-2015-0821](/security/CVE-2015-0821))

Armin Razmdjou discovered that contents of locally readable files could

be made available via manipulation of form autocomplete in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2015-0822](/security/CVE-2015-0822))

Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free in the OpenType Sanitiser (OTS)

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2015-0823](/security/CVE-2015-0823))

Atte Kettunen discovered a crash when drawing images using Cairo in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2015-0824](/security/CVE-2015-0824))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer underflow during playback of MP3 files

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-0825](/security/CVE-2015-0825))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow during CSS restyling in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0826](/security/CVE-2015-0826))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds read and write when rendering

SVG content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening

a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-0827](/security/CVE-2015-0827))

A buffer overflow was discovered in libstagefright during video playback

in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially

crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a

denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0829](/security/CVE-2015-0829))

Daniele Di Proietto discovered that WebGL could cause a crash in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2015-0830](/security/CVE-2015-0830))

Paul Bandha discovered a use-after-free in IndexedDB. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0831](/security/CVE-2015-0831))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that a period appended to a hostname could

bypass key pinning and HSTS in some circumstances. A remote attacker could

potentially exloit this to conduct a Machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

([CVE-2015-0832](/security/CVE-2015-0832))

Alexander Kolesnik discovered that Firefox would attempt plaintext

connections to servers when handling turns: and stuns: URIs. A remote

attacker could potentially exploit this by conducting a Machine-in-the-middle

(MITM) attack in order to obtain credentials. ([CVE-2015-0834](/security/CVE-2015-0834))

Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Liz Henry, Byron

Campen, Tom Schuster, Ryan VanderMeulen, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman,

Randell Jesup, Robin Whittleton, Jon Coppeard, and Nikhil Marathe

discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0835](/security/CVE-2015-0835), [CVE-2015-0836](/security/CVE-2015-0836))

An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes one version update.
Description:
MozillaFirefox has been updated to version 31.5.0 ESR to fix five security
issues.
These security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2015-0836: Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser
engine in Mozilla Firefox before 31.5 allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors (bnc#917597).
\* CVE-2015-0827: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
mozilla::gfx::CopyRect function in Mozilla Firefox before 31.5
allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from
uninitialized process memory via a malformed SVG graphic
(bnc#917597).
\* CVE-2015-0835: Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser
engine in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0 allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors (bnc#917597).
\* CVE-2015-0831: Use-after-free vulnerability in the
mozilla::dom::IndexedDB::IDBObjectStore::CreateIndex function in
Mozilla Firefox before 31.5 allowed remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption)
via crafted content that is improperly handled during IndexedDB
index creation (bnc#917597).
\* CVE-2015-0822: The Form Autocompletion feature in Mozilla Firefox
before 31.5 allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files via
crafted JavaScript code (bnc#917597).
These non-security issues have been fixed:
\* Reverted desktop file name back to MozillaFirefox.desktop
(bnc#916196, bnc#917100)
\* Obsolete subpackages of firefox-gcc47 from SLE11-SP1/2, that caused
problems when upgrading to SLE11-SP3 (bnc#917300)

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
