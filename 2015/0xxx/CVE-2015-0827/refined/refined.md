  "CVE-2015-0827": {
    "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the mozilla::gfx::CopyRect function in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.5, and Thunderbird before 31.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized process memory via a malformed SVG graphic.",
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
    "impact": "Allows an attacker to potentially read uninitialized memory. In some contexts, it could lead to arbitrary code execution",
    "attack_vector": "Maliciously crafted SVG graphic, triggered during rendering.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to entice a user to open or render the crafted SVG, typically through a website or email (although email is less vulnerable due to script disabling)",
    "root_cause": "Improperly formatted SVG graphic triggers an out-of-bounds read and write in the mozilla::gfx::CopyRect function during rendering.",
    "affected_components": [
      "mozilla::gfx::CopyRect",
