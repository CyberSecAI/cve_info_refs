The document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-009, including CVE-2015-0029.

**CVE-2015-0029:**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer due to improper access of objects in memory.
*   **Vulnerability:** Memory corruption, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then needs to convince the user to view the malicious website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message or by exploiting compromised websites hosting user-provided content.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website and lure the victim to visit the website through social engineering or by compromising legitimate sites.

**Affected Software (for CVE-2015-0029 specifically):**

*   Internet Explorer 6 on Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition SP2 and Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems
