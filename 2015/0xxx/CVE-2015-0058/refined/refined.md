Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-0058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a double-free condition in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: The driver attempts to free the same memory location twice, leading to memory corruption.
- Improper validation of user mode function data: The vulnerability arises due to the driver not properly validating data returned from user mode before executing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Privilege escalation: An attacker could gain elevated privileges, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- System Compromise: This could allow complete system control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system.
- Malicious application: The attacker would need to execute a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability by triggering the double-free condition and escalating privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user with valid logon credentials.
- Ability to execute arbitrary applications on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).
- The fix involves correcting how the kernel-mode driver validates data returned from user-mode functions before being executed.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- There was no evidence of public exploitation at the time of the bulletin release.
