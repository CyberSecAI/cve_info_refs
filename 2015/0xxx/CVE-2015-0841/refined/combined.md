# libCapsiNetwork: Denial of service — GLSA **201507-12**

A buffer overflow in libcapsinetwork might allow remote attackers
to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/libcapsinetwork** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.3.0-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

libCapsiNetwork is a C++ network library to allow fast development of
server daemon processes.

### Description

An off-by-one buffer overflow in libcapsinetwork network handling code
is discovered.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to application,
that is linked with libcapsinetwork, possibly resulting in a Denial of
Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for libCapsiNetwork.
We recommend that users unmerge it:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-libs/libcapsinetwork"

```

Subject: monopd/libcapsinetwork: CVE-2015-0841: off-by-one error in network
code
Date: Mon, 23 Mar 2015 20:42:01 +0200
```
Package: monopd
Version: 0.9.7-2
Severity: normal
Tags: upstream patch security
Control: clone -1 -2
Control: reassign -2 libcapsinetwork0c2a 0.3.0-7
Control: found -2 0.3.0-8

There's an off-by-one error in libcapsinetwork network handling code,
which was merged into monopd in version 0.9.4.

From src/listener.cpp, Listener::checkActivity():

  #define MAXLINE 1024
[...]
  char *readBuf = new char[MAXLINE];
  int n = read((*it)->fd(), readBuf, MAXLINE);
  if (n <= 0) // socket was closed
  {
          (*it)->setStatus(Socket::Closed);
          delete[] readBuf;
          return; // notification is (still) in earlier iteration
  }
  readBuf[n] = 0;

With an input line longer than 1023, this will write zero at readBuf[1024]
which is out of bounds.

Florian Weimer from the security team says this isn't exploitable with
the glibc malloc (dlmalloc), but might theoretically be with other malloc
implementations like jemalloc. [CVE-2015-0841](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0841) has been assigned to track
this potential vulnerability, but I'm leaving the severity at 'normal'
as this doesn't seem to be an issue for Debian.

I have informed the monopd upstream maintainer, Sylvain Rochet, about this.
His suggested patch was

 - char *readBuf = new char[MAXLINE];
 + char *readBuf = new char[MAXLINE+1];  // MAXLINE + '\0'

The issue is present in at least

 monopd_0.9.7-2 (jessie/sid, embeds the code)
 libcapsinetwork_0.3.0-7 (wheezy, used by the wheezy monopd)
 libcapsinetwork_0.3.0-8 (jessie/sid, no reverse dependencies)

The wheezy monopd doesn't contain the bug itself, only through
libcapsinetwork linkage.

I'm cloning a separate bug for libcapsinetwork. Please note that it's dead
upstream (according to debian/copyright), and monopd upstream says it
could be safely removed as no one should really want to use it anymore.

Since upstream and the security team agree that this is not exploitable
and thus not release critical, I suggest to fix this bug only in sid and
stretch.

My original intention was to ask for the removal of libcapsinetwork
during the release cycle of stretch because the library seemed stable
and reliable enough to warrant another inclusion in Debian stable. Given
the fact that libcapsinetwork only supports IPv4 and the network code
(including IPv6 support) is already included in monopd, we could also
ask for the removal right now.

If there are no objections, I will go ahead and ask the ftp team to
remove libcapsinetwork from Debian (including Jessie).

Regards,

Markus

Now that the CVE is public, I released monopd 0.9.8 containing:

Peter Pentchev (2):
      Check for libsystemd in preference to libsystemd-daemon.
      Fix a couple of typographical and grammatical errors.

Sylvain Rochet (2):

I agree too, I actually asked for ;-)

Hi Sylvain,

thanks for taking care of that so quickly. I will upload the new version

Subject: CVE-2015-0841: off-by-one error in network code of monopd/libcapsinetwork

Niko Tyni privately reported this to us, but we don't think it is
exploitable with dlmalloc, so we skipped the embargo:

| There's an off-by-one error in libcapsinetwork network handling code,
| which was merged into monopd in version 0.9.4.
|
| From src/listener.cpp, Listener::checkActivity():
|
|   #define MAXLINE 1024
| [...]
|   char *readBuf = new char[MAXLINE];
|   int n = read((*it)->fd(), readBuf, MAXLINE);
|   if (n <= 0) // socket was closed
|   {
|           (*it)->setStatus(Socket::Closed);
|           delete[] readBuf;
|           return; // notification is (still) in earlier iteration
|   }
|   readBuf[n] = 0;
|
| With an input line longer than 1023, this will write zero at readBuf[1024]
| which is out of bounds.
