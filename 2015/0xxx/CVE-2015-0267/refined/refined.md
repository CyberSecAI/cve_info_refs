Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `module-setup.sh` script within the `kexec-tools` package. This script creates temporary files in an insecure manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The script uses predictable temporary file names, making it vulnerable to a symbolic link attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local malicious user can exploit this flaw by creating a symbolic link to a target file. When the `module-setup.sh` script attempts to create a temporary file, it could inadvertently overwrite the linked target file, leading to arbitrary file overwrite.
- **Privilege Escalation / Local Denial of Service (according to bug report)**: The initial bug report indicates potential for local privilege escalation or a denial of service as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `kexec-tools` is installed.
- **Ability to Create Symbolic Links:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to how the `module-setup.sh` script in `kexec-tools` creates temporary files.
- The provided information also mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Harald Hoyer of Red Hat.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in the RHSA-2015:0986 security advisory, which provides updated `kexec-tools` packages for various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
