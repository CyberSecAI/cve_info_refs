How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

|  | McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator Authenticated XXE and Credential Disclosure |
|  | Trial available here: |
|  | https://secure.mcafee.com/apps/downloads/free-evaluations/survey.aspx?mktg=ESD1172&cid=ESD1172&eval=A0C692FB-8E29-4D47-BBF1-43CAB5F10069&region=us |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator suffers from an authenticated XXE vulnerability, available to any authenticated user. The Server Task Log option in the upper left menu is where the vulnerability lies. When creating a custom filter, a bit of XML is passed from the client to the server to create the said filter. This parameter is called 'conditionXML' and is vulnerable to an XXE attack. The attack seems a bit limited however, as you can only fit up to 255 characters in the 'value' field. |
|  |  |
|  | However, a file in the web server installation configuration directory called 'keystore.properties' is less than the size we need, and contains an encrypted passphrase that is set during installation. When installing, an initial admin user is created (with 'admin' as the default username'). The password supplied here will also become the password for the local 'sa' SQL user, if you choose to install a local SQL server, and it will be the password for the application's certificate key store (hence the name of the properties file). |
|  |  |
|  | This passphrase is encrypted using a static key, and uses a weak cipher (AES-128-ECB). |
|  |  |
|  | The supplied metasploit module will authenticate as a given user, exploit the XXE to retrieve the encrypted passphrase, then decrypt it and print the decrypted password out for the user. |
|  |  |
|  | By default, if a local SQL server has been installed, it the SQL server will listen on all interfaces. Since the application uses the 'sa' user by default, the password supplied during installation can be used to log in remotely as the 'sa' user, allowing for remote command execution. |

|  | This module will exploit an authenticated XXE vulnerability to read the keystore.properties |
|  | off of the filesystem. This properties file contains an encrypted password that is set during |
|  | installation. What is interesting about this password is that it is set as the same password |
|  | as the database 'sa' user and of the admin user created during installation. This password |
|  | is encrypted with a static key, and is encrypted using a weak cipher at that (ECB). By default, |
|  | if installed with a local SQL Server instance, the SQL server is listening on all interfaces. |
|  |  |
|  | Recovering this password allows an attacker to potentially authenticate as the 'sa' SQL Server |
|  | user in order to achieve remote command execution with permissions of the database process. If |
|  | the administrator has no changed the password for the initially created account since installation, |
|  | the attacker also now has the password for this account. By default, 'admin' is recommended. |
|  |  |
|  | Any user account can be used to exploit this, all that is needed is a pair of credentials. |
|  |  |
|  | The most data that can be successfully retrieved is 255 characters due to length restrictions |

# McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator Authenticated XXE and Credential Exposure

```
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator Authenticated XXE and Credential Disclosure

Trial available here:

<https://secure.mcafee.com/apps/downloads/free-evaluations/survey.aspx?mktg=ESD1172&cid=ESD1172&eval=A0C692FB-8E29-4D47-BBF1-43CAB5F10069&region=us>

McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator suffers from an authenticated XXE
vulnerability, available to any authenticated user. The Server Task Log
option in the upper left menu is where the vulnerability lies. When
creating a custom filter, a bit of XML is passed from the client to the
server to create the said filter. This parameter is called 'conditionXML'
and is vulnerable to an XXE attack. The attack seems a bit limited however,
as you can only fit up to 255 characters in the 'value' field.

 However, a file in the web server installation configuration directory
called 'keystore.properties' is less than the size we need, and contains an
encrypted passphrase that is set during installation. When installing, an
initial admin user is created (with 'admin' as the default username'). The
password supplied here will also become the password for the local 'sa' SQL
user, if you choose to install a local SQL server, and it will be the
password for the application's certificate key store (hence the name of the
properties file).

 This passphrase is encrypted using a static key, and uses a weak cipher
(AES-128-ECB).

 The supplied metasploit module will authenticate as a given user, exploit
the XXE to retrieve the encrypted passphrase, then decrypt it and print the
decrypted password out for the user.

 By default, if a local SQL server has been installed, it the SQL server
will listen on all interfaces. Since the application uses the 'sa' user by
default, the password supplied during installation can be used to log in
remotely as the 'sa' user, allowing for remote command execution.

Metasploit module attached.

```
After releasing this, I actually got quite a bit of flak (whatever happened
to responsible/coordinated disclosure?!).

Today, Space Rogue wrote a pretty good article about Full Disclosure:
<https://twitter.com/spacerog/status/554704824705761280>

I tend to agree with the post, and I feel that this vulnerability actually
is a great example of the points Space Rogue makes.

For instance, according to McAfee's official KB article (
<https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10095>), version 4.x
of ePO will have a fix sometime next month. However, 5.x releases won't
have a fix until Q2 of this year!

Having dropped the vulnerabilities as I did, McAfee decided to provide a
work-around within the KB for anyone wanting to defend themselves against
anyone attempting to exploit the vulnerability. I always assume if I have
found a vulnerability, someone else has found it as well. If I had
coordinated with McAfee, the consumers whom were running vulnerable
instances ePO would have been left vulnerable with no knowledge of having
been vulnerable in the first place until the patch came out months after
initial discovery. Since this was dropped in full disclosure, now their
customers can actually do something to prevent exploitation between now and
when an official patch is released.

I completely consider this a win for any of McAfee's customers running ePO.
Is it more responsible to coordinate with a slow-moving software company to
help them save face, leaving their own customers vulnerable while a patch
is worked up? Or is it more responsible to force the company to act quickly
and at least provide a work-around/mitigation publicly while a patch is
worked on? I go with the latter.
