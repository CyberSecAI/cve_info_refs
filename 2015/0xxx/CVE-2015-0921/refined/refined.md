Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an authenticated XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw in the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The 'conditionXML' parameter, used when creating custom filters in the Server Task Log, is vulnerable to XXE injection.
*   **Credential Exposure:** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can read the `keystore.properties` file which contains an encrypted passphrase.
*   **Weak Cryptography:** The passphrase in `keystore.properties` is encrypted using a static key and a weak cipher (AES-128-ECB), making it easily decryptable once retrieved.
*   **Shared Credentials:** The decrypted passphrase is used for the ePO keystore, the 'sa' SQL user (if a local SQL server is installed), and potentially the initial admin user account, thereby providing broad access to a successful attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain the decrypted passphrase, which can be used to access the ePO keystore.
*   **Database Access:** The attacker can use the passphrase to log in remotely as the 'sa' SQL user if a local SQL server instance is used by ePO, enabling remote command execution on the server.
*   **System Compromise:**  With SQL server access, the attacker can potentially gain control over the database server and the operating system itself.
*   **Administrative Access:** If the initial admin user password wasn't changed from the installation time, the attacker gains administrative level access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated Web Access:** The attack is performed through the web interface of McAfee ePO, requiring valid user credentials.
*   **Custom Filter Creation:** The specific attack vector involves manipulating the 'conditionXML' parameter when creating custom filters in the Server Task Log.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have a valid username and password to log into the McAfee ePO web interface, although it can be any authenticated user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target ePO server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XXE vulnerability in the 'conditionXML' parameter and the path to the `keystore.properties` file, as well as the static key and weak encryption algorithm used to protect the passphrase in the mentioned file.
