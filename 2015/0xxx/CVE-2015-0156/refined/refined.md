Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-0156

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input within the Process Admin Console of IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored/persistent XSS flaw. User-supplied input isn't properly sanitized or validated, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts that are then executed within the victim's web browser. The script executes in the security context of the hosting website.
- **Credential Theft:** Specifically mentioned is the potential to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials, leading to account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by a victim, triggers the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with a malicious URL, which executes the injected script in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL containing the malicious script.
- **Victim Interaction:**  The attacker needs the victim to click the crafted URL to trigger the XSS.
- **Authenticated User:** The CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) indicates that authentication is required.
- The attacker can steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
