- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation and enforcement of impersonation levels in Microsoft Windows during process creation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core issue is the inadequate handling of impersonation events, which allows an attacker to bypass security checks associated with impersonation levels. Specifically, the vulnerability is exploitable when a process uses SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to elevate their privileges to administrator level. This grants the attacker the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system. They then execute a specially crafted application designed to leverage the vulnerability, which results in privilege escalation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system and be able to execute a specially crafted program. The attacker also needs to have some knowledge of the vulnerability and the SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege to craft the exploit.
