## Vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3031432)

Published: February 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could acquire administrator credentials and use them to elevate privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates impersonation events. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Windows Create Process Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0062

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when it fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass impersonation-level security checks and gain elevated privileges on a targeted system. This vulnerability can be exploited only in the specific scenario where the process uses SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, which is not available for normal processes.

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could acquire administrator credentials and use them to elevate privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates impersonation events.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
