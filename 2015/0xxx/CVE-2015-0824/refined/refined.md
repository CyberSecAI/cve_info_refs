Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A crash occurs in the Cairo graphics library when drawing images using the `DrawTarget` function. Specifically, a segmentation fault happens due to zeroing out of memory outside the bounds of the image. This occurs when a surface with invalid dimensions is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access (specifically, an out-of-bounds write) when allocating memory for a drawing surface.
- Improper error handling of invalid surface sizes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) via a segmentation fault leading to a browser crash. This can occur in both the main browser process and plugin containers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page. The exploit can be triggered by rendering an image with very large dimensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the image dimensions being rendered in the browser to trigger the crash.
- The attacker must also convince the user to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using the Address Sanitizer tool.
- The fix involves propagating error codes up the call chain when an invalid surface size is detected, which prevents the out-of-bounds memory access.
- The initial security rating for this issue was 'moderate', which was considered appropriate for this bug.
- While the primary crash was addressed, similar issues (though with different crash stacks) were found in other platforms, prompting the creation of additional bug reports.
- The provided information indicates that while the initial issue was addressed for linux based systems, the same test case caused a different crash on OS X.

The provided information from the bug report (bug 1095925) confirms the CVE description and provides a lot of additional detail.
