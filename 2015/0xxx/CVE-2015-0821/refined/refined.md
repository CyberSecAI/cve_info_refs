  "CVE-2015-0821": {
    "description": "Opening hyperlinks with specific mouse and key combinations could allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being preserved. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. Local files or privileged URLs in pages can be opened into new tabs.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how Firefox handles links opened with specific keyboard and mouse combinations, which bypasses security checks and allows opening of privileged URLs (like chrome://) or local files without proper context restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper context restriction enforcement",
      "Inadequate security checks when opening links in new tabs or windows."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious page, which could then open privileged chrome URLs or local files with the user's privileges, bypassing normal security restrictions. This can lead to information disclosure or further attacks leveraging local file access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user needs to be tricked into opening a specially crafted web page.",
      "The user needs to use specific mouse and keyboard combinations (like CTRL or SHIFT while clicking a link) to trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Malicious code can be injected into a web page that uses an iframe to load a link with a crafted url. If the user clicks this link while holding down the SHIFT or CTRL key, the crafted url can be loaded."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to host or inject malicious HTML content on a web page that a user visits. They also need to trick the user into clicking on the link in a specific way (e.g. by holding down the SHIFT or CTRL key while clicking)",
