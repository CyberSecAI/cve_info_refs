{
  "CVE-2015-0226": {
    "Root cause": "A prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception, allowing an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487)",
      "Leaking information on decryption failure via exceptions."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted messages that could expose the location of decryption failure"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker"
  }
