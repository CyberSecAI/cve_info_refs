Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that SDDM (Simple Desktop Display Manager) did not properly disable the KDE crash handler. Some themes, particularly the "breeze" theme from plasma-workspace, could load KDE components that automatically activate the KDE crash handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Security Controls:** SDDM failed to prevent the KDE crash handler from being loaded by certain themes.
*   **Privilege Escalation via Crash Handler:**  When a greeter using such a theme crashed, the KDE crash handler would be activated. This crash handler runs with the privileges of the locked-down SDDM user, potentially allowing access to restricted functionalities or resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, by crashing the greeter using a vulnerable theme, could potentially gain a shell with the privileges of the SDDM user. This could lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Triggering a Greeter Crash:** The attacker needs to find a way to crash the SDDM greeter (the login screen) while using a vulnerable theme (like the "breeze" theme).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user of the system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Theme:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific themes (like "breeze") that trigger the KDE crash handler and how to crash the greeter when using such theme.
*   **Ability to Cause a Crash:** The attacker has to be able to induce a crash in the greeter component.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves disabling the KDE crash handler by setting the `KDE_DEBUG` environment variable to `1` within the SDDM greeter process. This counterintuitive setting disables the KDE debug handler.
*   The vulnerable code was located in `src/daemon/Greeter.cpp`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in SDDM version 0.13.0.
