Disable greeters from loading KDE's debug hander

Some themes may use KDE components which will automatically load KDE's
crash handler.

If the greeter were to then somehow crash, that would leave a crash
handler allowing other actions, albeit as the locked down SDDM user.

Only SDDM users using the breeze theme from plasma-workspace are
affected. Safest and simplest fix is to handle this inside SDDM
disabling kcrash via an environment variable for all future themes that
may use these libraries.

Subject: CVE-2015-0856: sddm does not prevent access to the KDE crash handler

Pavel Avgustinov discovered that sddm does not disable the KDE crash
handler, and certain themes would allow shell access to the sddm user
as a result in case of a crash.

Upstream fix:

The SDDM team is proud to announce the release 0.13.0 of SDDM,
the Simple Desktop Display Manager.

SDDM is made possible thanks to the collaborative work of the [Hawaii](http://hawaiios.org),
[KDE](https://www.kde.org) and [LXDE](http://lxqt.org) projects, as well as the help and contributions from dozens
of other developers.

Change log:

* Greeter inherits path environment variables from parent so that
  themes installed in non-standard paths will work.
* Add ENABLE\_PAM option to toggle PAM support at build time.
* Allow overriding textColor in ComboBox.
* Don't cast QByteArray to (char \*).
* Disable greeters from loading KDE's debug hander
  (fix CVE-2015-0856).
* Fix multi-screen support for some setups.
* Added Serbian translation.
* Added Traditional Chinese translation.
* Improved German translation.
* Remove failsafe session entry.
* Close the pipe fd passed to X server.
* A few micro-optimizations.

The list of changes is also available in our ChangeLog file:
