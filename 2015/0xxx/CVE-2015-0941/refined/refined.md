- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Inetc plugin for the NSIS installer does not validate SSL certificate chains when downloading files over HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can spoof content retrieved via HTTPS. Depending on how the installer processes the downloaded content, this could lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify HTTPS traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between the installer and the server hosting the files. The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the victim's machine prior to the attack, just the ability to perform a MITM.
