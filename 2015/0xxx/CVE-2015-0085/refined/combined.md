## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3038999)

Published: March 10, 2015 | Updated: March 26, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Office 2013. This security update is rated Important for the following affected software:

* Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Word 2007
* Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Word 2010
* Microsoft Word 2013
* Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Excel Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack
* Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, Word Automation Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013, Excel Services on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013
* Microsoft Web Applications 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013, Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013

For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files, by correcting how Office handles files in memory, and by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Office Component Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0085

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software that is caused when the Office software improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This could corrupt system memory in such a way as to allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit it, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0086

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office software when the Office software fails to properly handle rich text format files in memory.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then, for example, take actions on the behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. Note that the Preview Pane is an attack vector for this vulnerability. In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit it, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Office handles files in memory.

## Multiple SharePoint XSS Vulnerabilities

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server. The attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user.These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user input.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers.
