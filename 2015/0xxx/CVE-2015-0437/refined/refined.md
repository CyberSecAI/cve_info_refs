```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the way the Hotspot JVM code compiler generated optimized code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Code generation issue in OpenJDK Hotspot component.
- Impact of exploitation: An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
- Attack vectors: Exploiting the code generation flaw in the Hotspot JVM by an untrusted Java application or applet.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to deploy or run an untrusted Java application or applet within a vulnerable environment.
