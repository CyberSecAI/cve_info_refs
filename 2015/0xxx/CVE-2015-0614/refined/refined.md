Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-0614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incorrect processing of crafted SIP INVITE messages within the Connection Conversation Manager (CuCsMgr) process of Cisco Unity Connection. Specifically, different fields in the SIP INVITE message are improperly handled compared to CVE-2015-0613.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of crafted SIP INVITE messages.
*   The CuCsMgr process is susceptible to core dumps and restarts due to this incorrect processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause the CuCsMgr process to crash and restart.
*   This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering Cisco Unity Connection unavailable for processing calls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted SIP INVITE messages to the Cisco Unity Connection server.
*   The vulnerability is independent of transport protocols and can be exploited with UDP, TCP, or TLS connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted SIP INVITE messages to the target Cisco Unity Connection server.
*   No authentication is required.
*   The attacker can be remote, not requiring local access.

**Additional details:**

*   The document explicitly notes the difference between CVE-2015-0613 and CVE-2015-0614 lies in the specific fields within the SIP INVITE message that trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is associated with Cisco bug ID CSCul26267.
*   The vulnerability only affects Cisco Unity Connection systems integrated with SIP. SCCP integrations are not affected.
