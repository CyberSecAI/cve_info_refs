Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is not explicitly stated but is due to multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager that allow for several types of attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF): Allows an attacker to force a user to perform unintended actions on a web application where they are authenticated.
- Phishing: An attack that attempts to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details, often by disguising as a trusted entity in an electronic communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct XSS, XSRF, and phishing attacks. These could result in:
    - The compromise of user accounts.
    - The execution of malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    - The theft of sensitive information.
    - The manipulation of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacks are launched remotely through network access.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system in order to launch the attack.
- Attack vectors may involve malicious links, crafted web pages, or other means of tricking users into interacting with the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Cisco Unified Communications Manager system.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft malicious input and trick users to execute them.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) and a temporal score of 3.7 (E:H/RL:OF/RC:C).
- The vulnerable product at the time of advisory is Cisco Unified Communications Manager 10.5(2.10000.5).
- It advises administrators to apply appropriate updates to remediate the vulnerability and encourages users to verify that unsolicited links are safe before clicking.
- It also suggests monitoring affected systems for potential malicious activity.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the described vulnerabilities at the time of the advisory release.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply appropriate updates provided by Cisco.
- Educate users to be cautious of unsolicited links.
- Monitor affected systems for malicious activity.
