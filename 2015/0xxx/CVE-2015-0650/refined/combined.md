Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable. Cisco mDNS Gateway functionality is enabled by default on Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. There is no specific configuration on the affected device needed to process mDNS packets.      To determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device would process mDNS packets, log in to the device and issue either of the following command-line interface (CLI) commands: **show ip socket, show udp,** or **show control-plane host open-ports**. If the output shows any IP addresses listening on UDP port 5353, the device is vulnerable.      The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the socket is open on UDP port 5353:   ```   Router#show ip socket     Proto Remote Port Local Port In Out Stat TTY OutputIF    17 --listen-- 192.168.0.1 67 0 0 1 0    17 --listen-- 192.168.0.1 68 0 0 1 0    17 --listen-- 224.0.0.251 5353 0 0 1 0   Router#      Router#sho udp    Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF   17     224.0.0.251      5353 --any--          5353   0   0 1000021   0    17(v6) FF02::FB         5353 --any--          5353   0   0 1020021   0    Router#      Router#sho control-plane host open-ports    Active internet connections (servers and established)   Prot               Local Address             Foreign Address                  Service    State    tcp                        *:22                         *:0               SSH-Server   LISTEN    tcp                        *:23                         *:0                   Telnet   LISTEN    udp                      *:5353               224.0.0.251:0         IOS host service   LISTEN   Router#      ```      **Note:** The behavior of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software prior to the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028 is to turn the mDNS functionality on by default. This behavior was changed in response to Cisco bug ID CSCum51028 and is now disabled by default. If the administrator wants to enable mDNS functionality, it must be manually configured on a device.      On Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that have a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, mDNS Gateway functionality must be explicitly enabled by configuring the **service-routing mdns-sd** CLI global configuration command. On those releases, if the command **service-routing mdns-sd** is in the configuration, the device may be vulnerable.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated   ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco Service Discovery Gateway (mDNS Gateway) is a Cisco IOS component that allows for controlled and secure access to services and devices across subnets. It listens to service announcements on all configured network segments and builds a cache of services and addresses.      A vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway function of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reload the vulnerable device.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of mDNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets on UDP port 5353. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      This vulnerability can be exploited using either IPv4 or IPv6 packets. The vulnerability can be triggered by malformed packets destined for UDP port 5353 using the IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of any interface configured on a device, the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.251, or the IPv6 multicast address FF02::FB.      This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic transiting an affected device.      In devices that meet the vulnerable configuration criteria, malformed UDP mDNS packets could trigger this vulnerability. An attacker with knowledge of the infrastructure could craft mDNS packets with set conditions to exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in a reload of the affected device.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCup70579](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup70579) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0650.  Workarounds  * **Access Control Lists**      On Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that do not have a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, there is currently no way to manually close the port or disable the service.      On those releases, a possible workaround consists of configuring an extended access control list (ACL) that can be created and applied to an interface to block traffic destined to UDP port 5353.      Because the mDNS feature in this vulnerability uses UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. In addition to ACLs, administrators should enable uRPF, a security feature of Cisco IOS Software that verifies the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The combination of these two technologies offers a stronger workaround than ACLs alone.      The following ACL example should be included as part of the deployed interface access list, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:   ```   !---   !--- Deny IPv4 mDNS traffic to a device   !---       access-list 150 deny udp any any eq 5353        !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in    !--- accordance with existing security policies and    !--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the   !--- device.        access-list 150 permit ip any any        !---   !--- Deny IPv6 mDNS traffic to a device   !---    ipv6 access-list v6_list     deny udp any any eq 5353        !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv6 traffic in    !--- accordance with existing security policies and    !--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the   !--- device.        permit ipv6 any any        !--- Apply access list to all interfaces (only one example   !--- shown)        interface fastEthernet 2/0    ip access-group 150 in     ipv6 traffic-filter v6_list in         ```      **Control Plane Policing**      Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted UDP traffic to the device. Cisco IOS Software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations.      The following CoPP example should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:   ```   !---   !--- Match IPv4 mDNS traffic with permit statement   !---       access-list 150 permit udp any any eq 5353        !--- Permit (police or drop)/Deny (allow) all other Layer 3 and    !--- Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies    !--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent    !--- to infrastructure devices    !---       access-list 150 deny ip any any        !--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by   !--- the CoPP feature   !---      class-map match-all drop-udp-class    match access-group 150      !--- Create a policy map that will be applied to the    !--- control plane of the device.        policy-map drop-udp-traffic class drop-udp-class drop        !--- Apply the policy map to the    !--- control plane of the device        control-plane service-policy    input drop-udp-traffic      ```      In the preceding CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACE) that match the potential exploit packets with the **permit** action cause these packets to be discarded by the policy map **drop** function, while packets that match the **deny** action (not shown) are not affected by the policy map **drop** function. Note that the policy map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains:   ```   policy-map drop-udp-traffic      class drop-udp-class      police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop      ```      Additional information about the configuration and use of the CoPP feature is in Control Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices and Control Plane Policing.      On Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that contain a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, mDNS Gateway functionality can be disabled by configuring the **no service-routing mdns-sd** CLI global configuration command.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=37485>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
