```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel-mode driver (cng.sys) fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Security Feature Bypass due to improper validation of impersonation levels.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain access to information beyond the access level of the local user.
Attack vectors: An attacker could convince a user to run a specially crafted application designed to cause CNG to improperly validate impersonation levels.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to convince a user to execute a malicious application.
