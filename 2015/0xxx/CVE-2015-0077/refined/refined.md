The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities, and CVE-2015-0077 is one of them.

**Vulnerability:** Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0077

*   **Root Cause:** The Windows kernel-mode driver fails to initialize function buffers in a manner that removes the results of previous function calls.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of function buffers in the kernel-mode driver leads to the disclosure of kernel memory contents.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain information about the system by reading kernel memory contents which could then be used in conjunction with other attacks to compromise the system, such as bypassing ASLR. Note that this vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this by running a specially crafted application that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker would need to log on to the system and be able to execute code on the target machine.
