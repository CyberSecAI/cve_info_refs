## Vulnerabilities in Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3034344)

Published: March 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory and by correcting how it validates a calling threadâs token. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3034344](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3034344).

## Affected Software

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0077

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver that could allow the disclosure of kernel memory contents to an attacker. This vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver fails to initialize function buffers in a manner that removes the results of previous function calls.

An attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability to gain information about the system that could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use it in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The update addresses this vulnerability by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

## Win32k Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0078

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver that is caused when the kernel-mode driver fails to properly validate the calling threadâs token.

An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could acquire administrator credentials and use them to elevate privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the kernel-mode driver validates a calling threadâs token.

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0094

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver that could allow the disclosure of kernel memory contents to an attacker. This vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver leaks private address information during a function call.

An attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability to gain information about the system that could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use it in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

## Microsoft Windows Kernel Memory Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0095

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver that could allow the disclosure of kernel memory contents to an attacker. This vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver dereferences a NULL pointer. The NULL page is not typically allocated or mapped, so if the kernel dereferences a NULL pointer the usual result is a blue-screen condition. However, a blue-screen condition can be avoided if the NULL page is mapped and, because the NULL page resides in the user-mode memory address space, the attacker can copy kernel information into the NULL page and read its contents. This attack vector is not viable when NULL page mapping is disabled, which is the default state in Windows 8 and later operating systems.

An attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability to gain information about the system that could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use it in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The update addresses this vulnerability by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
