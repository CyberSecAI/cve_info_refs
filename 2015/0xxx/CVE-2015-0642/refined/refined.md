Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-0642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the way Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software process malformed IKEv2 packets. Specifically, the IKEv2 module is vulnerable to processing certain crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of malformed IKEv2 packets.
*   Potential for memory depletion due to processing malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a device reload, causing a denial of service.
*   **Memory Depletion**: An attacker can cause memory depletion that can also lead to a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending malformed IKEv2 packets over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **UDP Ports**: The vulnerability can be triggered on UDP ports 500, 4500 (NAT-T), and 848 (GDOI when G-IKEv2 for GETVPN is enabled)
*   **IPv4 and IPv6:** The vulnerability can be exploited using either IPv4 or IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to reach the vulnerable device.
*   **Ability to Craft Malformed IKEv2 Packets:** The attacker must be able to generate or have access to malformed IKEv2 packets.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to the device to exploit this.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory states there are no workarounds available.
*   IKEv2 is automatically enabled when IKEv1 or ISAKMP is enabled, however, only malformed IKEv2 packets can trigger this vulnerability.
*   The advisory includes a list of affected IOS and IOS XE versions, and indicates first fixed versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing and resolution of customer cases, and not through public disclosure or active exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCum36951.
*   The advisory includes CVSS v2 score as Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
