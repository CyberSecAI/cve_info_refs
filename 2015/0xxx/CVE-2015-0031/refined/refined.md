- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They could also leverage compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content by adding malicious content. The user must be convinced to visit the attacker-controlled content, typically through links in emails or instant messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to view it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
