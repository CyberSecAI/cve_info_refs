- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The XZERES 442SR wind turbine operating system (OS) recognizes both POST and GET methods for data input. The vulnerability exists because it processes GET requests that should be handled with POST.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The system does not properly validate the source of requests, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can retrieve the username and password from the browser.
    - An attacker can change the default user password.
    - This can lead to a loss of power for all connected systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible by crafting a malicious GET request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable system. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the CSRF vulnerability.
