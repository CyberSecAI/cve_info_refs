The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2015-0003.

**CVE-2015-0003**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32k.sys) improperly handling objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of objects in memory leads to an elevation of privilege vulnerability. The kernel-mode driver fails to validate certain parameters against registered objects.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain elevated privileges, allowing them to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker must be able to log on locally to the system.

This document provides more detail than the standard CVE description by outlining the specific root cause (improper memory object handling in win32k.sys), the impact, and the attack vector.
