## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3036220)

Published: February 10, 2015 | Updated: February 18, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or visit an untrusted website that contains embedded TrueType fonts.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1; it is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver validates certain parameters against registered objects, validates and enforces impersonation levels, handles objects in memory, validates data returned from user mode functions before being executed, handles TrueType Font error checking, and checks font widths prior to loading fonts into memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3036220](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3036220).

**Note** The 3013455 update is available for Windows Technical Preview and Windows Server Technical Preview. Customers running these operating systems are encouraged to apply the update via Windows Update.
[1]This update is available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130) only.

## Update FAQ

**For the 3013455 update, why are there two packages on the Microsoft Download Center pages for affected editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista?**
An additional, non-security update was implemented for affected editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista to address problems with text quality degradation that some customers experienced after installing the 3013455 update. Note that the additional package (3037639) is not needed to be protected from the vulnerabilities addressed by the 3013455 update; it simply corrects the text quality problem. Customers should also be aware that the 3037639 update does require a system restart after installation.
