Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0871:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `shiromuku(u1)GUESTBOOK` software, which is a bulletin board application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the software doesn't sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in the generated HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary malicious scripts into the web page. When a user visits the affected page, the attacker's script executes within the user's browser, which can result in:
   - Theft of cookies and session tokens.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Defacement of the website.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
   - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-supplied input to the `shiromuku(u1)GUESTBOOK` application, likely via the guestbook posting functionality. An attacker crafts a malicious script within their guestbook post and submits it. When other users view the affected guestbook entries, the injected script executes in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to submit a guestbook entry or some other form of user-controlled input.
   - The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication to submit the malicious input.
