Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0837:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from data-dependent timing variations in the `mpi_powm()` function, which is used for modular exponentiation. These timing variations occur when accessing an internal pre-computed table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Side-channel attack: The vulnerability is a side-channel attack, specifically a timing attack, where an attacker can potentially infer secret information by observing the timing differences in the execution of the modular exponentiation routine.
- Data-dependent timing: The execution time of the vulnerable code varies depending on the data being processed, which can be exploited to extract information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential information disclosure: By observing the timing variations, an attacker could potentially learn sensitive information related to cryptographic keys or other secrets.
- Compromised cryptographic operations: The vulnerability compromises the security of cryptographic operations that rely on the modular exponentiation routine.

**Attack vectors:**
- Timing analysis: An attacker needs to be able to measure the time it takes for the vulnerable `mpi_powm()` function to execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Timing measurement capability: The attacker must be able to measure the execution time of the vulnerable function with sufficient precision. This might be achieved via local access or remote timing attacks.
- Knowledge of the algorithm: It is beneficial, but not strictly required, that the attacker knows which cryptographic functions and algorithms use modular exponentiation

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both GnuPG and Libgcrypt, as they both use the vulnerable `mpi_powm()` implementation.
- The fix involves mitigating the data-dependent timing variations. The provided documents mention that the fix for this is related to "Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks are Practical," but don't specifically describe how it was fixed.
- Both GnuPG 1.4.19 and Libgcrypt 1.6.3 address this vulnerability.
