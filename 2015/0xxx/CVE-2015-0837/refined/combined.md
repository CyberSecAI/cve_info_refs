Package        : gnupg
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3591 CVE-2015-0837 CVE-2015-1606

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:

CVE-2014-3591

    The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.

CVE-2015-0837

    The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.

CVE-2015-1606

    The keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet
    types not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory
    already freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (crash) via crafted keyring files.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.18-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.

```
Hello!

We are pleased to announce the availability of a new GnuPG classic
release: Version 1.4.19.  This release mitigates two new side channel
attacks.

Updating any GnuPG 1.4 version to 1.4.19 is suggested!

To update a GnuPG 2.0 or 2.1 version you need to update the shared
library Libgcrypt to version 1.6.3.

What is GnuPG
=============

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a complete and free implementation of
the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC-4880 and better known as PGP.

GnuPG, also known as GPG, allows to encrypt and sign data and
communication, features a versatile key management system as well as
access modules for public key directories.  GnuPG itself is a command
line tool with features for easy integration with other applications.
A wealth of frontend applications and libraries making use of GnuPG
are available.

GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.

Three different versions of GnuPG are actively maintained:

- GnuPG "modern" (2.1) is the latest development with a lot of new
  features.

- GnuPG "stable" (2.0) is the current stable version for general use.
  This is what most users are currently using.

- GnuPG "classic" (1.4) is the old standalone version which is most
  suitable for older or embedded platforms.  This announcement is about
  a release of this version.

You may not install "modern" (2.1) and "stable" (2.0) at the same
time.  However, it is possible to install "classic" (1.4) along with
any of the other versions.

What's New in GnuPG 1.4.19
==========================

 * Use ciphertext blinding for Elgamal decryption [CVE-2014-3591].
   See <http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp/> for details.

 * Fixed data-dependent timing variations in modular exponentiation
   [related to CVE-2015-0837, Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks
   are Practical].

 * Detect faulty use of --verify on detached signatures.

 * Changed the PKA method to use CERT records and hashed names.

 * New import option "keep-ownertrust".

 * Support algorithm names when generating keys using the --command-fd
   method.

 * Updated many translations.

 * Updated build system.

 * Fixed a regression in keyserver import

 * Fixed argument parsing for option --debug-level.

 * Fixed DoS based on bogus and overlong key packets.

 * Fixed bugs related to bogus keyrings.

 * The usual minor minor bug fixes.

Getting the Software
====================

Please follow the instructions found at <https://gnupg.org/download/> or
read on:

GnuPG 1.4.19 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found
at <https://gnupg.org/mirrors.html> .  Note that GnuPG is not available
at ftp.gnu.org.

On ftp.gnupg.org you find these files:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2  (3627k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2.sig

This is the GnuPG 1.4.19 source code compressed using BZIP2 and its
OpenPGP signature.

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz  (5020k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz.sig

This is the same GnuPG 1.4.19 source code compressed using GZIP and its
OpenPGP signature.

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe (1586k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe.sig

This is GnuPG 1.4.19 compiled for Microsoft Windows and its OpenPGP
signature.  This is a command line only version; the source files are
the same as above.  Note, that this is a minimal installer and unless
you are only in need for the simple the gpg binary, you are better off
using the full featured installer at <https://www.gpg4win.org> .

Checking the Integrity
======================

In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:

 * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply
   verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature
   of the file gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2 you would use this command:

     gpg --verify gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See below for information on the signing keys.

 * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2, you would run the command like this:

     sha1sum gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:

5503f7faa0a0e84450838706a67621546241ca50  gnupg-1.4.19.tar.bz2
d0cf40cc42ce057d7d747908ec21a973a423a508  gnupg-1.4.19.tar.gz
dc03ae4e4c3e8fe0583b37dd6c3124f94246d2f8  gnupg-w32cli-1.4.19.exe

Release Signing Keys
====================

To guarantee that a downloaded GnuPG version has not been tampered by
malicious entities we provide signature files for all tarballs and
binary versions.  The keys are also signed by the long term keys of
their respective owners.  Current releases are signed by one or more
of these four keys:

  2048R/4F25E3B6 2011-01-12 [expires: 2019-12-31]
  Key fingerprint = D869 2123 C406 5DEA 5E0F  3AB5 249B 39D2 4F25 E3B6
  Werner Koch (dist sig)

  rsa2048/E0856959 2014-10-29 [expires: 2019-12-31]
  Key fingerprint = 46CC 7308 65BB 5C78 EBAB  ADCF 0437 6F3E E085 6959
  David Shaw (GnuPG Release Signing Key) <dshaw 'at' jabberwocky.com>

  rsa2048/33BD3F06 2014-10-29 [expires: 2016-10-28]
  Key fingerprint = 031E C253 6E58 0D8E A286  A9F2 2071 B08A 33BD 3F06
  NIIBE Yutaka (GnuPG Release Key) <gniibe 'at' fsij.org>

  rsa2048/7EFD60D9 2014-10-19 [expires: 2020-12-31]
  Key fingerprint = D238 EA65 D64C 67ED 4C30  73F2 8A86 1B1C 7EFD 60D9
  Werner Koch (Release Signing Key)

You may retrieve these files from the keyservers using this command

  gpg --recv-keys 249B39D24F25E3B6 04376F3EE0856959 \
                  2071B08A33BD3F06 8A861B1C7EFD60D9

The keys are also available at <https://gnupg.org/signature_key.html> .
Note that this mail has been signed using my standard PGP key.

requests we keep a list of known service companies at:

  <https://gnupg.org/service.html>

If you are a developer and you may need a certain feature for your
project, please do not hesitate to bring it to the gnupg-devel mailing
list for discussion.

Thanks
======

We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the
servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing
lists.

Since the start of the funding campaign in December several thousand
people have been kind enough to donate a total of 250000 Euro to support
this project.  In addition the Linux Foundation gave a grant of $ 60000
for 2015, Stripe.com and Facebook.com each pledged $ 50000 per year.

I am amazed by this superb and unexpected support for the GnuPG project.
This does not only allow us to continue the project and allowed to hire
second full time developer, but also gives the resources to improve
things which have been delayed for too long.

*Thank you all !*

Salam-Shalom,

   Werner

# [Announce] Libgcrypt 1.6.3 released (with SCA fix)

**Werner Koch**
wk at gnupg.org

```
Hello!

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.6.3.  This is a security fix release to mitigate two new side
channel attacks.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building blocks.
It does not provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.
Thorough understanding of applied cryptography is required for proper
use Libgcrypt.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.6.3
===================================

 * Use ciphertext blinding for Elgamal decryption [CVE-2014-3591].
   See <http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/radioexp/> for details.

 * Fixed data-dependent timing variations in modular exponentiation
   [related to CVE-2015-0837, Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks
   are Practical].

 * Improved asm support for older toolchains.

Download
========

Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as listed
at <http://www.gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html> .  On the primary server
the source tarball and its digital signature are:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2 (2436k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2.sig

That file is bzip2 compressed.  A gzip compressed version is here:

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.gz (2893k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.gz.sig

In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you are going to build
is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of the following
ways:

 * Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:

     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2.sig libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.  You
   should see a message indicating that the signature is good and made
   by one of the release signing keys.
   See <https://gnupg.org/signature_key.html> .

 * If you are not able to use GnuPG, you have to verify the SHA-1
   checksum:

     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:

9456e7b64db9df8360a1407a38c8c958da80bbf1  libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.bz2
4d56b5d754d39acae239f876537672e1dc8298e3  libgcrypt-1.6.3.tar.gz

Copying
=======

Libgcrypt is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPLv2.1+).  The helper programs as well as the
documentation are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPLv2+).  The file LICENSES has notices about contributions
that require these additional notices are distributed.

Support
=======

For help on developing with Libgcrypt you should read the included
manual and optional ask on the gcrypt-devel mailing list [1].  A
listing with commercial support offers for Libgcrypt and related
software is available at the GnuPG web site [2].

If you are a developer and you may need a certain feature for your
project, please do not hesitate to bring it to the gcrypt-devel mailing
list for discussion.

Thanks
======

We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the
servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing
lists.  Niibe Yutaka did most of the work on fixing the side channel
attacks.  Special thanks to
 a) Daniel Genkin and his team for working with us on the fix for the
    "radioexp" attack,
 b) Yuval Yarum and its team for advance information on their new cache
    attack and sample code on how to fix it.

Since the start of the GnuPG funding campaign in December several
thousand people have been kind enough to donate a total of 250000 Euro
to support this project.  In addition the Linux Foundation gave a grant
of $ 60000 for 2015, Stripe.com and Facebook.com each pledged $ 50000
per year.

I am amazed by this superb and unexpected support for the GnuPG project.
This will not only allow us to continue the project and hire a second
full time developer but gives us also the resources to improve things
which have been delayed for too long.

*Thank you all !*

Happy hacking,

  Werner
