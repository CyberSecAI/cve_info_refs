The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-009. One of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2015-0069.

**CVE-2015-0069**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer not properly using the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. This allows an attacker to predict memory offsets of specific instructions, bypassing ASLR.

*   **Weakness:** Improper implementation of ASLR.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass ASLR, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution vulnerabilities. This bypass doesn't allow arbitrary code execution by itself, but it makes it more reliable. The impact is rated as "Important" for Windows clients and "Low" for Windows servers. The impact is information disclosure because an attacker could obtain information about the memory layout to assist in exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a user browsing a specially crafted website while logged on using an affected version of Internet Explorer.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to host a malicious website and convince a user to visit it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. The attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content, and would have to convince users to take action, like clicking a link.

*   **Affected Software:** Internet Explorer 10 and 11 are affected. Specifically:
    *   Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit and x64), Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT.
    *   Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit and x64), Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1.
