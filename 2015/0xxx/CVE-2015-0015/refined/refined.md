- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how Network Policy Servers (NPS) parse username queries during RADIUS authentication. Specifically, it appears the parsing of specially crafted username strings could trigger the issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the RADIUS implementation of the Network Policy Server. The vulnerability is triggered by the way NPS handles specially crafted username strings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, preventing RADIUS authentication on the affected IAS or NPS. This could cause the target system to stop responding, disrupting network services.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted username strings to an IAS or NPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the IAS or NPS and does not require prior authentication. Network Policy Servers that allow remote, untrusted users to authenticate are at particular risk.
