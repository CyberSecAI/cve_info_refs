## Vulnerability in Network Policy Server RADIUS Implementation Could Cause Denial of Service (3014029)

Published: January 13, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow denial of service on an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Network Policy Server (NPS) if an attacker sends specially crafted username strings to the IAS or NPS. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights; however, it could prevent RADIUS authentication on the IAS or NPS.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008 (excluding Itanium), Windows Server 2008 R2 (excluding Itanium), Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing how Network Policy Servers parse username queries when implementing RADIUS. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3014029](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3014029).

## Vulnerability Information

## Network Policy Server RADIUS Implementation Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0015

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could send specially crafted username strings to an Internet Authentication Service ([IAS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx)) or Network Policy Server ([NPS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx)), causing a denial of service condition for [RADIUS](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) authentication on the IAS or NPS. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights; however, it could prevent RADIUS authentication on the IAS or NPS. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the target system to stop responding. Network Policy Servers that allow remote, untrusted users to authenticate are at particular risk from this vulnerability. The update addresses the denial of service vulnerability by changing how Network Policy Servers parse username queries when implementing RADIUS.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
