Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0796:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the `applylink` function of the open build service (obs-server) backend when applying patches defined in a `_link` file. This lack of proper validation allows for the creation of symbolic links that point outside the intended directory and the modification of arbitrary files within the source repository. Additionally, it allows access to files from packages where source access is disabled through a similar mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Modification:** By crafting a malicious patch (specifically a `symlinks.diff` file) containing symlinks, an attacker could redirect file writes to arbitrary files within the source repository. This is achieved by creating symlinks within the temporary patch directory that point to files outside that directory which are then modified during patch application. The `topadd` function writes content to the path pointed to by the symlinks
2.  **Source Access Bypass:**  A user could gain access to files from packages with disabled source access by crafting a `createlink.diff` file which creates a link to the protected package and then expanding the sources to bypass the access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** An attacker could modify critical files, such as spec files or revision metadata (`*.rev` files), leading to:
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Malicious code could be injected into packages by modifying their spec files or source code. This could result in the distribution of compromised packages to users, potentially causing widespread harm.
    *   **Build Manipulation:** By modifying revision metadata, an attacker could trigger builds of modified packages, potentially deploying malicious code or configurations to production systems.
*   **Source Access Bypass:**  An attacker could retrieve the contents of files from packages where source access was intentionally disabled, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious `_link` File:** The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious `_link` file within a user-controlled package. This `_link` file specifies the patches to apply.
2.  **Crafted Patches:** The `_link` file references specially crafted patch files:
    *   **`symlinks.diff` (for arbitrary file modification):** Creates symbolic links to files outside the intended patch directory and uses the `topadd` feature to modify the linked files.
    *    **`createlink.diff` (for source access bypass):**  Creates a link to a package where source access is disabled.
3.  **Committing the Malicious Changes:** The attacker needs to commit the malicious `_link` file and patch files to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:**  The attacker needs a user account on the Open Build Service.
*   **Package Creation Rights:** The attacker needs the ability to create and commit changes to packages within the build service.
*   **Knowledge of the System:** In the case of arbitrary file modification, some knowledge of the server's process IDs might be needed to more accurately target the symlinks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report details two specific attack strategies, one for arbitrary file modification, and one for source access bypass.
*   The vulnerability exists because the `applylink` function does not properly validate the output of the patch command, and it allows the creation of symlinks and files outside the temporary directory for patches, failing to verify if the target is a regular file, and it doesn't check permissions before expanding a link.
*   The provided patch (and a later fix by Michael) addresses the vulnerability by adding additional checks to ensure that patches don't create symlinks and that files are within the correct directory. It also restricts the ability to modify the  `_link` file through patching. It also adds a check on the result of the patch command
*   The bug was fixed in versions 2.6.3, 2.5.7, and 2.4.8 of the open build service.
