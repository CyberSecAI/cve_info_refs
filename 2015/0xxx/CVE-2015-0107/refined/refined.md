- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Directory Traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to files and directories on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A) with medium complexity (AC:M) and requires authentication (Au:S).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have authenticated access to the adjacent network.
