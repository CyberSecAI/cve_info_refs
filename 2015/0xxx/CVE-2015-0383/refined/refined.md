{
  "CVE-2015-0383": {
    "Description": "Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack.",
    "Root cause": "The Hotspot component of OpenJDK creates temporary files for performance statistics and error logs without proper checks on file permissions and ownership. It does not properly sanitize path names of these files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file handling",
      "Missing ownership check",
      "Symlink vulnerability",
	  "Path traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local attackers can potentially overwrite or remove arbitrary files with the permissions of the victim user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local file system",
	  "Symlink creation"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local access to the system to create symlinks in the hsperfdata directory."
  }
