Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper handling of a search query within IBM Content Collector for Email when used with IBM FileNet P8 systems configured with IBM Content Search Services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the improper processing of specific search query operators. This allows a local attacker to bypass access controls.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by specific query operators, implying that the application does not sufficiently validate or sanitize user-provided inputs used in queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A local attacker can gain unauthorized access to documents that the logged-on user is normally not authorized to view. This leads to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is local.
*   The attacker must be a logged-on user, indicating they must already have some level of access to the system.
*   The attack vector is via crafting specific search queries to exploit the improper query handling mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have local access to the system where IBM Content Collector for Email is running.
*   The attacker must have an active user account on the system.
*   The attacker must have some knowledge of the vulnerable query operators.
