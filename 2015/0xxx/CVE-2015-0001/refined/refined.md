Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Windows Error Reporting (WER) interacts with processes that are protected by "Protected Process Light."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the "Protected Process Light" security feature, which is designed to prevent debugging and memory access of critical system processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Access:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain access to the memory of a running process that is protected by "Protected Process Light." This allows the attacker to potentially view sensitive information, including credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access with administrator privileges is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid logon credentials.
- The attacker must be able to log on locally to the system with administrative privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- "Protected Process Light" is designed as a defense-in-depth measure to mitigate attacks by malicious users who have already gained administrative access, preventing further lateral attacks.
- The security update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how WER interacts with these protected processes.
- There are no identified workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The update was reoffered on July 14, 2015 for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 systems to provide additional defense-in-depth measures.
