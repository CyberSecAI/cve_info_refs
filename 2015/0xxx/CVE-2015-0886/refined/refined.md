{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the key stretching process within the crypt_raw method.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow when the log_rounds parameter is set to 31. This leads to a calculation of rounds as a negative number, effectively resulting in zero rounds of key stretching."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability significantly weakens the password hashing process, making it easier for attackers to recover passwords through brute force attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attackers who obtain the password hash value."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to obtain the password hash value, which could be through network access or other means."

  "affected_versions": [

  ],
    "patches": [
    "jBCrypt-0.4"
  ],
  "cve": "CVE-2015-0886",
  "more_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to using a signed integer to calculate the number of rounds. When the log_rounds parameter is set to 31, the left shift operation results in a negative number. The loop that performs key stretching then doesn't run. The fix involves changing the rounds variable to a long type."
