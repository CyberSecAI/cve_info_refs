Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0360:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2015-0360 is a memory corruption vulnerability within Adobe Flash Player. The specific flaw lies in how Flash Player handles certain operations, leading to memory being corrupted during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability. This means that the program is writing data to the wrong memory locations, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The memory corruption could also lead to application crashes, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious SWF content. Attackers can craft specially designed SWF files that trigger the memory corruption vulnerability when loaded by a vulnerable Flash Player. This could be achieved by hosting the malicious SWF file on a website or embedding it into advertisements.
- Unspecified vectors: The official description notes "unspecified vectors," suggesting that the precise attack methods might not be fully documented or could include multiple techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** An attacker doesn't need local access to the target machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to deliver malicious SWF content:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to load the malicious SWF file, such as by hosting it on a website or sending it via phishing attacks.
- No authentication required.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Flash Player versions before 13.0.0.281, 14.x through 17.x before 17.0.0.169 on Windows and OS X, and before 11.2.202.457 on Linux.
