- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ReST renderer in django-markupfield did not disable the `..raw` directive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of a directive in the ReST renderer, specifically the `..raw` directive, which allows inclusion of arbitrary files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can include arbitrary files. This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on how the included files are handled.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting ReST markup containing the `..raw` directive when using the affected django-markupfield.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable ReST renderer in django-markupfield. This likely involves having the ability to submit content that contains ReST markup through the application.
