|  | |

The about:reader page can be opened from an unprivileged context, accepting any protocol in the "url" parameter. If parsing of the target document fails, the browser will eventually redirect to the specified URL.
Therefore, this link will redirect to the XUL document without any user interaction:
about:reader?url=chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
If a javascript: link is given, the script executes when the user tries to close the reader view (navigate back to the "original page"):
about:reader?url=javascript:alert(document.location)
The JS payload then evaluates in the about:reader context (which does not have chrome privileges).

We only try parsing http/https/file URIs:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/reader/ReaderMode.jsm?force=1#231>
But yeah, what you're seeing here is that if we fail to parse the URI, we load the original URL that was passed in:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/reader/AboutReader.jsm?force=1#576>
about:reader runs with content privileges, but AboutReader.jsm has chrome privileges, so we do have to be more careful.
A scheme check sounds like the right call to me.
(FYI, this issue also affects mobile, and is something we ship right now.)

Isn't allowing the file: scheme already a SOP violation?
Also, relying on a protocol whitelist might still produce some security-relevant bugs. For instance, the malware/phishing warning will be bypassed (on desktop):
about:reader?url=<http://www.itisatrap.org/firefox/its-an-attack.html>

Yeah, we need a scheme check there. There's no valid use case for reader-ing non-http schemes, AFAIK.

It's only a "same origin" violation if a web page can get at the contents of a file:// window or frame. We prevent file:// loads mostly so that in case we have a SOP-violation bug attackers can't easily use it to steal sensitive files off your disk.
While we don't want to allow a \_web\_ page to specify a file: scheme I can see it would be useful for reader mode to support it to read articles that have been downloaded locally. I don't know if that's why we allow it here, though. I'd be more than happy to give up that (uncommon?) case if necessary to stop web pages from being able to trigger file: loads.

A scheme check for loading should usually be the last choice because it scatters security decisions across the tree and they can easily end up inconsistent with each other. Any chance you could use nsIScriptSecurityManager::CheckLoadURIWithPrincipal() (or CheckLoadURIStrWithPrincipal)?

Yes, we added this in [bug 1044781](/show_bug.cgi?id=1044781 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow Reading List to store and display arbitrary URLs").
It's probably too late to try to uplift this to 36, but we'd definitely want the fix in 37.tracking-fennec: 38+ → 37+

These return values aren't used anywhere, and you don't return true below, so should these be void returns?

Add a security scheme check before loading URLs from about:reader
I think ideally we would error out much earlier (e.g. in the "what URL am I handling?" code), so that we don't even do anything to process non-http[s] URIs at all, rather than isolating the restriction to \_loadOriginalUrl.
I think we should be more restrictive than checkLoadURI and just check for schemeIs(http) || schemeIs(https).
If we do that we may need to make matching adjustments to the "when to show reader view button" to ensure we don't offer it when we know it won't work.

This doesn't totally work, since we would have to take extra measures to hide/disable the "close reader view" button. I also realized that as long as we show an about:reader page for one of these unsupported URLs, the reader toolbar button is also susceptible to this problem (the close reader view logic for that button is similar, but implemented elsewhere).

We already restrict this to http/https/file URIs, but we can remove support for file URIs, since I assume that was just added for local testing, but it's easy enough to run a local web server to test.

Attached patch

[Alternate patch: just bail if about:reader is loaded with a bogus URL](attachment.cgi?id=8584226&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1147597&attachment=8584226)

There is a lot of distributed logic, especially in Fennec, that makes assumptions about things if we're currently on an about:reader page. To avoid needing to add more logic to fix this all over the place, I think we should just get away from the about:reader page if we have a bad URL.
What do you think of this approach?

Ah, I didn't think through where we were in the release process, it's fine to wait. But if we end up with a re-spin, I think this could be a possible ride-along.

Although this is not directly exploitable I'm going to go ahead and call this sec-high rather than the usual sec-moderate because it's one SOP violation or client UI XSS from from a sec-critical code exploit.

I'm going to leave this open until we land a fix to make this non-linkable, since even with this fix a user could click on an about:reader link that will open a malicious http/https URL.Whiteboard: [leave open]

I'm confused, users can click on links that directly open a malicious http/https URL, too, right? Can you provide more detail about what attack vector you're talking about?

I didn't test this myself, but as I interpreted the comments above, opening a malicious link through about:reader this way would avoid the safe browsing service, which would be more dangerous than a user clicking that malicious URL directly. Is that correct?
Is may also be worth considering the fact that it's hard to tell what URL is going to be loaded when clicking a malicious about:reader URL, so it may be harder for users to realize that they don't actually trust the link (although that assumes users are actually paying attention to URLs).

Making about:reader unlinkable is a belt-and-suspenders fix to prevent other possible abuses of the privileged nature of ReaderMode.jsm. There's no valid use case for people linking to about:reader URIs, so it makes sense to just prevent it.Flags: needinfo?(gavin.sharp)

Remove URI\_SAFE\_FOR\_UNTRUSTED\_CONTENT from <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/da2f28836843/browser/components/about/AboutRedirector.cpp#l121>.
Except then you'll run into the issue described in <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/da2f28836843/browser/components/about/AboutRedirector.cpp#l27>.
We should probably fix that, which expands the scope, and probably requires some changes to nsAboutProtocolHandler.cpp's newURI logic and adding another flag to nsIAboutModule.Flags: needinfo?(gavin.sharp)

Yes, I think we would prefer this be linkable than be privileged ([bug 778582](/show_bug.cgi?id=778582 "RESOLVED FIXED - reader mode chrome xss")). It's unfortunate if there's no simple way to do this right now :(
Maybe we should try to have this redirection happen in our unprivleged aboutReader.js instead of in the privileged AboutReader.jsm? I think it would be possible to do that by listening for/firing a special event on the page. Would that ensure the safebrowsing service takes effect?

Considering the comment Gavin linked to already predicts that we'd run into this issue, I think I'd prefer to fix it there, but we should probably do this in a separate bug? Seems like we could essentially add a flag to mean "don't let content link to this" and add it to about:reader and file a bug investigating if any other content-safe pages want it - shouldn't be toooo hard? We normally take interface changes for aurora, and considering this is the first week of beta we might be able to take it there? We might also not need to break binary compat (if we're only adding a flag, I think that shouldn't affect things?).

That sounds like the right plan. Adding a flag has no binary compat impact.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-43

## Loading privileged content through Reader mode

Announced
April 3, 2015
Reporter
Armin Ebert
Impact
High
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 37.0.1

### Description

Security researcher **Armin Ebert** reported a flaw in
`Reader mode` on Firefox for Android. Reader mode reformats web
content for easy readability and operates as unprivileged content that is the
equivalent of the formatted content. When Reader mode is unable to process
content, it displays the original web pages. Since it is unprivileged, there are
no restrictions on pages linking to or framing Reader mode content. The reported
flaw is that privileged URLs can be passed to Reader mode and bypass the normal
restrictions that prevent web pages from obtaining references to privileged
contexts. If this issue was combined with another flaw that allowed for a
violation of the same-origin policy, then the resulting combination could lead
to arbitrary code execution.

This flaw only affects Firefox for Android and pre-release
versions of Desktop Firefox. The released version of desktop Firefox does not
have reader mode and is not affected.

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
