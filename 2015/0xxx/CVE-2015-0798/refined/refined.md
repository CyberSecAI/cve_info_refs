Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0798:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `about:reader` page in Mozilla Firefox handles URLs. Specifically, when the reader mode fails to parse the content of a provided URL, it redirects the browser to the original URL that was passed as a parameter.  The `about:reader` page can be opened from an unprivileged context, and it was not correctly validating the scheme of the provided URL parameter, which could be any protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The `about:reader` page, which runs with content privileges, could be tricked into loading privileged URLs (like `chrome://` or `javascript:` URIs) due to the lack of scheme validation, resulting in a violation of the Same-Origin Policy and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** The use of `about:reader` with a malicious URL could potentially bypass security mechanisms like the safe browsing service.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `about:reader` page did not properly validate the URL schemes, allowing for potentially malicious protocols to be passed as URL parameters and later loaded if the initial parsing failed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If combined with another vulnerability, this flaw could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** Attackers could bypass security measures by loading malicious content through `about:reader`.
*   **Phishing:** It could be used in phishing attacks, as a malicious `about:reader` URL could be crafted to load malicious content, and users would have difficulty verifying that URL.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A user could be tricked into clicking a crafted link to `about:reader` with a malicious URL as a parameter.
*   A malicious website could open an `about:reader` page with a malicious URL as a parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes a malicious or privileged scheme that can be passed as a parameter to `about:reader`.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the crafted link, or cause the browser to load the malicious link directly.

**Additional details from bug report:**

*   The bug was initially reported by Armin Ebert.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox for Android and pre-release versions of Desktop Firefox where the reader mode was enabled.
*   The fix involved preventing the `about:reader` page from loading URLs with non-http/https schemes and redirecting back to the original page when such a URL was provided.
*   A follow-up bug was created to make `about:reader` un-linkable, to further prevent potential abuses of the reader mode.
*   The severity of the bug was considered "sec-high" because it was a step away from a sec-critical code exploit and because it could have been a stand-in for another exploit in a previous Pwn2Own exploit.
*   The initial fix to check the scheme was deemed insufficient. A decision was made to just bail if `about:reader` is loaded with a bogus URL.
*   The fix landed in Firefox 37.0.1 as a ride-along patch.
*  The file scheme was initially supported, but then removed as not necessary since a local web server can be used for testing purposes.
