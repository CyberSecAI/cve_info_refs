- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An undisclosed security vulnerability in IBM Rational Team Concert.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described, but it would likely involve injecting malicious script into a field or parameter in the application that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable application. The specific means and requirements are not detailed in this document.
