  "CVE-2015-0833": {
    "description": "Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in updater.exe in Mozilla Firefox before 36.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.5, and Thunderbird before 31.5 on Windows, when the Maintenance Service is not used, allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in (1) the current working directory or (2) a temporary directory, as demonstrated by bcrypt.dll.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The updater.exe in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird loads DLL files from the working directory or temporary directories when the Maintenance Service is not used, which is an insecure practice.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Untrusted search path vulnerability",
        "DLL hijacking"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation. An attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the updater.exe will load it.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local file system",
         "DLL injection"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system, the ability to write files in the updater's working or temporary directory, and the ability to modify the Firefox/Thunderbird configuration to disable the maintenance service."
