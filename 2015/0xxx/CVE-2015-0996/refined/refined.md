Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0996, though the provided information relates to multiple vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2015-0996**

*   **Root Cause:** Sensitive information within project files and project configuration files is protected using a hard-coded, cleartext password.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The use of a hard-coded password to protect sensitive data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in project files and configuration files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Vulnerabilities (Not CVE-2015-0996, but found in the same advisory)**

The documents also describe three other related vulnerabilities that are not specifically CVE-2015-0996:

1.  **User Enumeration**
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** When connecting to a server from the HMI, available user names are displayed, allowing for brute force attacks.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for user account compromise via brute-force attacks
    *    **Attack Vectors:** Adjacent network access is required
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to exploit this vulnerability.
2. **Cleartext Transmission of User Credentials**
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** User credentials are sent in cleartext
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Malicious actors can gain access to the control system.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Adjacent network access is required
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to exploit this vulnerability.
3.  **Cleartext Storage of OPC Credentials**
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  OPC user credentials stored in a configuration file in cleartext.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker with access to the configuration file can obtain OPC credentials.
     *   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   Schneider Electric InTouch Machine Edition 2014, version 7.1.3.2 and all previous versions.
*   Schneider Electric InduSoft Web Studio, version 7.1.3.2 and all previous versions.

**Mitigation:**

*   Schneider Electric has released patches for both products.
    *   InTouch Machine Edition 2014: Version 7.1.3.4, Service Pack 3, Patch 4
    *   InduSoft Web Studio: Version 7.1.3.4, Service Pack 3, Patch 4
*   General recommendations:
    *   Minimize network exposure of control systems.
    *   Isolate control system networks from business networks using firewalls.
    *   Use secure methods like VPNs for remote access, ensuring VPNs are updated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Public exploits may exist for these vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities are considered relatively easy to exploit, requiring low skill level.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Gleb Gritsai, Alisa Esage Shevchenko, and team from Positive Technologies.
