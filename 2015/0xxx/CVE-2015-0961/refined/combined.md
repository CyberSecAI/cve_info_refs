## Barracuda Web Filter insecurely performs SSL inspection

#### Vulnerability Note VU#534407

Original Release Date: 2015-04-28 | Last Revised: 2015-04-28

---

### Overview

Barracuda Web Filter prior to version 8.1.0.005 does not properly check upstream certificate validity when performing SSL inspection, and delivers one of three default root CA certificates across multiple machines for SSL inspection.

### Description

| According to [Barracuda Networks](https://www.barracuda.com/products/webfilter), the Barracuda Web Filter is a "comprehensive solution for web security and management" with many features, including the ability to provide "visibility into SSL-encrypted traffic". This SSL inspection feature of the Barracuda Web Filter is vulnerable to multiple issues.  **Incomplete validation of upstream certificate validity - CVE-2015-0961**Barracuda Web Filter versions between 7.0 and 8.1.0.005 do not check upstream certificate validity when performing SSL inspection. **Shared root CA certificate - CVE-2015-0962**Barracuda Web Filter versions between 7.0 and 8.1.0.005 ship one of three different default certificates that are shared across multiple machine for use in the SSL Inspection feature.       Users who have configured SSL Inspection on a Barracuda Web Filter may be affected. Beginning in version 8.1.0.005, Barracuda Web Filter verifies certificate validity and generates a unique default certificate for each appliance.Barracuda Networks has released a [security advisory](http://cuda.co/15076) with more details. For more information on the impact of these issues on SSL inspection, please see Will Dormann's [CERT/CC blog post](https://www.cert.org/blogs/certcc/post.cfm?EntryID=221) on SSL Inspection.The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-0962. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The impact of either CVE-2015-0961 or CVE-2015-0962 may allow an attacker to successfully achieve a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack without the client knowing it. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update the firmware**Barracuda Networks has released firmware version 8.1.0.005 on April 16th, 2015 to address these issues. Affected users should upgrade to firmware 8.1.0.005 or later as soon as possible.Users who have deployed an affected service using the default certificate supplied with the appliance will need to deploy a new client certificate to their clients and remove the previously deployed certificate. Instructions for deploying and removing client certificates are available at <http://techlib.barracuda.com/BWF/UpdateSSLCerts>.**Check that old shared certificates are removed**Barracuda has also provided [https://certcheck.barracudalabs.com](https://certcheck.barracudalabs.com/), a site that will show users if their browser trusts any of the shared default certificates and includes instructions for removing the certificates from the browser trust store if necessary. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
