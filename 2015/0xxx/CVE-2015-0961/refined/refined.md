Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Barracuda Web Filter's failure to properly validate the validity of upstream certificates when performing SSL inspection. This means that the web filter does not verify if the server certificate presented by the upstream server is trusted or legitimate, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete validation of upstream certificate validity:** The Barracuda Web Filter does not properly check the validity of certificates from upstream servers during SSL inspection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack without the client's knowledge. By intercepting and modifying the traffic, they can potentially steal sensitive information, inject malicious content, or redirect the user to a fake website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Traffic Interception:** An attacker positioned in the network path between the client and the server can intercept traffic and present a fraudulent certificate to the Barracuda Web Filter, which it will then blindly trust.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Positioning:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker would also need to have a valid certificate for the target domain in order to successfully impersonate the server.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2015-0962, which involves the use of shared root CA certificates. The provided document notes that the CVSS score is based on CVE-2015-0962.
- Barracuda has released a firmware update to address this vulnerability.
