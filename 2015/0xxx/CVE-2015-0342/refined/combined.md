[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0697)

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes multiple security issues
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB15-05
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2015-0332, CVE-2015-0333, CVE-2015-0335, CVE-2015-0339,
CVE-2015-0334, CVE-2015-0336, CVE-2015-0338, CVE-2015-0341, CVE-2015-0342)

This update also fixes a cross-domain policy bypass flaw and a file upload
restriction bypass flaw. (CVE-2015-0337, CVE-2015-0340)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.451.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-12 15:15:51 UTC  ``` Announcement is not you yet up... <https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-05.html>  But <https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html> says  3/12/2015 – Updated debugger and standalone versions of Flash player. These versions contain fixes for critical vulnerabilities identified in Security Bulletin APSB 15-05. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c1)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-03-12 15:26:30 UTC  ``` Should I wait for CVE numbers or should I submit it now? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c2)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-12 15:45:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Stanislav Brabec from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c1)) > Should I wait for CVE numbers or should I submit it now?  Let's wait until the upstream annoucement is available. I'll clear the needinfo when it arrives. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-12 15:55:50 UTC  ``` APSB15-04 - Security updates for Adobe Flash Player  CVE list from <http://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses/vulnerabilities/VET-000697.aspx>  CVE-2015-0313 CVE-2015-0314 CVE-2015-0315 CVE-2015-0316 CVE-2015-0317 CVE-2015-0318 CVE-2015-0319 CVE-2015-0320 CVE-2015-0321 CVE-2015-0322 CVE-2015-0323 CVE-2015-0324 CVE-2015-0325 CVE-2015-0326 CVE-2015-0327 CVE-2015-0328 CVE-2015-0329 CVE-2015-0330 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c4)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-03-12 16:37:00 UTC  ``` home:sbrabec:branches:multimedia:apps: created request id 290463 (auto-accepting and forwarding) openSUSE:Factory:NonFree: New request # 290465 openSUSE:Maintenance: Using target project 'openSUSE:Maintenance' 290466 SUSE:SLE-12:Update: Using target project 'SUSE:Maintenance' 53130 SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update:Test: created request id 53132  Report created by 6-flash-player-update-submit-all.sh.   Please review these request carefully. It is my first run of auto-update scripts on a real issue. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c6)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-03-12 16:54:41 UTC  ``` I just noticed that Adobe added a directory LGPL with LGPL.txt and notice.txt to all tarbals.  notice.txt: This product links to certain Linux system libraries licensed under LGPL.  Should we do anything with it? I guess that no. It is valid for all our packages. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-12 18:37:02 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started. This issue was rated as critical. Please submit fixed packages until 2015-03-16. When done, reassign the bug to security-team@suse.de. <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/61095> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c8)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-03-12 18:45:55 UTC  ``` <https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-04.html> was finally created. CVE list does not match, APSB15-04 additionally lists CVE-2015-0331.  Re-submiting everything again:  home:sbrabec:branches:multimedia:apps: created request id 290480 (going to auto-accept) openSUSE:Factory:NonFree: New request # 290481 openSUSE:Maintenance: Using target project 'openSUSE:Maintenance' 290482 SUSE:SLE-12:Update: Using target project 'SUSE:Maintenance' 53136 SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update:Test: created request id 53138  Report created by 6-flash-player-update-submit-all.sh.   OBS maintenance request 290466 was already accepted, I cannot supersede it. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2015-03-12 19:04:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Stanislav Brabec from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c8)) Unfortunately that's not the only problem. Those are the CVEs of the last flash update. The correct CVEs are: - Memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution (CVE-2016-0332, CVE-2015-0333, CVE-2015-0335, CVE-2015-0339). - Type confusion vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution (CVE-2015-0334, CVE-2015-0336). - A vulnerability that could lead to a cross-domain policy bypass (CVE-2015-0337). - A vulnerability that could lead to a file upload restriction bypass (CVE-2015-0340). - An integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to code execution (CVE-2015-0338). - Use-after-free vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution (CVE-2015-0341, CVE-2015-0342).  I'm sorry, but you'll need to resubmit everything. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c10)  Stanislav Brabec   2015-03-12 20:23:06 UTC  ``` Adobe first took the old advisory, and later fixed CVE list.  I see that last update missed CVE-2015-0331. Adding it to the previous changes entry.  And fixing CVE-2016-0332 => CVE-2016-0332.   home:sbrabec:branches:multimedia:apps: created request id 290490 (going to auto-accept) openSUSE:Factory:NonFree: New request # 290491 openSUSE:Maintenance: Using target project 'openSUSE:Maintenance' 290492 SUSE:SLE-12:Update: Using target project 'SUSE:Maintenance' 53140 SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update:Test: created request id 53142 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-13 11:04:59 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0490-1: An update that fixes 11 vulnerabilities is now available.

Because of that all updates reference the 2016 CVE in the text, the update for SLE 12 and openSUSE also in the metadata :( ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=922033#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-13 17:05:01 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2015:0493-1: An update that fixes 11 vulnerabilities is now available.
