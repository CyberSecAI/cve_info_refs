| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.0 |

"text": "Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) is a feature of Cisco IOS, which allows intelligent automatic device management by introducing self-management concepts that simplify network management for the network operator. The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure feature simplifies the network bootstrap functionality by removing the need for any kind of prestaging, thereby, allowing devices to join a domain securely, after which devices can be configured.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Registration Authority Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to spoof an Autonomic Networking Registration Authority (ANRA) response.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of an Autonomic Networking (AN) response message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bootstrap a device into an untrusted autonomic domain, gaining limited command and control of the AN node, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition and disrupting access to the legitimate autonomic domain.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62191 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62191\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0635.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Infrastructure Spoofed Autonomic Networking Messages Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition disrupting access to the autonomic domain from a specific Autonomic Networking (AN) node.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an overloaded AN message which can reset the finite state machine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof an existing AN node. An exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt access to the autonomic domain from the spoofed node.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62293 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62293\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0636.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Infrastructure Device Reload Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of received Autonomic Networking (AN) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof the target device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an affected system to reload and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62315 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62315\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0637."

Affected Products  * The following Cisco IOS devices with Autonomic Networking Support are affected by these vulnerabilities:   + Cisco ASR 901, 901S, and 903 Series Aggregation Services Routers   + Cisco ME 3600, 3600X, and 3800X Series Ethernet Access Switches   Vulnerable ProductsDevices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software are vulnerable if the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure feature is enabled on the device.      To check if a device is running autonomic networking, an administrator can check the running configuration for the **autonomic** command.      **show run | include autonomic**      If there is no output, or the **no autonomic** command is found, that device is not vulnerable.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.      Cisco IOS NX-OS Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) is a feature of Cisco IOS, which allows intelligent automatic device management by introducing self-management concepts that simplify network management for the network operator. The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure feature simplifies the network bootstrap functionality by removing the need for any kind of prestaging, thereby, allowing devices to join a domain securely, after which devices can be configured.      **Autonomic Networking Registration Authority Spoofing Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to spoof an Autonomic Networking Registration Authority (ANRA) response.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of an Autonomic Networking (AN) response message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bootstrap a device into an untrusted autonomic domain, gaining limited command and control of the AN node, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition and disrupting access to the legitimate autonomic domain.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCup62191](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62191) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0635.      **Autonomic Networking Infrastructure Spoofed Autonomic Networking Messages Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition disrupting access to the autonomic domain from a specific Autonomic Networking (AN) node.      The vulnerability is due to an overloaded AN message which can reset the finite state machine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof an existing AN node. An exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt access to the autonomic domain from the spoofed node.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCup62293](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62293) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0636.      **Autonomic Networking Infrastructure Device Reload Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of received Autonomic Networking (AN) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof the target device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an affected system to reload and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCup62315](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62315) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0637.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds or mitigations available for the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.         Cisco IOS Software Cisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication The tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.
