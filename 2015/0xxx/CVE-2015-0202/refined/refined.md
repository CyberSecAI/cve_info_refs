  "CVE-2015-0202": {
    "status": "Relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The mod_dav_svn server in Subversion versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 has a vulnerability due to how it caches DAG nodes when processing REPORT requests. The cache does not deallocate nodes in a timely manner leading to excessive memory usage.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper resource management",
        "Unbounded memory allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the server's memory, potentially leading to crashing the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends a large number of specially crafted REPORT requests to the Subversion server.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Subversion server. No authentication is needed if the repository allows anonymous reads."
    }
  },
  "CVE-2015-0251": {
    "status": "Relevant",
     "details": {
      "root_cause": "The mod_dav_svn server in Subversion versions 1.5.0 through 1.7.19 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 incorrectly handles crafted v1 HTTP protocol request sequences.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "HTTP request handling vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote authenticated user can spoof the svn:author property.",
       "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends crafted v1 HTTP protocol request sequences to the server.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user."

  "CVE-2015-0248": {
    "status": "Relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The mod_dav_svn and svnserve servers in Subversion versions 1.6.0 through 1.7.19 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.11 are vulnerable to a denial of service due to improper handling of dynamically evaluated revision numbers.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Denial of service vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an assertion failure, leading to the server aborting/crashing.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends specially crafted requests with specific parameter combinations to the Subversion server.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated if the repository allows anonymous reads."
