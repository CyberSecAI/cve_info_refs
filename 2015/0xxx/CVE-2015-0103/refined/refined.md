Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-0103

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input retrieved from the database within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Process Portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a persistent XSS vulnerability. Malicious script injected into data fields is stored and later executed when other users view this data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary script into data fields, which is then executed in the browsers of other users who view that data.
*   **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** The injected script could potentially be used to steal sensitive information, manipulate data, or perform unauthorized actions within the context of the affected user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Data Field Injection:** An authenticated user injects malicious script into data fields.
*   **Retrieval and Rendering:**  The injected script is retrieved from the database and executed when other users display the affected data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the IBM Business Process Manager.
*  **Access to Data Fields:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify data fields within the application.
