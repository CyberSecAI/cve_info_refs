Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Saurus CMS Community Edition. These vulnerabilities arise due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The provided commit details that both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities were present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of websites
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Theft of sensitive information
    *   Further attacks on the user's system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without requiring local access to the server.
*   **Medium Complexity:** The vulnerability has a medium access complexity. This suggests that successful exploitation may require some manipulation or specific conditions to be met. However, no authentication is required, implying that the exploit can be conducted without logging into the application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Knowledge of Input Vectors:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input vectors in the application, where unsanitized user-supplied data is processed.
*  **No Authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from the provided resources:**

*   The vulnerability affects Saurus CMS Community Edition versions prior to 4.7 (released on 04.02.2015)
*   The fix involved multiple commits on GitHub:
    *   `1bc2728`: Addressed stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities by sanitizing user input using `htmlspecialchars` and `xss_clean` functions.
    *    `a583106`: Updated SWFUpload to a more secure version.
    *   `cea4417`: Removed outdated Flowplayer library and plugin.
*   The fix specifically uses  `htmlspecialchars` and `xss_clean` to sanitize input.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yuji Tounai of NTT Com Security.
