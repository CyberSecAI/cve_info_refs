Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-0917 (Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the advisory ID SROEADV-2015-01 and the commit link match the patch for this CVE.)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the "action" parameter in the admin.php file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "action" parameter before embedding it in the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This could be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the webpage.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is the "action" parameter in the URL.  An attacker crafts a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `action` parameter and tricks a victim into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and get victims to access them (e.g. via a link in an email, or a link on a website).
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, the crafted link is sent to an authenticated admin user.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided code diff shows that the fix implemented in the class `class_abstract_controller.php` was to use the function `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the `strAction` parameter to prevent reflected XSS.

* The vulnerability was found by Steffen RÃ¶semann.
* The vendor (Kajona) was informed and released a fix.
* The vulnerable version is Kajona v4.6.
* The fix is available in the linked commit.
