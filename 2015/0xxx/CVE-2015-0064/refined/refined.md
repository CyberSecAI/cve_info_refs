Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-0064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Word improperly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This improper handling can corrupt system memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The core issue is that the malformed file causes memory corruption within the Microsoft Word application during parsing.
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The exploit-db content indicates that the vulnerability can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow due to an invalid size being used in a pointer calculation, leading to an oversized memcpy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: An attacker can send a specially crafted malicious file to the user via email and convince them to open it.
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host the crafted file on a website and trick the user into visiting the site and opening the file. The attacker can leverage compromised websites that accept or host user-provided content.
- Preview pane is explicitly noted as NOT an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted malicious Office file.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file, either through email or by visiting a compromised website.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a more technical description of the root cause, mentioning an invalid size used in a pointer calculation which leads to a buffer overflow.
- The `exploit-db` entry also mentions the possibility of an arbitrary free from later usage of controlled pointers in the destination buffer.
- The issue affects Microsoft Word 2007, 2010, and other related applications, as indicated in the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-012.
