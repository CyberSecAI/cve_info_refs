## ShareLaTeX vulnerable to remote command execution and information disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#302668

Original Release Date: 2015-03-03 | Last Revised: 2015-03-03

---

### Overview

ShareLaTeX is a server-based software allowing group collaboration on LaTeX documents. ShareLaTeX prior to version 0.1.3 has been found to be vulnerable to command injections and information disclosure.

### Description

| [**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** **-** CVE-2015-0933  ShareLaTeX 0.1.3 and previous versions allow a remote user to obtain information about other users or the server on which ShareLaTeX is installed by allowing a user to \include{} any valid absolute path name in the document, which is then forwarded to the latex process. When processed, the output document will contain the contents of the file specified.[**CWE-77**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') -** CVE-2015-0934ShareLaTeX prior to version 0.1.3 allows a remote user to run commands on the server with the permissions of the ShareLaTeX process by not properly filtering out backticks from the names of files.The CVSS score below is based on CVE-2015-0934. |
| --- |

### Impact

| CVE-2015-0933 allows a remote authenticated user to obtain information about other users or the server on which ShareLaTeX is installed. This information can include information like user accounts, which may be used to mount further attacks against the server.CVE-2015-0934 allows a remote authenticated user to run commands on the server with the permissions of the ShareLaTeX process.Note that user authentication as of ShareLaTeX 0.1.3 is currently limited to registering an email address and does not require moderator/administrator approval. Therefore it is possible for an authenticated user to remain anonymous. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**CVE-2015-0934 was addressed in CLSI 0.1.3, which is included in [ShareLaTeX 0.1.3](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex). Users are recommended to update as soon as possible. This update does not address CVE-2015-0933, however. You may consider the following workaround for CVE-2015-0933. |
| --- |

| **Change LaTeX configuration**CVE-2015-0933 may be mitigated by making some changes to the LaTeX configuration file on the server running ShareLaTeX. ShareLaTeX provides some [extra security guidance](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki/Production-Installation-Instructions#securing-latex). |

Figure 1: A screenshot of a project being edited in Overleaf Community Edition.

## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](/overleaf/overleaf/blob/main/server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](/overleaf/overleaf/blob/main/server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or "community") image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.
