Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0934:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ShareLaTeX application not properly sanitizing or filtering backticks (` `) from filenames. When processing LaTeX documents, the application passes these filenames to the underlying LaTeX engine. The LaTeX engine, in turn, interprets backticks as command execution instructions, which leads to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The primary weakness is the improper handling of special characters, specifically backticks, in filenames. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying system through the LaTeX compilation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** A remote, authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the same permissions as the ShareLaTeX process. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or disrupt service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **LaTeX Document:** The attack vector is a specially crafted LaTeX document that includes backticks within the filename included using commands such as `\include{}` or similar. When the server processes this malicious document, it will execute the injected command on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ShareLaTeX server.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ShareLaTeX application, although user authentication is described as simple as email registration and no moderator approval is required, which means attacker can easily register.
