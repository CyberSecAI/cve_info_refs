Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from `tardiff` using predictable temporary directories when unpacking tarballs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable temporary directory creation:**  The tool creates temporary directories using a predictable pattern, making it easier for attackers to guess the directory location.
- **File Overwriting:** Due to the predictable path, an attacker can exploit this weakness to overwrite existing files with the permissions of the user running the `tardiff` command line tool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A malicious user can overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the permissions of the user running the tardiff command.
- **Privilege Escalation (potentially):** If an attacker can overwrite a file used by an administrator or a system service this could lead to privilege escalation or disruption of system services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Tar File:** An attacker creates a specially crafted tar file.
- **Predictable Path:** The attacker leverages the predictable temporary directory creation to target specific files to overwrite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system where `tardiff` is being executed.
- **Ability to Create and Use Malicious Tar Files:** The attacker must have the technical skills to create a malicious tar file.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to know which files are targetable based on the execution context of `tardiff`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `tardiff` tool.
- The fix involves preventing the use of predictable temporary directories.
- This was addressed in Debian by version `0.1-2+deb8u2` for the stable release (jessie) and version `0.1-5` (and partially in earlier versions) for the unstable release (sid).
- The advisory mentions it was discovered by Florian Weimer
