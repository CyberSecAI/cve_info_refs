Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to the BACnet OPC Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122):**  The application has a flaw in handling memory allocation, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   **Crash:** Causing the BACnet OPC Server to terminate unexpectedly.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allowing the attacker to execute malicious code on the affected system, potentially gaining control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted network packet to the BACnet OPC Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the BACnet OPC Server. The document suggests the attacker skill level required to exploit this vulnerability is low.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability exists in the SOAP web interface within the Windows service of the product.
*   A CVSS v2 base score of 8.3 was assigned to this vulnerability with a vector of (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C).
