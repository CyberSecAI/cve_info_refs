| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

Only Typhoon-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco ASR 9000 Series Routers with Typhoon-based line cards are affected by this vulnerability. To be affected by this vulnerability, the device must be configured to route traffic via the BVI and must also have any of the following features configured: uRPF, PBR, QoS, or ACLs.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets that are further routed via BVI. IPv6 packets, or IPv4 packets directed to an affected device, cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      By default BVI, uRPF, PBR, QoS, and ACLs are not enabled in Cisco IOS XR Software.      To determine whether BVI is configured on a device, use the **show running-config | include bvi** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **interface bvi** in the output of **show running-config | include bvi** indicates that BVI is configured.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include bvi** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the BVI configured:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include bvi interface bvi 50   ``` To determine whether uRPF is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include verify** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **ipv4 verify unicast source reachable-via rx** in the output of **show running-config | include verify** indicates that uRPF is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include "verify source"** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the uRPF feature enabled:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include "verify source" ipv4 verify unicast source reachable-via rx   ```    To determine whether PBR is configured on a device, use the **show running-config policy-map | include pbr** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **policy-map type pbr** in the output of **show running-config policy-map | include pbr** indicates that PBR is configured.      The following is the output of the **show running-config policy-map | include pbr** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the PBR feature enabled:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config policy-map | include pbr policy-map type pbr TEST_PBR   ``` To determine whether ACLs are enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include access-group** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **ipv4 access-group** in the output of **show running-config | include access-group** indicates that ACLs are configured.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include access-group** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the ACL feature enabled:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include access-group ipv4 access-group TEST_IN ingress   ```    To determine whether QoS is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include service-policy** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **service-policy input** or **service-policy output** in the output of **show running-config | include service-policy** indicates that QoS is configured.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include service-policy** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the QoS feature configured:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include service-policy service-policy input test_in service-policy output test_out   ```       The second generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards is referred to as Typhoon-based line cards. The term comes from the network processors (NPs) that are used on these line cards.      The following line cards are Typhoon based:   + A9K-MOD80-SE   + A9K-MOD80-TR   + A9K-MOD160-SE   + A9K-MOD160-TR   + A9K-24X10GE-SE   + A9K-24X10GE-TR   + A9K-36X10GE-SE   + A9K-36X10GE-TR   + A9K-2X100GE-SE   + A9K-2X100GE-TR   + A9K-1X100GE-SE   + A9K-1X100GE-TR   To determine whether the line card on an ASR 9000 Series Router is Typhoon based, the administrator can use the **show diag** command. Affected devices will include the product ID (PID) for at least one of the Typhoon-based cards. The following example shows a device on which an A9K-24X10GE-SE card is active:        ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show diagMon Jun 22 12:55:10.554 PSTNODE module 0/RSP0/CPU0 :   MAIN:  board type 0x100302!--- output truncatedNODE module 0/1/CPU0 :    MAIN:  board type 0x20207  S/N:   FOC123081J6  Top Assy.

Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers with Typhoon-based line cards are affected by this vulnerability.   Cisco ASR 9001 and Cisco ASR 9001-S Routers are affected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Releases of Cisco IOS XR Software prior to 4.3.1 are not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers with Trident-based line cards are not affected by this vulnerability. The first generation of the ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards is often referred to as Trident-based line cards.      The following line cards are Trident based:   + A9K-40GE-L   + A9K-40GE-B   + A9K-40GE-E   + A9K-4T-L   + A9K-4T-B   + A9K-4T-E   + A9K-8T/4-L   + A9K-8T/4-B   + A9K-8T/4-E   + A9K-2T20GE-L   + A9K-2T20GE-B   + A9K-2T20GE-E   + A9K-8T-L   + A9K-8T-B   + A9K-8T-E   + A9K-16T/8-B   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the packet-processing code of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and the line card that is processing traffic. Only Typhoon-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of packets that are routed via the bridge-group virtual interface (BVI) when any of the following features are configured: Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), policy-based routing (PBR), quality of service (QoS), or access control lists (ACLs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv4 packets through an affected device that is configured to route them via the BVI interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and the line card that is processing traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.      To be affected by this vulnerability, the device must be configured to route traffic via the BVI and must also have any of the following features configured: uRPF, PBR, QoS, or ACLs.      This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCur62957](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur62957) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0695.
