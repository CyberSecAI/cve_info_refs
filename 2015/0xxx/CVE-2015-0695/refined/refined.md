Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of packets routed via the Bridge-Group Virtual Interface (BVI) in Cisco IOS XR Software. This occurs when specific features like Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), policy-based routing (PBR), quality of service (QoS), or access control lists (ACLs) are also configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-  Improper packet processing when routing traffic via BVI and when uRPF, PBR, QoS, or ACLs are enabled.
- The vulnerability exists in the packet processing code of the Cisco IOS XR Software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit can lead to a lockup and subsequent reload of the network processor chip and the line card that is processing the traffic.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker sends IPv4 packets through an affected device which is configured to route them via BVI interface.
- Only IPv4 packets routed via BVI can trigger the vulnerability; IPv6 packets or IPv4 packets destined for the affected device cannot be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an affected Cisco ASR 9000 Series router.
- The router must have a Typhoon-based line card.
- The router needs to be configured to route traffic via a BVI interface.
- At least one of the following features must be configured on the affected router: uRPF, PBR, QoS, or ACLs.

**Additional Details:**

- Only Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers with Typhoon-based line cards are affected.
- Cisco ASR 9001 and Cisco ASR 9001-S Routers are also affected.
- Releases prior to Cisco IOS XR Software 4.3.1 are not affected.
- The vulnerability is identified by Cisco bug ID CSCur62957.
- There are no workarounds. The solution requires applying a software maintenance update (SMU).
