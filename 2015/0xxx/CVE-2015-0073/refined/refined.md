Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Windows Registry Virtualization improperly allows a user to modify the virtual store of another user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the virtual store by Windows Registry Virtualization, allowing unauthorized modification.
- Failure to restrict user access to other users' virtual registry stores.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can run arbitrary code with the security context of another user logged on to the affected system.
- **Full System Compromise:** Once elevated, an attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts potentially with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials to the system.
- **Exploitation via Application:**  The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to log on to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to processes using Registry Virtualization, which is enabled for:
    - 32-bit interactive processes
    - Keys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software
    - Keys that an administrator can write to
- Registry Virtualization is disabled for:
    - 64-bit non-interactive processes (like services)
    - Processes impersonating a user
    - Kernel-mode processes (drivers)
    - Processes with requestedExecutionLevel in manifests
    - Specific registry keys like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows, and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT.
