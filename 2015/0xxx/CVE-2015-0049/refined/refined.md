The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS15-009) detailing security updates for Internet Explorer, which includes information on CVE-2015-0049.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability, specifically when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory leading to arbitrary code execution.
- ASLR bypass vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not use Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.
- Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions, potentially allowing scripts to be run with elevated privileges
- Information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
- **Security Feature Bypass (SFB):** Attackers can bypass the ASLR security feature, making it easier to predict memory offsets and exploit other vulnerabilities.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Attackers can elevate privileges, running scripts with higher permissions than they would normally have, which is often used in conjunction with another vulnerability like RCE.
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** Attackers can gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone due to improper cross-domain policy enforcement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted websites. Attackers could host these websites or inject malicious content into compromised sites or sites accepting user-provided content.
- Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website (e.g., via phishing, malicious links).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to host or control content on a website and lure victims into viewing it.
-  Attackers need to have knowledge of the specific memory corruption vulnerabilities, and how to exploit them.
- For ASLR bypass, the attacker needs to be able to reliably predict memory offsets.
- For EoP the attacker needs to combine this with another exploit, typically RCE.
- For information disclosure, the attacker needs to be able to exploit the cross domain policy violations.

**CVE-2015-0049 Specific Information:**
- This specific vulnerability is a memory corruption issue leading to potential remote code execution, impacting Internet Explorer 8, and 10.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
