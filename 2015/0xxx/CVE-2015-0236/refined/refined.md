Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `virDomainSnapshotGetXMLDesc()` and `virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc()` functions in libvirt did not properly enforce access control list (ACL) checks when the `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag was used. These functions allowed access to sensitive information, specifically the VNC password, when fine-grained ACLs were enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient ACL checks:** The core issue is the missing or inadequate ACL check in the mentioned functions when the `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag is used, while it is present for `virDomainGetXMLDesc`
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability allowed a remote, authenticated attacker with a 'read' ACL privilege to potentially bypass restrictions and access information (VNC passwords) that should be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** A remote, authenticated attacker with a connection to `libvirtd` and the 'read' ACL privilege could obtain sensitive information (specifically, the VNC password) from a domain's XML file.
- **Security Bypass:** The vulnerability allowed a bypass of intended access controls by exploiting the snapshot or save image functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote access:** The attack vector is remote, requiring a connection to the `libvirtd` daemon.
- **Authenticated attacker:** The attacker needs to have established an authenticated connection to `libvirtd`.
- **ACL bypass through functions:** The attacker leverages the `virDomainSnapshotGetXMLDesc()` or `virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc()` functions with the `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access to libvirtd:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the `libvirtd` daemon.
- **Valid credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate with `libvirtd`.
- **'domain:read' ACL privilege:** The attacker must have the 'read' ACL privilege, but *not* the 'domain:secure_read' privilege, to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Snapshot or Save image:** A snapshot or save image for the domain must exist for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "low" severity by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability is related to how libvirt handles the `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Luyao Huang of Red Hat.
*   The content also mentions that the leak is only possible with fine-grained ACLs and if a snapshot or save image exist. Also that using SPICE connections is a recommended practice as it avoids this issue and provides better features than VNC
