Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the IBM Process Portal not properly validating user-supplied input. Specifically, the portal might execute a script embedded within error messages received from other sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. The system fails to sanitize error messages from external sources, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary scripts in a user's web browser within the security context of the hosting website.
*   Potentially steal a user's cookie-based authentication credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL containing a script. This URL, when clicked by a user, could cause the script to execute within the Process Portal. The script would be executed due to an error message from another source that contains the malicious code, causing the portal to run the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL containing a script.
*   The attacker must trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL.
*  The attacker needs to be able to send error messages to the vulnerable system that contain malicious scripts.

**Affected Products:**
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
*   IBM BPM Standard
*   IBM BPM Express

The vulnerability affects versions 8.0.x and 8.5.x of the above products.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is available as interim fix JR50607.
*   The fix is also included in JR50162 on IBM Business Process Manager 8.5.0.1.
*   The issue was initially reported on 2014-06-24 and closed on 2015-03-12
