The provided content relates to CVE-2015-0968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload of a file with a dangerous type.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application allows uploading of active content like JSP pages via the /searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html endpoint. By manipulating the Content-Type header to "image/jpeg" during the upload, an attacker can bypass file type restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by visiting the uploaded content, leading to potential full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Unauthenticated access to the upload endpoint.
- Manipulation of the `Content-Type` header during the upload process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to access the upload endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to use a client proxy or similar tool to modify the `Content-Type` header of the upload request.
