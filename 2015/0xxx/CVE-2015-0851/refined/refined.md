Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `xmltooling` C++ XML parsing library's failure to properly handle exceptions when parsing well-formed but schema-invalid XML. Specifically, an uncaught exception occurs when processing such XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncaught Exception:** The primary vulnerability is an uncaught exception within the `xmltooling` library when processing XML that is syntactically correct but violates the defined schema.
- **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The library does not gracefully handle schema validation errors, leading to a crash instead of a controlled error or rejection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the application using the `xmltooling` library, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by an attacker.
- **Crafted XML Data:** The attack vector involves supplying well-formed but schema-invalid XML data to the vulnerable application. This XML data can be included in SAML metadata or SAML protocol messages, if applicable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Send XML:** The attacker needs the ability to send or inject specially crafted XML data to the vulnerable application or service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects applications that utilize the `xmltooling` C++ library for XML parsing.
- Shibboleth Service Provider software is specifically mentioned as being affected.
- The vulnerability is corrected in `xmltooling` versions 1.4.2-5+deb7u1 (wheezy), 1.5.3-2+deb8u1 (jessie) and 1.5.5
- A partial mitigation can be achieved by enforcing schema validation, but this may lead to interoperability issues with systems that do not fully adhere to the schema.
