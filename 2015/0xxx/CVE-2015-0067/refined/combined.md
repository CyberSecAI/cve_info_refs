## Security Update for Internet Explorer (3034682)

Published: February 10, 2015 | Updated: March 4, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and forty privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer, by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature, and by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3034682](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3034682).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0054](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0054) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0055](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0055) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. The vulnerabilities would have to be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit any of these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerabilities

Security feature bypass vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could bypass the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use a ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0051](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0051) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0069](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0069) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0071](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0071) | No | Yes |

## Internet Explorer Cross-domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0070

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, which could allow an attacker to gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.
