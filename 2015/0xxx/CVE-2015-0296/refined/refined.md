Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in a pre-install scriptlet within the `texlive-base` RPM package. This scriptlet contains commands that, when executed, can lead to arbitrary file deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Script Execution:** The pre-install script executes commands that include `rm -rf` and `find` within user-controlled directories (specifically, the user's home directory).
*   **Unrestricted File Removal:** The script searches for `.texlive*` directories within `/home/*/` and then removes files matching `*.fmt`. This provides a means to delete arbitrary files if a malicious user creates a directory matching this pattern and places files with the `.fmt` extension within.
*   **Privileged Execution:** The preinstall script runs with elevated privileges, inheriting the permissions of the package manager, meaning that when the `texlive-base` package is updated, the malicious commands execute as a privileged user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An unprivileged user can delete arbitrary files on the system by creating specifically named directories and files within their home directory.
*   **System Instability:** Deleting critical system files could lead to system instability or failure, although not explicitly mentioned as the primary impact in the provided text. The primary concern is the arbitrary deletion of user files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker needs only a local user account on the system to create malicious files in their home directory.
*   **Package Update Trigger:** The attack is triggered when the `texlive-base` package is updated (or installed), causing the vulnerable pre-install script to be executed by the package manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the system where the vulnerable `texlive-base` package is installed.
*   **Ability to Create Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create directories and files in their home directory.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to ensure malicious files are in place when the vulnerable `texlive-base` package is updated via package management.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by the package manager executing the pre-install script during package installation or upgrades.
*   The issue is described as a flaw in the pre-install script, making it a vulnerability related to the way the package executes commands during installation or updates.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in specific versions of `texlive` packages in Fedora 20 and 21 by a patch mentioned in the bug report.
