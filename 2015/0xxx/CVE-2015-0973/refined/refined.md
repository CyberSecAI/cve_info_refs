  "CVE-2015-0973": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate libpng. Libpng versions prior to 1.5.21 and 1.6.x prior to 1.6.16 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `png_read_IDAT_data` function due to missing checks on image width during IDAT chunk reading. This occurs in libpng versions prior to 1.5.21 and 1.6.x prior to 1.6.16.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing checks on image width",
       "Inadequate input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:\n- Disclosure of sensitive information\n- Addition or modification of data\n- Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Maliciously crafted PNG files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send or make a system process a specially crafted PNG file with a large width value.",
     "additional_details": [
      "This CVE was assigned to the overflow issue in `png_read_IDAT_data/png_handle_IHDR`, separate from CVE-2014-9495 which relates to `png_combine_row`.",
        "The issue can be triggered when processing PNG images with widths greater than what the library was designed to handle."
