Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0783:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `FileViewer` class of Novell Zenworks.
*   The root cause is the failure to sanitize the "filename" variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain access to sensitive information on vulnerable Novell Zenworks installations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the vulnerable system.
*   The specific method involves manipulating the "filename" variable, likely through a network request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a *remote* user, meaning they must have network access to the vulnerable system.
*   The vulnerability does *not* require user interaction to exploit, potentially allowing for automated attacks.
*   The advisory notes the attacker needs to be a *authenticated* user, which adds a constraint compared to unauthenticated exploits.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-01-15 and a patch was released by Novell.
*   The affected versions of ZCM include: ZCM 11.2.4, ZCM 11.2.4 MU1, ZCM 11.3.0, ZCM 11.3.0 FRU1, ZCM 11.3.1, ZCM 11.3.1 FRU1, ZCM 11.3.2, ZCM 11.3.2 FRU1.
*   This advisory provides more detail than the generic CVE description, including the vulnerable class (`FileViewer`), the root cause (lack of sanitization of `filename`), and the authentication requirement.
