  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Apache Qpid broker improperly handles specific AMQP protocol sequences which leads to a denial of service.",

      "Improper input validation for range in a sequence set",

      "Sending specific AMQP protocol messages which have invalid ranges in sequence sets",
