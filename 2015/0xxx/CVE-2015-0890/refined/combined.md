# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

## FAQ

### How to get reCaptcha keys?

Follow the next steps in order to get and enable reCaptcha protection using the official Google Captcha keys:

1. Open your WordPress admin dashboard.

2. Navigate to the plugin Settings page.

3. Click the “Get the API Keys” link.

4. Enter your domain name and click “Create Key” button.

5. You will see your public and private keys. Copy them and paste to the appropriate fields on plugin Settings page.

6. Save changes.

### How to hide reCaptcha in Comments for registered users?

You should go to the Settings page and select the roles, for which you want to hide reCaptcha. Then you must click “Save Changes” button.

### Is it possible to Change the appearance and style of the reCaptcha?

Follow the next steps in order to change the appearance of the reCaptcha:

1. Open your WordPress admin dashboard.

2. Navigate to the plugin Settings page.

3. Select reCAPTCHA version.

4. Find the “Theme” option (only available for versions 1 and 2) and select the necessary style from the drop-down list.

5. Save changes and check the result.

### reCaptcha not displayed on my comment form. Why?

You might have a theme where “comments.php” is coded incorrectly. WordPress version matters.

(WP2 series): Make sure that you theme contains a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file /wp-content/themes/[your\_theme]/comments.php.

Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment text area, you can move it up if it is below the comment text area.

(WP3 series): WP3 has a new function comment\_form inside of /wp-includes/comment-template.php.

Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from “comments.php”.

WP3 theme does not need the code line do\_action(‘comment\_form’… inside of /wp-content/themes/[your\_theme]/comments.php.

Instead it uses a new function call inside of “comments.php”: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`

If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`

inside of /wp-content/themes/[your\_theme]/comments.php (please check the Twenty Ten theme’s “comments.php” for proper example).

### How can I change the location of reCaptcha in the comments form?

It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works (‘after\_comment\_field’ or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call. Please find the file ‘comments.php’ in the theme and change position of the line

```
do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );

```

or any similar line – place it under the Submit button.

In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

### Add reCaptcha plugin to a custom form on your WordPress website

Follow the instructions below in order to add reCaptcha plugin to your custom PHP or HTML form:

1. Install the reCaptcha plugin and activate it.

2. (Optional) If you would like to have an ability to enable and disable the reCAPTCHA for your custom form on the plugin settings page, please add the following code to the ‘functions.php’ file of your theme:

```
function add_custom_recaptcha_forms( $forms ) {
    $forms['my_custom_form'] = array( "form_name" => "Custom Form Name" );
    return $forms;
}
add_filter( 'gglcptch_add_custom_form', 'add_custom_recaptcha_forms' );

```

In this example, ‘my\_custom\_form’ is a slug of your custom form.

Please don’t use the following form slugs since they are predefined by plugin settings: login\_form, registration\_form, reset\_pwd\_form, comments\_form, contact\_form, cf7, si\_contact\_form, jetpack\_contact\_form, sbscrbr, bbpress\_new\_topic\_form, bbpress\_reply\_form, buddypress\_register, buddypress\_comments, buddypress\_group, woocommerce\_login, woocommerce\_register, woocommerce\_lost\_password, woocommerce\_checkout, wpforo\_login\_form, wpforo\_register\_form, wpforo\_new\_topic\_form, wpforo\_reply\_form.

– Save file changes;

– Go to the “Settings” tab on the plugin settings page (Admin Dashboard -> reCaptcha); If everything is OK, you will see your form in ‘Enable reCAPTCHA for’ => ‘Custom Forms’ (with labels which you specified in the “gglcptch\_add\_custom\_form” hook call function).

– Enable it and configure form options as you need;

– Click “Save Changes” button;

If you don’t add this code, no option for your custom form will be displayed on the plugin settings page and the reCAPTCHA will be always displayed in your custom form.

1. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add reCAPTCHA);
2. Find a place to insert the code for the reCAPTCHA output;

   If you completed the instructions in p. 2, then you should add:

In this example, the second parameter is a slug of your custom form.

Otherwise, insert the following line:

```
<?php echo apply_filters( 'gglcptch_display_recaptcha', '' ); ?>

```

1. After that, you should add the following lines to the function of the entered data checking.

   If you completed the instructions in p. 2, then you should add:

In this example, the third parameter is a slug of your custom form.

Otherwise, insert the following lines:

```
<?php $check_result = apply_filters( 'gglcptch_verify_recaptcha', true, 'string' );
if ( true === $check_result ) { /* the reCAPTCHA answer is right */
    /* do necessary action */
} else { /* the reCAPTCHA answer is wrong or there are some other errors */
    echo $check_result; /* display the error message or do other necessary actions in case when the reCAPTCHA test was failed */
} ?>

```

If there is a variable in the check function responsible for the errors output, you can concatenate variable $check\_result to this variable. If the ‘gglcptch\_verify\_recaptcha’ filter hook returns ‘true’, it means that you have entered the reCAPTCHA answer properly. In all other cases, the function will return the string with the error message.

If you have followed all steps, but the problem remains, we can help you to configure your reCaptcha custom form. This will be a paid service since there are a lot of different custom forms and the code should be inserted individually into each of them, so we need some time to study each unique case.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

– The link to the page where the problem occurs

– The name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.

Once I got it working it proved to be excellent. I needed help from the support team though as I am a bit of a coding dummy. Anastasia in particular was helpful and prompt – thank you!I recommend that BestWebSoft have step-by-step instruction videos to help people like me.Regards Andy

No support for CF7 which is the most popular form plugin in the free version. This plugin is mostly useless and bloated.
