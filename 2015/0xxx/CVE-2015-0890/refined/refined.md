Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) plugin by BestWebSoft for WordPress. The plugin does not properly validate the CAPTCHA response, allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-254: Security Features:** The core weakness is a failure to implement a necessary security mechanism, specifically the proper validation of the CAPTCHA response. This falls under the broader category of "Improper access control", since the reCAPTCHA is intended to control access to user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the CAPTCHA protection.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This enables the attacker to login to WordPress without correct credentials, and gain administrative privileges which could lead to any of the following:
    *   Full control of the WordPress site.
    *   Malicious actions, such as content modification, data theft, or malware injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. An attacker does not need local network or local system access.
*   **Target:** The attack is directed at the WordPress login functionality protected by the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the WordPress instance.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware that the target website is using the vulnerable plugin and version.
*  **No Authentication needed:** The attacker doesn't need valid account credentials to be able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.12 and earlier of the Google Captcha (reCAPTCHA) plugin by BestWebSoft.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-254 by JVN iPedia. However, the IPA evaluation maps this to "CWE-Other" indicating it does not fully map into the subset of CWE used by JVN iPedia.
