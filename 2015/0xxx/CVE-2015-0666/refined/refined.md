Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0666:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of path information supplied to the `fmserver` servlet within Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw (CWE-22). This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied path information, allowing attackers to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory.
* **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation on path inputs provided to the `fmserver` servlet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the underlying operating system.
* **Data Confidentiality Breach:** This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on the server, potentially including system files, configuration data, and other confidential documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, via network access.
* **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required, allowing any network-accessible attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Directory Traversal Payload:** An attacker crafts a malicious request including directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the file path parameter to access arbitrary file system locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system running Cisco Prime DCNM.
* **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP requests to send the malicious payload.
* **File Read Permissions:** The attacker will be able to read files readable by the 'System' user in Windows or 'root' user in Linux.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Prime DCNM releases 6.3(1) and later, prior to release 7.1(1), on both Windows and Linux platforms are affected.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco DCNM software version 7.1(1).
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4, indicating a high severity.
*   **Exploitation in the wild:**  There has been attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.
*   **Reporting:** This vulnerability was reported by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
