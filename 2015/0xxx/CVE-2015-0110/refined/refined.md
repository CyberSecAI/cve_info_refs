- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of access restrictions when invoking services using the `executeServiceByName` URL. Specifically, there was no check based on the service type, which allowed authenticated users to access services intended for internal use only.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The system allowed access to internal services through an exposed URL, without proper authorization checks.
    - **Lack of access control:** There was no restriction based on the service type when invoking services via the `executeServiceByName` URL, allowing access to internal services.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Exposure of internal services to authenticated users. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications, data leaks, or other security issues, depending on the functionality of those services.
    - The ability to start System Tasks or User Tasks that were not intended to be exposed to the user via undocumented URLs.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Exploitation is through the `executeServiceByName` URL.
    - Attackers need to be authenticated users.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the system.
    - The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and the name of the internal service to be executed.
