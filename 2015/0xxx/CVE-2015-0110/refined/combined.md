To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: Internal service types can be invoked in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) Process Portal (CVE-2015-0110)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

When invoking a service using the executeServiceByName URL, there is no access restriction based on the service type and services that were meant for internal use only are available for authenticated users.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:**Â [CVE-2015-0110](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0110)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM Business Process Manager Standard V7.5.x, 8.0.x, 8.5.x
* IBM Business Process Manager Express V7.5.x, 8.0.x, 8.5.x
* IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V7.5.x, 8.0.x, 8.5.x
* WebSphere Lombardi Edition 7.2.x

If you are using an earlier unsupported version, IBM strongly recommends to upgrade.

## Remediation/Fixes

Install the interim fix for APAR JR52126 as appropriate for your current IBM Business Process Manager or IT06189 for your current WebSphere Lombardi Edition environment.

* [IBM Business Process Manager Express](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Express&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR52126)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Standard](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Standard&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR52126)
* [IBM Business Process Manager Advanced](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Business+Process+Manager+Advanced&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=JR52126)
* [WebSphere Lombardi Edition](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Lombardi+Edition&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=IT06189)

Before this fix, a user could start System Tasks or User Tasks that were not exposed to this user via undocumented URLs.

The new functionality is:

"With URLs it is possible,

* to start Human Services that are exposed to the logged-on user
* to start Ajax Services.

Execution of other service types is rejected, unless

* the request arrives on the Process Center and
* the request was issued by Process Designer in a playback session and
* the user that issued this request is a member of the tw\_authors group and
* the user is granted Read access to the process app.

If this behaviour conflicts with existing solutions, it is possible to disable the new checks.

To do this, add

<server merge="mergeChildren">

<web-workflow-manager merge="mergeChildren">

<enforce-correct-service-type-for-execute-service-by-name>false</enforce-correct-service-type-for-execute-service-by-name>

</web-workflow-manager>

</server>

to 100Custom.xml
