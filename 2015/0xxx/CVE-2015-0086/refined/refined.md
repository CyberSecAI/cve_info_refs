- **Preview Pane:** The preview pane can be used as an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted RTF file to the victim.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Office handles files in memory.
- There are no identified mitigations or workarounds beyond applying the security update.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Microsoft Office products and versions, including Word, Office Web Apps, and SharePoint Server components, as detailed in the "Affected Software" sections of the provided document.
