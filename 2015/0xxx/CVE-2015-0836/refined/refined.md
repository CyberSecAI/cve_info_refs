Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0836:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this CVE is the presence of multiple unspecified memory safety vulnerabilities within the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. These vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption and application crashes, and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory Safety Issues:** The primary weakness is the presence of memory safety issues in the browser engine. These include vulnerabilities like heap-based buffer overflows, use-after-free conditions, and other forms of memory corruption that can be triggered by malformed or malicious web content. The vulnerabilities are not directly specified.
*   **Unspecified Vectors:** The specific attack vectors that can be used to trigger these vulnerabilities are not detailed. This lack of specificity in the CVE makes it harder to understand the exact exploitation methods and the specific code involved.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation can result in a denial of service, typically by crashing the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It is presumed that at least some of these memory safety vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, giving an attacker control over the victim's system.
* **Information Leak:** Though not the primary impact, out-of-bounds read vulnerability can lead to sensitive information being leaked from uninitialized memory.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attackers:** Remote attackers can trigger these vulnerabilities by enticing users to open specially crafted web pages.
*   **Malicious Web Content:** Attackers can utilize malformed or malicious web content, particularly SVG graphics and CSS, as vectors for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Web Server or Malicious Site:** Attackers need to host or inject malicious web pages into legitimate websites to lure users into triggering the vulnerabilities.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker must rely on user interaction (i.e., tricking a user into loading a malicious page) to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Scripting (in Browser context):** Scripting capabilities are required in a browser context to exploit the identified weaknesses.

**Additional Details:**
* The identified memory safety issues are present in Firefox before version 36.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.5, and Thunderbird before 31.5.
* The vulnerabilities are more prevalent in browser-like contexts rather than in email clients, due to the default disabling of scripting for mail messages in the latter. However, if a user allows Javascript for mail messages, they are then at risk of exploitation from a specially crafted email message.
* The provided data also reveals that updates to address these issues were released by various vendors including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian.
* The fix also includes a change to prevent the use of local files in autocomplete forms, which is related to CVE-2015-0822 and is often bundled with CVE-2015-0836 fixes, even though the fixes are not always related to each other.

In summary, CVE-2015-0836 involves several memory safety vulnerabilities within Mozilla products, which can lead to a denial of service or potentially allow arbitrary code execution when users interact with malicious web content. It is considered a serious security issue due to its potential for remote exploitation.
