This document provides details about multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS15-018, including CVE-2015-0099.

**CVE-2015-0099:**

*   **Root Cause:** This is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer. It occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability and lure users to visit it. Alternatively, compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content could be used to host the exploit.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a specially crafted website, typically via a link in an email or instant message, or by tricking them into opening a malicious attachment. They have no way to force the user to visit the site, so social engineering is necessary.

**Affected Software (for CVE-2015-0099):**

*   Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT
*   Specific versions of Internet Explorer 11 are not listed in the table for this CVE
