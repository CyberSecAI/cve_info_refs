Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-0933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper path traversal handling in ShareLaTeX. Specifically, the software allows a user to include arbitrary absolute file paths using the `\include{}` command within a LaTeX document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):**  The software fails to restrict the paths that can be included, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as user data and server configurations.
- This could lead to further attacks if the revealed information is sensitive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, authenticated user:** A remote, authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious LaTeX document including the `\include{}` command with an arbitrary absolute path name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have an account and be authenticated in the ShareLaTeX application.
- The attacker can be remote as the vulnerability is exploited via the web interface.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in ShareLaTeX versions prior to 0.1.3.
- While CVE-2015-0934 (command injection) is addressed in version 0.1.3, this path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2015-0933) requires further mitigation.
- Mitigation involves making changes to the LaTeX configuration on the server to restrict file access.
