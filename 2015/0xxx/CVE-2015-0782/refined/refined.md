Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ScheduleQuery` method of the `schedule` class within Novell Zenworks.
*   The root cause is the failure to sanitize user-supplied input before executing a SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Database Context:** The attacker could execute code within the context of the database. This potentially allows for data breaches, modification of data, or denial of service by disrupting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated:** Authentication is not required for exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Zenworks instance.
*   No authentication is required; the attacker can directly target the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported this vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-2576).
*   Novell (now Micro Focus) released a patch to address this vulnerability, affecting multiple versions of ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM).

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-0782 is a critical vulnerability caused by a failure to sanitize user input leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `ScheduleQuery` method of the `schedule` class in Novell Zenworks. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
