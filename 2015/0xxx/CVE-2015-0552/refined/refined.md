Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `gcab` library not properly filtering leading slashes from paths within CAB files during extraction. This lack of sanitization allows for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to use specially crafted CAB files containing paths with leading slashes (e.g., `\tmp\moo`) to write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended extraction directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to write files to locations on the file system that the user running `gcab` has write permissions to, potentially leading to:
    - Overwriting existing files, potentially corrupting system or application configurations or data.
    - Creation of malicious files in sensitive locations, which could be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious CAB File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted CAB file containing malicious file paths, designed to write files outside of the extraction directory.
- **User Interaction:**  The user would likely need to be tricked into extracting the malicious CAB file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious CAB Files:** The attacker needs to be able to generate CAB files that contain the malicious paths.
- **User Access:** The attacker needs to find a way to get a user to use the vulnerable `gcab` tool with the malicious CAB file. This can be through social engineering or other attack vectors to make the victim extract the file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `gcab_folder_extract` function within `libgcab/gcab-folder.c`.
- The fix involves a check to ensure that the extracted file path remains within the intended extraction path.
- The provided information includes a patch for the issue.
- The vulnerability is present in gcab versions prior to the fixes implemented in various distributions.

In summary, CVE-2015-0552 is a directory traversal vulnerability in the gcab library, enabling attackers to write to arbitrary file system locations via a malicious CAB archive.
