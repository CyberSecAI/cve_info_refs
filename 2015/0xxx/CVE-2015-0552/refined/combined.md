Thanks for spotting this, I'm going to submit the following patch which
handles all your traversal cases (albeit in a somewhat ugly manner for
relative traversals):

As a data point, cabextract(1) replaces ".." components with "xx" on
unpack, which is a different kind of ugly. :-)

Hmm. I'm not familiar with GLib, so I wonder in what circumstances
g_file_get_path() can return NULL. What happens in that case?

Apart from the doubts raised above, the patch looks good to me.

Indeed... My patch was accepted upstream so I'll stick with that!

GIO supports non-local filenames (for network files, e.g. via ssh), and when
manipulating those g_file_get_path() returns NULL. The rest of gcab doesn't
deal with this AFAICT so I added the test simply to avoid any risk of
introducing a null pointer dereference!
