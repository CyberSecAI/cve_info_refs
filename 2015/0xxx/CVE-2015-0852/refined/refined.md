Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `PluginPCX.cpp` file within the FreeImage library. Specifically, the `width` and `height` variables are calculated based on values within the PCX image header. If the window values are crafted such that `header.window[2] < header.window[0]` or `header.window[3] < header.window[1]`, an integer underflow occurs during the subtraction, leading to a large positive value for width or height.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking when calculating the `width` and `height` variables. This leads to an integer underflow, which then results in a large positive value due to the way unsigned integers wrap around when going below zero.
*  **Heap Memory Corruption:** The overflow in width can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in the loop that copies image data to the `bits` buffer, specifically `bits[x * 3 + FI_RGBA_RED] = pline[x];`
*  **Denial of Service:** The heap corruption can cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause the application using the FreeImage library to crash by providing a specially crafted PCX image file.
*   **Heap Memory Corruption:** Exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, if the attacker can precisely control the data being written outside the allocated buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted PCX image file. The attacker controls the window values in the image header that cause the integer overflow.
*  **Remote Exploitation**:  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the attacker can send the malicious file to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted PCX image file to a vulnerable application using the FreeImage library.
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability
*   No user interaction beyond opening/processing a crafted image is required

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in FreeImage versions 3.17.0 and earlier.
*   The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the window values in the PCX header do not lead to an underflow.
*   Patches were provided upstream to fix the issue: <http://freeimage.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeimage/FreeImage/Source/FreeImage/PluginPCX.cpp?r1=1.17&r2=1.18&pathrev=MAIN> and <http://freeimage.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeimage/FreeImage/Source/FreeImage/PluginPCX.cpp?r1=1.18&r2=1.19&pathrev=MAIN>
*   Debian provided updates for oldstable (wheezy), stable (jessie), and testing/unstable, along with a DSA (DSA-3392-1).
*   Gentoo also released a GLSA (201701-68) to address this vulnerability.
