Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `doPost` method of the `Rtrlet` class within Novell Zenworks.
*   The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize the path of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, enabling them to place files in arbitrary locations on the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious files to arbitrary locations, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, giving the attacker significant control over the compromised server.
*   **Compromised Server:** An attacker can potentially take full control of the affected system, enabling them to perform various malicious activities such as data theft, denial-of-service, or further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious HTTP POST requests containing specially crafted file paths to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target Zenworks server.
*   **No Authentication (Default):** By default, authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easier for attackers to exploit. However, this might depend on the specific configuration of the Zenworks installation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Novell on 2015-01-15, and a coordinated public release of the advisory happened on 2015-04-22
*   Novell has released a patch to correct the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a CVSS score of 6.8 with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, which is considered medium severity.
