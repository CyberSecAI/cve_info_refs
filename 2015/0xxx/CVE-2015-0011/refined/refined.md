Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the WebDAV kernel-mode driver (mrxdav.sys).
- The driver fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation and enforcement of impersonation levels.
- This allows bypassing of impersonation-level security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain elevated privileges on the affected system.
- An attacker could intercept WebDAV requests for files from any server, including corporate SharePoint sites.
- Redirect file requests to return attacker-controlled files, which could be malicious.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to log on to the affected system locally.
- The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application.
- User interaction is required for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid logon credentials on the target system.
- Ability to log on locally to the target system.
- Ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver validates impersonation levels.
- Microsoft did not receive information indicating public exploitation of the vulnerability when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- The document provides workarounds which involve disabling the WebDAV driver via registry edits.
