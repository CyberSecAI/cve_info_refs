Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue within the JavaScript engine's `ChangeObjectFixedSlotCount` function. This function could incorrectly alter the extensibility of JavaScript objects, specifically those marked as non-extensible via `Object.preventExtensions()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass intended restrictions on object extensibility. This is particularly critical for sandboxing environments like Google's Caja and Secure EcmaScript (SES), which rely on object freezing to enforce security boundaries.
- **Extensibility Manipulation:** The vulnerability enables a non-extensible object to become extensible again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Restrictions Bypass:**  An attacker could potentially bypass the security mechanisms provided by the Caja Compiler or similar sandboxing libraries.
- **Code Execution:**  Although not directly stated, the ability to make a non-extensible object extensible could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the affected sandbox, particularly if combined with other vulnerabilities. It was considered a "sec-moderate" issue by Mozilla, which implies a non-trivial security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious JavaScript code within a website that uses the Caja Compiler or a similar sandbox. The vulnerability is not directly exploitable to affect the browser itself.
- **Content Script:** A malicious content script could potentially trigger the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Javascript:** The attacker needs to inject or control JavaScript that executes within a sandboxed environment utilizing a vulnerable version of JavaScript engine.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Understanding of how `ChangeObjectFixedSlotCount` interacts with objects marked as non-extensible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was initially discovered in a jstest failure and was difficult to reproduce reliably.
- The vulnerability was considered a "sec-high for Caja" in Mozilla's Bugzilla.
- The vulnerability only affects code running in a sandbox relying on the Caja Compiler
- Workarounds using `seal()` or `freeze()` on objects with at least one property, or calling constructor more than 20 times, were discovered, allowing the affected sandboxing systems to mitigate the issue before a patch was widely available.
