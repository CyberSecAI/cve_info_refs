Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0794:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `dracut` utility used a hardcoded filename `/tmp/dracut_block_uuid.map`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Symlink Attack:** The use of a hardcoded filename in `/tmp` allowed a local attacker to create a symbolic link (symlink) with the same name, pointing to an arbitrary file.
*   **File Overwrite/Destruction:** When `dracut` runs (typically during initrd/initramfs creation), it would write to the hardcoded path, leading to overwriting or destruction of the attacker-specified file.
*   **Insecure Temporary File Usage:**  The broader issue revealed by the bug report is the use of various hardcoded `/tmp` files within `dracut` scripts, potentially leading to other symlink attacks and even code execution vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Destruction:** A local non-root attacker could overwrite or destroy any file on the system to which they have write access via symlink redirection, potentially leading to a denial of service or other malicious impacts.
* **Potential Code Execution:** The report also mentions that some hardcoded `/tmp` usages could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution as root, although the specific case for `/tmp/dracut_block_uuid.map` is file overwrite/destruction.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create the malicious symlink before `dracut` runs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be a local non-root user.
*   The attacker needs write access to the `/tmp` directory.
*   The attacker needs to know when `dracut` will execute in order to have the symlink in place before that execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `dracut` versions before `037-17.30.1` in openSUSE 13.2.
*   The fix involved replacing the hardcoded filename with a dynamically generated temporary file name using `mktemp`.
*   Several other hardcoded `/tmp` filenames were also found and fixed.
*   The issue was rated as having "moderate" severity.
*  The vulnerability exists within the `/usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/90crypt/module-setup.sh` script.
* The affected code was introduced by a SUSE-specific patch.
