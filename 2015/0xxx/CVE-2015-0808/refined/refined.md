  "CVE-2015-0808": {
    "description": "The webrtc::VPMContentAnalysis::Release function in the WebRTC implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0 uses incompatible approaches to the deallocation of memory for simple-type arrays, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "Incompatible memory deallocation approaches for simple-type arrays within the `webrtc::VPMContentAnalysis::Release` function in WebRTC.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of `delete` instead of `delete[]` for memory allocated with `new uint8_t[width_ * height_]`",
        "Mismatched free / delete / delete[]"
      ],
      "impact": "Potential denial of service due to memory corruption.  According to some sources, the vulnerability is also theoretically dangerous and could lead to arbitrary code execution, although it was determined to be safe in this particular instance. The official description mentions only denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Unspecified vectors related to WebRTC functionality, likely involving processing of video frames or related data.",
