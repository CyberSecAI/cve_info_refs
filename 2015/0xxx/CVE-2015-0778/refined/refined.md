Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0778:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of parameters within the `_service` files used by the `osc` (Open Build Service command-line client) tool. Specifically, the `name` and `param` attributes were not sanitized, which allowed for the injection of shell metacharacters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Shell command injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through crafted `_service` files. The unsanitized input was directly used in shell execution.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The root cause is the absence of proper input validation and sanitization of the `name` and `param` attributes in the `_service` files, both on the client and server side.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `osc` process. This means that an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted `_service` file:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious `_service` file with injected shell metacharacters in the `name` or `param` attributes.
- **`osc service run` command:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user executes the `osc service run` command on a project containing the malicious `_service` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create/modify `_service` files:** An attacker would need to create or modify a `_service` file within an OBS project.
- **User interaction:** The attack requires a user to download the malicious `_service` file (or the entire project) and execute `osc service run` command.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present on both the client and server side of Open Build Service.
- The vulnerability affects users who checkout sources containing crafted `_service` files from untrusted sources.
- Patches were released for osc versions 0.151.0 and higher to resolve this.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2015-0778.
