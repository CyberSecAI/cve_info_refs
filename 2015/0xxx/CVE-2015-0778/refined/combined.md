| [Description](#c0)  Stein Magnus Jodal    2002-02-05 17:12:50 UTC  ``` From the SILC's official site:  "SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides secure conferencing services on the Internet over insecure channel. SILC  superficially resembles IRC, although they are very different internally. They both provide conferencing services and have almost the same set of  commands. Other than that, they are nothing alike. The SILC is secure and  the network model is entirely different compared to IRC."  Here is my ebuild, my first ever, of the client. It is based on Irssi so I  used Irssi's ebuild script as a basis. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Stein Magnus Jodal    2002-02-05 17:14:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 130](attachment.cgi?id=130 "silc-client-0.7.6.2.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=130&action=edit "silc-client-0.7.6.2.ebuild")] silc-client-0.7.6.2.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  chouser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-06 16:28:46 UTC  ``` Here are some initial comments...  You can submit a new version if you'd like, otherwise I will fix these when I get a chance.  - please use a variable for at least the version of the package in SRC_URI - there is a 'ncurses' USE var; avoid making the user to edit the ebuild. - refer to ncurses USE var in DEPENDS as well - should be "use ipv6" not "user ipv6" - are all the configure settings needed? could be -- I haven't tested them yet - are all the make install settings needed?  again, they might be - make install's docdir is missing the $(D)  Some of these mistakes would have been easier for you to catch if you had looked at (or started with) /usr/portage/skel.ebuild instead of an existing and possibly older ebuild.  Others would be caught by including "sandbox" in your MAINTAINER setting in /etc/make.conf (assuming you have an up to date version of portage), and then tested the ebuild.  Thanks for the ebuild -- we appreciate it!  --Chouser ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Stein Magnus Jodal    2002-02-06 17:19:07 UTC  ``` Everything mentioned fixed. That ncurses was a USE variable is neither mentioned in the guide nor in  /etc/make.conf. user -> use should be fixed in the Irssi ebuild file too. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Stein Magnus Jodal    2002-02-06 17:24:41 UTC  ``` Bugzilla won't let me attach a file, so I posted it at <http://www.s-mag.net/temp/silc-client-0.7.6.2.ebuild> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  chouser (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-07 22:14:13 UTC  ``` Thanks for making the changes.  I'm sorry; I was mistaken about the ncurses use variable -- thanks for checking the docs and correcting me.  I've posted a bug for the Irssi ebuild ([bug 567](show_bug.cgi?id=567 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"user ipv6\" typo in net-irc/irssi/irssi-0.7.98.4.ebuild"))  This is a messy app to package, I'm afraid...  Once I started testing the install, I found that it was defaulting to all sorts of bad places to put various files.  I think I've fixed them all.  I also added the 'experimental' socks5 USE var.  I don't really know how to use this app, so if you could give this ebuild a good testing, I'd appreciate it.  Also, I put this in the net-im category. Does that seem right?  Thanks for the ebuild! ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Stein Magnus Jodal    2002-02-08 07:11:44 UTC  ``` It is not compatible with IRC, but it is used in the same way and the client  is based on an IRC client. net-irc could be confusing, net-im should be okay  since IRC is a form of instant messaging. ``` |  |
