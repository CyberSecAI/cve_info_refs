{
  "cveId": "CVE-2015-0097",
  "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Office software improperly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files, which can corrupt system memory, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of objects in memory",
    "Parsing of specially crafted files"
  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. With administrative privileges, the attacker gains complete control of the affected system, enabling actions such as installing programs, data manipulation, and creating new accounts.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "Email: Attacker sends a specially crafted file to the user and convinces the user to open it.",
    "Web-based: Attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted file and convinces users to visit it and open the file."
  ],
  "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open the specially crafted file using email or a malicious website.",
  "additonalDetails": "The exploit-db entry provides additional information stating that the vulnerability is triggered when Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint 2007 references document types like Works document (.wps) as HTML, which then processes HTML and script code within the context of the local machine zone of Internet Explorer. This leads to arbitrary code execution by persuading users into opening specially crafted .WPS, \".doc \", or \".RTF \" (with a space at the end)."
