Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7u75-2.5.4-1~deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7u75-2.5.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.7.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 7 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591, CVE-2014-6593,
CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403, CVE-2015-0406,
CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412, CVE-2015-0413)

protocol to address the CVE-2014-3566 issue (also known as POODLE). Refer
to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section for
instructions on how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed.

All users of java-1.7.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 7 Update 75 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

# IcedTea: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IcedTea allowing remote
attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability through
various vectors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.4**revision >= **6.1.13.9**< **6** |

| Package | **dev-java/icedtea-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.2.6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.2.6.4**revision >= **6.1.13.9**< **6** |

### Background

IcedTea’s aim is to provide OpenJDK in a form suitable for easy
configuration, compilation and distribution with the primary goal of
allowing inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions.

### Description

Various OpenJDK attack vectors in IcedTea, such as 2D, Corba, Hotspot,
Libraries, and JAXP, exist which allows remote attackers to affect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of vulnerable systems. This
includes the possibility of remote execution of arbitrary code,
information disclosure, or Denial of Service. Many of the
vulnerabilities can only be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start
applications and java applets. Please reference the CVEs listed for
specific details.

### Impact

Remote attackers may remotely execute arbitrary code, compromise
information, or cause Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known work around at this time.

### Resolution

IcedTea 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-7.2.6.4"

```

IcedTea bin 7.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-7.2.6.4"

```

IcedTea 6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-6.1.13.9"

```

IcedTea bin 6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/icedtea-bin-6.1.13.9"

```

fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any Java

applications or applets to make all the necessary changes.

This update contains a known regression in the Zero alternative Java

Virtual Machine on PowerPC and a future update will correct this issue. See

<https://launchpad.net/bugs/1415282> for details. We apologize for the

inconvenience.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b34-1.13.6-1~deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0068)

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.7.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 7 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 7 Java Software Development Kit.

A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified
bytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet
could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2014-6601)

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS,
and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet
could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0412,
CVE-2015-0408)

A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled phantom
references. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to
corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute arbitrary
code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0395)

A flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder
in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length values. A
specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java application to
enter an infinite loop when decoded. (CVE-2015-0410)

A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3.0 protocol handled padding bytes when
decrypting messages that were encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw could possibly allow a man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacker to decrypt portions of the cipher text using a padding
oracle attack. (CVE-2014-3566)

Note: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to address this issue.
The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property can be used to re-enable
SSL 3.0 support if needed. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat
Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section.

It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component in
OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was received
during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker could possibly
use this flaw to force a connection to be established without encryption
being enabled. (CVE-2014-6593)

An information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in OpenJDK. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain
Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0407)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket
implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java
application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-6587)

Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an
untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java
Virtual Machine memory. (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591)

Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the
Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log
files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK
overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack. (CVE-2015-0383)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

All users of java-1.7.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Updated java-1.8.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 8 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6549, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591,
CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403,

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0085)

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix multiple security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The java-1.6.0-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime
Environment and the OpenJDK 6 Java Software Development Kit.

A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot component in OpenJDK verified
bytecode from the class files. An untrusted Java application or applet
could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
(CVE-2014-6601)

Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JAX-WS,
and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet
could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0412,
CVE-2015-0408)

A flaw was found in the way the Hotspot garbage collector handled phantom
references. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to
corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and, possibly, execute arbitrary
code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0395)

A flaw was found in the way the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) decoder
in the Security component in OpenJDK handled negative length values. A
specially crafted, DER-encoded input could cause a Java application to
enter an infinite loop when decoded. (CVE-2015-0410)

A flaw was found in the way the SSL 3.0 protocol handled padding bytes when
decrypting messages that were encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw could possibly allow a man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacker to decrypt portions of the cipher text using a padding
oracle attack. (CVE-2014-3566)

Note: This update disables SSL 3.0 by default to address this issue.
The jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms security property can be used to re-enable
SSL 3.0 support if needed. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat
Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section.

It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component in
OpenJDK failed to properly check whether the ChangeCipherSpec was received
during the SSL/TLS connection handshake. An MITM attacker could possibly
use this flaw to force a connection to be established without encryption
being enabled. (CVE-2014-6593)

An information leak flaw was found in the Swing component in OpenJDK. An
untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass certain
Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2015-0407)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MulticastSocket
implementation in the Libraries component of OpenJDK. An untrusted Java
application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java
sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-6587)

Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the font parsing code in the 2D
component in OpenJDK. A specially crafted font file could allow an
untrusted Java application or applet to disclose portions of the Java
Virtual Machine memory. (CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591)

Multiple insecure temporary file use issues were found in the way the
Hotspot component in OpenJDK created performance statistics and error log
files. A local attacker could possibly make a victim using OpenJDK
overwrite arbitrary files using a symlink attack. (CVE-2015-0383)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

# RHSA-2015:0086 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: java-1.6.0-sun security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-sun packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 6 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591, CVE-2014-6593,
CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403, CVE-2015-0406,
CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

Note: With this update, the Oracle Java SE now disables the SSL 3.0
protocol to address the CVE-2014-3566 issue (also known as POODLE). Refer
to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section for
instructions on how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed.

All users of java-1.6.0-sun are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 6 Update 91 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.
