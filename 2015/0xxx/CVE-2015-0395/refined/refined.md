Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-0395 from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how the Hotspot garbage collector handles phantom references in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper handling of phantom references in Hotspot garbage collector
*  Potential for memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote code execution:** An attacker could corrupt the JVM's memory, leading to the possibility of executing arbitrary code.
*   **Bypass of sandbox restrictions:** The vulnerability can be used to circumvent Java sandbox restrictions that are meant to isolate untrusted code.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** As stated in some of the source material.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through untrusted Java applications or applets. These could be delivered via web browsers or other Java-enabled clients.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to run a malicious Java application/applet on the target system. This could be achieved via:
    *   A malicious website that uses Java applets
    *   An untrusted application or applet run by the user

**Technical Details from specific sources:**

*   **HP Security Bulletin:**
    *   CVSS score of 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
    *   Affected: HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23, and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE v6.0.24 and earlier; HP-UX B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE v7.0.11 and earlier
    *   Resolution: upgrade to Java v6.0.25 or subsequent, and Java v7.0.12 or subsequent.
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:**
    *   States a flaw in how the Hotspot garbage collector handles phantom references could allow an untrusted applet to corrupt JVM memory and execute code.
    *   Fixed in IcedTea6 1.13.6 and IcedTea7 2.5.4.
*  **Red Hat Security Advisory:**
    *   States an untrusted applet could use the phantom reference flaw to corrupt the Java Virtual Machine memory and possibly execute arbitrary code, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions
    *   Also covers CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0412, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6591, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2015-0403, CVE-2015-0406, and CVE-2015-0413
