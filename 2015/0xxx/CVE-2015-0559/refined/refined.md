Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) dissector in Wireshark has a flaw that can lead to a crash. This flaw is triggered by malformed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A vulnerability exists in the WCCP dissector that allows an attacker to cause a crash. This is likely due to a parsing error or a buffer overflow when handling malformed or unexpected data within WCCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash. This could lead to a denial-of-service condition, particularly in environments that rely on Wireshark for network analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves injecting a malformed WCCP packet onto the network.
- Another attack vector could involve convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file containing malicious WCCP data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject malformed packets onto a network that Wireshark is monitoring, or be able to provide a malicious pcap file to a victim.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system, just the ability to influence the traffic seen by Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.2 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.11.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.12, as well as later versions.
- The issue was tracked in Wireshark's bug tracker as issues 10720 and 10806.
- This vulnerability is associated with the Wireshark security advisory wnpa-sec-2015-01.
- Multiple operating systems were affected, including openSUSE 13.1 and 13.2, where it was patched by the openSUSE-SU-2015:0113-1 update.
