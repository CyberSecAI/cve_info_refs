Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0054:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
-  The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions, which could allow script to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Elevation of Privilege vulnerability.
- Improper permission validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run scripts with elevated privileges within the context of Internet Explorer.
- This vulnerability could be chained with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) to run arbitrary code with the elevated privileges. This could allow an attacker to bypass low integrity level restrictions and gain medium integrity level permissions (permissions of the current user).

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker hosts a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
-  The attacker compromises existing websites or websites that host user-provided content and injects malicious content.
-  The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious site or open a malicious file, for example by clicking a link sent through email or instant messenger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website a user may visit.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit this malicious site while using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
