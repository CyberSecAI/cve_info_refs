The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Adobe Font Driver, including CVE-2015-0087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Adobe Font Driver improperly handling objects in memory during font processing. Specifically, the driver has issues when reading or displaying certain fonts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially disclose memory contents. This is due to the Adobe Font Driver's improper handling of memory when parsing specific fonts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain sensitive information about the system's memory. This information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass security features like KASLR and further compromise the system. This vulnerability alone does not allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted website or open a specially crafted file.
- In web-based attacks, the attacker can host the malicious website or compromise a site that accepts user content or ads.
- The vulnerability can also be exploited via email, through malicious links or attachments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted font file or web content to the victim. This can be done via a website or email. The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious content.
