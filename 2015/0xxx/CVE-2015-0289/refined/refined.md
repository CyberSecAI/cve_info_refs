  "CVE-2015-0289": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not affected by this flaw.",
