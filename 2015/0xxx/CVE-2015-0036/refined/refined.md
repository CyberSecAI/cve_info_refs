- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. With administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker hosts a specially crafted website, or takes advantage of compromised/user-content accepting websites by adding malicious content. The attacker then needs to convince a user to view the website, typically through a link in an email/message or by opening an email attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to view it in an affected version of Internet Explorer.
