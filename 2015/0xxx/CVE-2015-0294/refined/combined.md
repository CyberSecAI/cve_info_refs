Debian Security Advisory DSA-3191-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : gnutls26
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0282 CVE-2015-0294

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GnuTLS, a library
implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-0282

    GnuTLS does not verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match
    the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential
    downgrade to a disallowed algorithm without detecting it.

CVE-2015-0294

    It was reported that GnuTLS does not check whether the two signature
    algorithms match on certificate import.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1196323#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-25 17:12:56 UTC  ``` It was reported that all versions of GnuTLS did not check whether the two signature algorithms match on certificate import.  There are no known attacks that could lead to a forged certificate because of that, but the possibility of it is not eliminated either (it depends on whether there can be cross-signature attacks).  Upstream commit that fix this:  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6e76e9b9fa845b76b0b9a45f05f4b54a052578ff>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1196323#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2015-03-04 09:02:45 UTC  ``` Upstream test case:  <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/ca35341243dc2ba13cd703d25becea5da293bc35>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1196323#c7)  Huzaifa S.
