Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a missing check in GnuTLS during certificate import. Specifically, GnuTLS fails to verify if the signature algorithms used in different parts of an X.509 certificate are consistent with each other.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent Signature Algorithms:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation that ensures all sections of an X.509 certificate use the same signature algorithm.
- **Potential for Bypass:** The bug report mentions that this flaw, combined with a different one, could potentially lead to a bypass of the certificate signature check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Certificate Forgery:** Although no known attacks are confirmed, there's a possibility of forging a certificate if a cross-signature attack is feasible by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Downgrade Attack:**  Combined with CVE-2015-0282, this could potentially downgrade to a disallowed algorithm.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Certificate Import:** An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious certificate with inconsistent signature algorithms, which is then imported by a vulnerable GnuTLS implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Certificate:** An attacker needs the capability to create or modify an X.509 certificate in a way that different parts of it contain inconsistent signature algorithms.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** There is no clear attack vector besides MITM to present the crafted certificate in this document.

**Additional Details:**

- **Upstream Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in GnuTLS version 3.3.13.
- **Red Hat Severity:** Red Hat has rated the security impact of this issue as "Low."
- **Mitigation:** The issue is fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2015:1457
- **Affected Versions:** The bug report states that all versions of GnuTLS were affected prior to the fix.
- **Cross-Signature Attacks:** The bug report suggests the impact of this vulnerability relies on the possibility of "cross-signature attacks", which is not further elaborated.
