Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0245:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `dbus-daemon` not properly verifying the source of `ActivationFailure` messages on systems using systemd-style service activation. Specifically, it doesn't check if the signal actually originated from systemd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization, where the `dbus-daemon` accepts `ActivationFailure` signals from any local process, instead of only systemd.
- **Lack of Source Verification:** The `dbus-daemon` fails to authenticate that the `ActivationFailure` message is coming from the expected source (systemd).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious local user can send forged `ActivationFailure` signals to the `dbus-daemon`, causing it to incorrectly report that a system service failed to activate. This leads to an error being returned to the client that requested the service activation, preventing the service from being used as intended.
- **Service Disruption:** Although the system service itself is not prevented from starting, the DoS prevents the initial connection with the service via D-Bus until a timeout has been reached.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is a local user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system to send D-Bus signals to the `dbus-daemon`.
- **Ability to send D-Bus messages:** The attacker must be able to send D-Bus signals to the `dbus-daemon` to forge `ActivationFailure` messages.

**Technical Details**
-The vulnerability exists in dbus versions >= 1.4.0.
-The vulnerability is related to the systemd activation mechanism, where dbus-daemon uses a D-Bus signal to ask systemd to start a service.
-The vulnerability can be mitigated by altering system.conf to restrict the sending of ActivationFailure messages to uid 0, but a more comprehensive solution requires code changes.
-The recommended fix is to upgrade to dbus versions >= 1.9.10, 1.8.x >= 1.8.16, or 1.6.x >= 1.6.30, or apply relevant patches.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is a local DoS, not a remote one.
- The service is not actually prevented from starting but it may be disrupted initially.
- Patches are available to address the issue by either restricting the ability to send forged messages via system.conf or discarding the messages in the dbus-daemon itself.
- The advisory mentions that a patch is also available that factors out a common function, `bus_driver_get_owner_of_name` to avoid code duplication.

In summary, CVE-2015-0245 describes a local DoS vulnerability in the D-Bus daemon, specifically affecting systemd-activated services. It arises from the daemon's failure to properly verify the source of activation failure messages, allowing local users to disrupt service access by sending forged messages.
