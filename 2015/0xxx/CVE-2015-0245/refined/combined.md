Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0245
Debian Bug     : 777545

Simon McVittie discovered a local denial of service flaw in dbus, an
asynchronous inter-process communication system. On systems with
systemd-style service activation, dbus-daemon does not prevent forged
ActivationFailure messages from non-root processes. A malicious local
user could use this flaw to trick dbus-daemon into thinking that systemd
failed to activate a system service, resulting in an error reply back to
the requester.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

Subject: CVE-2015-0245: denial of service in dbus >= 1.4 systemd activation

Bug tracked as: CVE-2015-0245
Bug tracked as: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88811>
Versions affected: dbus >= 1.4.0
Versions fixed: >= 1.9.10, 1.8.x >= 1.8.16, 1.6.x >= 1.6.30
Type of vulnerability: CWE-285 Improper Authorization
Exploitable by: local users
Impact: denial of service
Reporter: Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

dbus-daemon can "activate" (auto-start) D-Bus services on-demand when it
receives a message addressed to them. In versions >= 1.4.0 of dbus, it
can do this by using a D-Bus signal to ask systemd to carry out the
actual service start.

systemd sends back an ActivationFailure D-Bus signal if the activation
fails. However, when it receives these signals, dbus-daemon does not
verify that the signal actually came from systemd. A malicious local
user could send repeated ActivationFailure signals in the hope that it
would "win the race" with the genuine signal, causing D-Bus to send back
an error to the client that requested activation.

Mitigation: the system service is not actually prevented from starting
or claiming its well-known bus name, and after it has done so,
subsequent clients can communicate with it as usual.

The recommended fix for stable distributions is to alter system.conf
similar to the attached patch (commit link below), or upgrade to version
1.8.16 or 1.6.30. This restricts the attack to uid 0, making it a
non-issue in practice.

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=6dbd09fedc396c53b25ea73c6c8a278beca349c7>

The full solution involves additional code changes and has only been
made in the 1.9 development branch so far, but is easy to backport to
1.8 if required (e.g. for environments where uid 0 is not all-powerful
due to use of LSMs). It requires two additional commits:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=aaea59916398d1c590490edb0471a01bcf20e6d7>
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=03c5e161752fe1ff4925955800ca9c78d09a6e0c>

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - April 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for dbus-1, dbus-1-x11
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0300-1
Rating: moderate
References: #916343
Cross-References: CVE-2015-0245
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
dbus-1, dbus-1-x11 were updated to version 1.8.16 to fix one security
issue.
This update fixes the following security issue:
- CVE-2015-0245: Do not allow non-uid-0 processes to send forged
ActivationFailure messages. On Linux systems with systemd activation,
this would allow a local denial of service (bnc#916343).
These additional security hardenings are included:
- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment from uids
other than the uid of the dbus-daemon. If a system service installs
unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls (such as
CVE-2014-8148) then this prevents memory consumption and possible
privilege escalation via UpdateActivationEnvironment.
- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment or the Stats interface
on object paths other than /org/freedesktop/DBus. Some system services
install unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls
to any destination, method and interface with a specified object path.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-150=1
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-150=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.  dbus-daemon can "activate" (auto-start) D-Bus services on-demand when it receives a message addressed to them. In versions >= 1.4.0 of dbus, it can do this by using a D-Bus signal to ask systemd to carry out the actual service start.  systemd sends back an ActivationFailure D-Bus signal if the activation fails. However, when it receives these signals, dbus-daemon does not verify that the signal actually came from systemd. A malicious local user could send repeated ActivationFailure signals in the hope that it would "win the race" with the genuine signal, causing D-Bus to send back an error to the client that requested activation.  Mitigation: the system service is not actually prevented from starting or claiming its well-known bus name, and after it has done so, subsequent clients can communicate with it as usual. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=916343#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-06 16:13:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 622249](attachment.cgi?id=622249&action=diff "Proposed code changes") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=622249&action=edit "Proposed code changes") Proposed code changes ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=916343#c7)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-02-09 20:00:23 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (916343) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284951> 13.2 / dbus-1-x11+dbus-1 <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284952> 13.1 / dbus-1-x11+dbus-1 <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/284953> Factory / dbus-1 ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=916343#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-02-17 12:04:54 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0300-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
