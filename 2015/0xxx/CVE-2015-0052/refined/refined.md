Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-0052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE)
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the current user.
- If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website. This could be done by:
   - Tricking the user into clicking a link in an instant message or email.
   - Compromising a website and embedding the malicious content.
   - Injecting malicious content into websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious code.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Affected Software:**
- Internet Explorer 10 and 11 on both client and server versions of Windows are affected

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The document notes that while it's a memory corruption issue, the exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- There are no identified mitigating factors or workarounds beyond applying the security update.
