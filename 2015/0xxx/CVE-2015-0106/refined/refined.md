Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper validation of user-supplied input within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) Process Portal. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. This means that the malicious script is embedded within a specially crafted URL and is executed in the victim's browser when they click on the link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's web browser within the security context of the hosting web site.
*   **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal a user's cookie-based authentication credentials. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that contains the script payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL. This could be done via email, social media, or any other channel where the attacker can influence the victim to access the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable system. They only need to be able to send the malicious URL to a victim.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires some form of user interaction to activate the malicious script by clicking the malicious link.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** While the description says an authenticated user could inject the script into the response, the impact is on other users that might inadvertently navigate to the injected URL, implying the injection can be done by anyone, but the impact affects users who access the malicious URL while authenticated to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Business Process Manager (Standard, Express, Advanced) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition.
*   The fix involves removing the injected script when the response is received from the Process Portal.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by APAR JR50795.
