## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) is vulnerable to reflected
  cross-site scripting because user input is insufficient
  validated.  An authenticated user can inject a malicious script
  into a response returned from a servlet. Other users might
  inadvertently navigate to a script injected URL and run this
  script without their knowledge.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  No additional information is available.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix will be available for the latest fix pack of all supported
   and affected releases that removes the injected script when you
   receive the response from Process Portal.

  To see if a fix is available for your release, go to Fix Central
  (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral) and search for JR50795:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
  the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
  2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR50795, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.
