Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0198:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) may not properly authenticate network requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper authentication of network requests

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute programs remotely with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable GPFS instance.
- No authentication is required for the initial attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects GPFS versions V4.1, V3.5, and V3.4, and also DB2 pureScale Feature on AIX and Linux that uses GPFS.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by setting the `cipherList` configuration variable to `AUTHONLY` or a cipher, or ensuring only trusted nodes/processes/users can initiate connections to GPFS nodes.
- The fix involves applying updated versions of GPFS or DB2 and setting `cipherList` to `AUTHONLY`.
