```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the use of the MD5 hash algorithm for storing user passwords in the database. MD5 is known to be vulnerable to brute force attacks and is not considered secure for password hashing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916). The system utilizes MD5 for password hashing, which is susceptible to brute-force attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. An attacker could gain access to user credentials by cracking the MD5 hashes, potentially gaining full control of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with network access and user authentication can attempt to brute-force the MD5 hashes. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have valid login credentials or be able to obtain them."
