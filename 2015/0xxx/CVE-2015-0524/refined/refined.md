    {
      "source": "www.securify.nl_f9d02562_20250125_214258.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insecurely creating SQL statements using string concatenation in the `ProvisioningDaoImpl.java` file, specifically in the `update` method. This method directly concatenates user-controlled input (such as `status.getSerialNumber()` and `status.getSiteID()`) into the SQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve arbitrary data from the application, interfere with its logic, or execute commands on the database server itself.",
       "attack_vectors": "The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `provisioningStatus` and `ProvisioningResponse` which contain user-controlled input such as `serialnumber`, `siteid`, and `username`.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the ESRS portal that can influence the vulnerable parameters."
