Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-0561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the LPP (Location Positioning Protocol) dissector in Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The LPP dissector has a flaw that can lead to a crash. The specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed beyond "the LPP dissector could crash". The vulnerability is triggered by malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash. This can be achieved by:
    - Injecting a malformed LPP packet onto the network.
    - Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file (pcap file).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network injection: An attacker sends a specially crafted LPP packet to a system running Wireshark.
- Malicious trace file: An attacker sends a malformed pcap file to a Wireshark user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject packets onto the network or provide a malformed trace file to a user running Wireshark. The attacker does not require prior authentication or direct access to the target system.
- Basic knowledge of network protocols and packet manipulation is required to craft the malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as `wnpa-sec-2015-02`.
- Affected Wireshark versions: 1.12.0 to 1.12.2, and 1.10.0 to 1.10.11.
- The issue is resolved in Wireshark versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.12 and later.
- The bug was initially discovered via fuzzing by a Buildbot builder.
