Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GetClientReg` method of the Moxa VPort ActiveX SDK PLUS's `VPORTSDK.VPortSDKCtrl.1` ActiveX control. This occurs when an overly long string is passed to the `Name` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):** The software does not properly validate the size of the input string, leading to a buffer overflow when writing the data to a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the same privileges as the user running the vulnerable application (typically the web browser).
*   This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing attackers to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file (e.g., a specially crafted HTML file) containing the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious webpage or file to the victim. This could be done through various means such as email, malicious links on websites, or other methods of social engineering.
*   The attacker needs a low skill level to create an exploit for this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected products are the Moxa VPort ActiveX SDK products, specifically all versions prior to Version 2.8. A list of affected products is provided.
*   Moxa has released an update (version 2.8 or later) to fix this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID '16895'.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Moxa by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) after being discovered by independent researcher Ariele Caltabiano.
* The CVSS v2 base score is 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).

This analysis provides a detailed view of the vulnerability, including its technical cause, the impact of exploitation, the attack vector, and the required attacker capabilities, which aligns with the information provided by the sources.
