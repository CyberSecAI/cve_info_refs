# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,

      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# RichFaces exploitation toolkit

---

*From*: Red Timmy Security <publications () redtimmy com>

*Date*: Fri, 13 Mar 2020 21:29:47 +0100

---

```

Hi,

```
The RichFaces library has been vulnerable to many Java deserialization
and EL injection vulnerabilities. This infamous library is included with
many JSF web applications for providing advanced UI elements beyond the
(very limited) set that is built-in with the framework. Therefore, many
websites using JSF are vulnerable to exploitation.
```

```
Until now, the vulnerabilities had to be exploited manually. Richsploit
is a toolkit that can exploit multiple versions of RichFaces:
```

RichFaces 3
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.3   CVE-2013-2165
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-12533
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-14667
RichFaces 4
4.0.0 ≤ 4.3.2   CVE-2013-2165
4.0.0 ≤ 4.5.4   CVE-2015-0279
4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17  CVE-2018-12532

```
For more information, please read our blog post at:
<https://www.redtimmy.com/java-hacking/richsploit-one-tool-to-exploit-all-versions-of-richfaces-ever-released/>
```

```
The tool can be downloaded from GitHub:
<https://github.com/redtimmy/Richsploit>
```

Regards,
Red Timmy Security

# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

IT Security Center

Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```
