## Advisories before 2018

| Tag | Other identifiers | Description | Information || GNUTLS-SA-2017-4 |  | Crash | It was found using the [TLS fuzzer](https://github.com/tomato42/tlsfuzzer) tools that decoding a status response TLS extension with valid contents could lead to a crash due to a null pointer dereference. The issue affects GnuTLS server applications. The issue was fixed in 3.5.13. **Recommendation:** To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.5.13 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-3 | [CVE-2017-7869](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7869) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted OpenPGP certificates could lead to (**A**) an integer overflow, resulting to an invalid memory write, (**B**) a null pointer dereference resulting to a server crash, and (**C**) a large allocation, resulting to a server out-of-memory condition. These affect only applications which utilize the OpenPGP certificate functionality of GnuTLS. The issues were fixed in 3.5.10. **Recommendation:** The support of OpenPGP certificates in GnuTLS [is considered obsolete](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/102). As such, it is not recommended to use OpenPGP certificates with GnuTLS. To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.5.10 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-2 | [CVE-2017-5335](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5335) [CVE-2017-5336](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5336) [CVE-2017-5337](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5337) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted OpenPGP certificate could lead to heap and stack overflows. This affects only applications which utilize the OpenPGP certificate functionality of GnuTLS. This issue was fixed in GnuTLS 3.3.26 and 3.5.8. **Recommendation:** The support of OpenPGP certificates in GnuTLS [is considered obsolete](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/issues/102). As such, it is not recommended to use OpenPGP certificates with GnuTLS. To address the issues found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.26, 3.5.8 or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2017-1 | [CVE-2017-5334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5334) | Memory corruption | It was found using the [OSS-FUZZ](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) fuzzer infrastructure that decoding a specially crafted X.509 certificate with Proxy Certificate Information extension present could lead to a double free.

| GNUTLS-SA-2016-2 |  | Certificate verification issue | We discoverd a vulnerability that affects certificate verification when GnuTLS is used in combination with the p11-kit trust module. That issue affects gnutls 3.3.23, 3.4.12 and later versions.  **Who is affected by this vulnerability?**  * GnuTLS installations which are configured to utilize the p11-kit trust store (i.e., when compiled with --with-default-trust-store-pkcs11).  **How to mitigate the vulnerability?**  * Disable the trust store verification or upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.24, 3.4.14 and later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2016-1 | [CVE-2016-4456](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4456) | File overwrite by setuid programs | Setuid programs using GnuTLS 3.4.12 could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite and corrupt arbitrary files in the filesystem. This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12 with the GNUTLS\_KEYLOGFILE environment variable handling via getenv() and fixed in GnuTLS 3.4.13 by switching to secure\_getenv() where available. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-4 | [CVE-2015-3308](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3308) | Double free in CRL distribution points decoding of a certificate | Robert ÅwiÄcki reported that decoding a specially crafted certificate with certain CRL distribution points format can lead to a double free. This issue was fixed in GnuTLS 3.3.14. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.14, or later versions. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-3 | [CVE-2015-6251](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6251) | Double free in certificate DN decoding | Kurt Roeckx reported that decoding a specific certificate with very long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free, which may result to a denial of service. Since the DN decoding occurs in almost all applications using certificates it is recommended to upgrade the latest GnuTLS version fixing the issue. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-2 | [No CVE assigned](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/374) | ServerKeyExchange signature issue | [Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/8132) that a ServerKeyExchange signature sent by the server is not verified to be in the acceptable by the client set of algorithms. That has the effect of allowing MD5 signatures (which are disabled by default) in the ServerKeyExchange message. It is not believed that this bug can be exploited because a fraudulent signature has to be generated in real-time which is not known to be possible. However, since attacks can only get better it is recommended to update to a GnuTLS version which addresses the issue. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.1, or 3.3.15. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2015-1 | [CVE-2015-0282](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0282) | Signature forgery | This issue only affects versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.1.0 (released in 2012). These versions don't verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential downgrade to a disallowed algorithm, such as MD5, without detecting it. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.1.0, or later. A patch will be included in gnutls\_2\_12\_x branch for the users of that version that cannot upgrade. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-5 | [CVE-2014-8564](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8564) | Denial of service | Sean Burford reported that the encoding of elliptic curves parameters GnuTLS 3 is vulnerable to a denial of service (heap corruption). It affects clients and servers which print information about the peer's public key, e.g., the key ID, and can be exploited via a specially crafted X.509 certificate. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.3.10, 3.2.20 or 3.1.28. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-4 | [CVE-2014-3566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566) | Possible plaintext recovery | This is a vulnerability on the SSL 3.0 protocol (called POODLE), which can be exploited when TLS clients use a non-standard insecure protocol negotiation (it affects mostly browsers). Clients performing the standard TLS handshake as documented by GnuTLS are not affected. [Write-up by Nikos](http://nmav.gnutls.org/2014/10/what-about-poodle.html) **Recommendation:** For clients using the documented handshake process no action is required. Clients that use the non-standard insecure negotiation should not negotiate SSL 3.0. In all cases it recommended to disable SSL 3.0 using a priority string such as "NORMAL:-VERS-SSL3.0". |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-3 | [CVE-2014-3466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466) | Memory corruption | This vulnerability affects the client side of the gnutls library. A server that sends a specially crafted ServerHello could corrupt the memory of a requesting client. [Analysis at radare.today](http://radare.today/technical-analysis-of-the-gnutls-hello-vulnerability/) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest gnutls version (3.1.25, 3.2.15 or 3.3.4) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-2 | [CVE-2014-0092](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0092) | Certificate verification issue | A vulnerability was discovered that affects the certificate verification functions of all gnutls versions. A specially crafted certificate could bypass certificate validation checks. The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of GnuTLS for Red Hat.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Anyone using certificate authentication in any version of GnuTLS.  **How are past sessions affected?**  * The vulnerability to be exploited it requires an active man-in-the-middle attacker.   Past sessions are not affected unless they were under such an attack.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version ([3.2.12](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/7341) or 3.1.22), or   apply the patch for [GnuTLS 2.12.x](https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6aa26f78150ccbdf0aec1878a41c17c41d358a3b). |
| GNUTLS-SA-2014-1 | [CVE-2014-1959](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1959) | Certificate verification issue | Suman Jana reported a vulnerability that affects the certificate verification functions of gnutls 2.11.5 and later versions. A version 1 intermediate certificate will be considered as a CA certificate by default (something that deviates from the documented behavior).  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Anyone who has a CA that issues X.509 version 1 certificates in his   trusted list.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Apply [this   patch](https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/b1abfe3d182d68539900092eb42fc62cf1bb7e7c) or upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version (3.2.11 or 3.1.21). |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-3 | [CVE-2013-4466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4466) | Denial of service | This vulnerability affects the DANE library of gnutls 3.1.x and gnutls 3.2.x. A server that returns more 4 DANE entries could corrupt the memory of a requesting client. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest gnutls version (3.1.16 or 3.2.6) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-2 | [CVE-2013-2116](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2116) | Denial of service | This vulnerability affects gnutls 2.12.23 and its TLS record decoding. **Recommendation:** Apply [the patch](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6754) or upgrade to gnutls 3.x. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2013-1 | [TLS CBC padding timing attack](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/) [CVE-2013-1619](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1619) | Possible plaintext recovery | Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson devised an attack that recovers some bits of the plaintext of a GnuTLS session that utilizes that CBC ciphersuites, by using timing information.  In order for the attack to work the client must operate as follows. It connects to a server, it sends some (encrypted) data that will be intercepted by the attacker, who will terminate the client's connection abnormally (i.e. the client will receive a premature termination error). The client should repeat that, multiple times.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Clients that repeatedly reconnect and transfer the same data, after   a TLS fatal error occurs.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Do not enable the CBC ciphersuites, prefer ARCFOUR or GCM modes. * Upgrade to the latest GnuTLS version (3.1.7, 3.0.28, or 2.12.23).  [Write-up by Nikos](http://nikmav.blogspot.be/2013/02/time-is-money-for-cbc-ciphersuites.html) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 | ["CRIME" attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/) [CVE-2012-4929](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4929) | Possible plaintext recovery | There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain circumstances.  **Who is affected by this attack?**  * Clients or servers that use compression and provide the ability to   an adversary to inject data (multiple times) in their session.  **How to mitigate the attack?**  * Do not enable compression (GnuTLS doesn't enable it by default) * When using compression use the CBC ciphers that include a random   padding up to 255 bytes. That would increase the number of trials an   attacker needs to perform significantly. Note that using compression provides [information to an attacker](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ecrypt/provpriv2012/abstracts/barghavan.pdf) on the plaintext.  [Security advisory](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6304)  [A description of the attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/)  [Another analysis of the attack](http://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2012/09/tls-crime-beast-and-you-programmer.html) |
| GNUTLS-SA-2012-3 | [CVE-2012-1569](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1569) | Denial of service | This vulnerability is in the libtasn1 library and affects the DER length decoding which is fixed in [2.12 release](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2012-03/msg00000.html). [Write-up by Mu Dynamics](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5959) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to libtasn1 2.12. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2012-2 | [CVE-2012-1573](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1573) | Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service | TLS record handling vulnerability fixed in [GnuTLS 3.0.15](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5912). [Write-up by Mu Dynamics](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5959) **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.17 or 2.12.18. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2012-1 | [CVE-2012-0390](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0390) | Timing attack (DTLS) | [Announcement of GnuTLS 3.0.11](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5657) [The paper describing the attack](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/dtls.pdf) This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform partial plaintext recovery using a timing attack in CBC-mode encryption. The attack is applicable to Datagram TLS (DTLS).  **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.11. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2011-2 | [CVE-2011-4128](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4128) | Possible buffer overflow/Denial of service | [Mailing list discussion](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/5596)  Note that this vulnerability is triggered by TLS clients that utilize the session resumption functions in a particular way. Clients that perform session resumption using the same steps as in [the example code of GnuTLS documentation](http://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Client-with-Resume-capability-example.html#Client-with-Resume-capability-example) are not vulnerable. A preliminary analysis found no vulnerable clients. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.0.7 or 2.12.14. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2011-1 | [Rizzo attack on TLS](http://www.ekoparty.org/2011/juliano-rizzo.php) | Plaintext recovery | [Mailing list discussion](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2011-09/msg00064.html)  **Recommendation:** Make use of TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 protocols that are not vulnerable to the attack. TLS 1.1 is enabled by default in GnuTLS since version 2.0.0 (released in 2007). If this is not possible, disable CBC ciphers. |
| GNUTLS-SA-2010-1 | [CVE-2010-0731](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0731) | Remote Denial of Service | [RedHat bugzilla report](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=573028) [Mailing list discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4230) This vulnerability is on a deprecated since 2006 version of GnuTLS. We keep the information here because this version was included in some distributions. **Recommendation:** Upgrade to the latest stable branch. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-19 16:41:22 UTC  ``` It was reported that gnutls in RHEL 6 and 5 has a flaw which could lead to an RSA PKCS#1 signature verification forgery. That is, gnutls doesn't verify the match of the hash algorithm listed in signature with the algorithm listed in the certificate, and that could allow a certificate to be signed with MD5 even when the algorithm is prohibited. This issue was fixed in gnutls 3.1.0.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c4)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2015-03-03 13:59:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 997548](attachment.cgi?id=997548&action=diff "Proposed patch for 2.8.5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=997548&action=edit "Proposed patch for 2.8.5") Proposed patch for 2.8.5   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c5)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-11 12:19:59 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2015-1>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c6)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-03-16 16:48:34 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  This issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the Red Hat Security Technologies Team.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c7)  Raphaël Hertzog    2015-03-23 17:07:06 UTC  ``` Nikos, I used your patch to on top of gnutls2.8.6-1+squeeze4 (for Debian LTS support) but it doesn't seem to be fully working yet. At least I can't get the test case to succeed: <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/58d7dde8a8a6fce1a8aa9aeb29f2247212fe5acd>  Before the patch, I get this: $ certtool -e --infile /tmp/invalid-sig.pem  Certificate[0]: CN=Different sig in PKCS #1 	Issued by: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Verifying against certificate[1]. 	Verification output: Verified.  Certificate[1]: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Issued by: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Verification output: Verified.  Chain verification output: Verified.  After the patch I get this: $ certtool -e --infile /tmp/invalid-sig.pem  Certificate[0]: CN=Different sig in PKCS #1 	Issued by: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Verifying against certificate[1]. 	Verification output: Not verified.  Certificate[1]: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Issued by: CN=GnuTLS Test CA 	Verification output: Verified.  Chain verification output: Not verified. $ echo $? 0  So the certificate is (as expected) not verified but this doesn't result in an error at the certtool level. Maybe it's just a bug in the old version of certtool... but I thought that it was worth pointing out.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c8)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2015-03-24 07:13:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to Raphaël Hertzog from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1194371#c7))  > Chain verification output: Not verified. > $ echo $? > 0 > So the certificate is (as expected) not verified but this doesn't result in > an error at the certtool level. Maybe it's just a bug in the old version of > certtool... but I thought that it was worth pointing out.

There are no known attacks that could lead to a forged certificate because of that, but the possibility of it is not eliminated either (it depends on whether there can be cross-signature attacks).

Package        : gnutls26
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0282 CVE-2015-0294

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GnuTLS, a library
implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2015-0282

    GnuTLS does not verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match
    the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential
    downgrade to a disallowed algorithm without detecting it.

CVE-2015-0294

    It was reported that GnuTLS does not check whether the two signature
    algorithms match on certificate import.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.

## Topic

Updated gnutls packages that fix three security issues and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

It was found that GnuTLS did not check activation and expiration dates of
CA certificates. This could cause an application using GnuTLS to
incorrectly accept a certificate as valid when its issuing CA is already
expired. (CVE-2014-8155)

It was found that GnuTLS did not verify whether a hashing algorithm listed
in a signature matched the hashing algorithm listed in the certificate.
An attacker could create a certificate that used a different hashing
algorithm than it claimed, possibly causing GnuTLS to use an insecure,
disallowed hashing algorithm during certificate verification.
(CVE-2015-0282)

It was discovered that GnuTLS did not check if all sections of X.509
certificates indicate the same signature algorithm. This flaw, in
combination with a different flaw, could possibly lead to a bypass of the
certificate signature check. (CVE-2015-0294)

The CVE-2014-8155 issue was discovered by Marcel Kolaja of Red Hat.
The CVE-2015-0282 and CVE-2015-0294 issues were discovered by Nikos
Mavrogiannopoulos of the Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, under certain circumstances, the certtool utility could

generate X.509 certificates which contained a negative modulus.
Consequently, such certificates could have interoperation problems with the
software using them. The bug has been fixed, and certtool no longer
generates X.509 certificates containing a negative modulus. (BZ#1036385)

Users of gnutls are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
