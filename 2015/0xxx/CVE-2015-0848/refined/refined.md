{
  "CVE-2015-0848": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow in libwmf when decoding BMP images.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect calculation of image size in `ReadBMPImage` function which is called during the processing of BMP data within a WMF file. The subsequent `DecodeImage` function then writes beyond the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.",
    "Attack vectors": "By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file, an attacker can trigger the overflow. The crafted WMF file contains malicious BMP data that exploits the vulnerability in `libwmf`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious WMF file with specific BMP image data. No user authentication is required. User interaction is required to open the malicious WMF file."
