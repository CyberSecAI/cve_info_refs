Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0780:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query within the `GetReRequestData` method of the `GetStoredResult` class in Novell Zenworks. This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This occurs because unsanitized user-provided data is directly incorporated into a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the database server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit it.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Authentication is not required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Zenworks server over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or authentication to exploit the flaw, making it easily exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that Novell (now Micro Focus) has released a patch to address this and other related vulnerabilities, which is available for various versions of Zenworks.
*   This vulnerability was identified and reported by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS score of 6.8.

In summary, CVE-2015-0780 is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for remote code execution without authentication, stemming from a SQL injection flaw.
