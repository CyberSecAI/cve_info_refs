Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how `dpkg-source` parses OpenPGP Armor Header Lines within Debian source control files (.dsc). Specifically, the parser incorrectly handled whitespace characters following the header, allowing for a specially crafted .dsc file to bypass signature verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `dpkg-source` tool didn't strictly enforce whitespace rules in OpenPGP Armor Header Lines, accepting more than just `\r`, `\t`, and space . This allowed crafted header lines to be misinterpreted, leading to signature bypass.
*   **Signature Bypass:** Due to the flawed parsing logic, the integrity checks of source packages could be circumvented.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Compromise:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a Debian source package while bypassing the usual signature verification.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, the ability to bypass signature checks on local source packages could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if a user or system were tricked into unpacking a malicious package.
*   **Trust Issue:** This vulnerability undermines the trust in Debian source package integrity, as users could not rely on signatures to confirm the authenticity of local source packages.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Debian Source Control Files (.dsc):** The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious `.dsc` file with specially crafted OpenPGP Armor Header Lines.
*   **Local Source Package Extraction:**  Exploitation is specific to the extraction of local Debian source packages using `dpkg-source`, not affecting package installation from the Debian archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious .dsc File:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Debian source control file (.dsc) with crafted header lines.
*   **Social Engineering/Trickery:** The attacker needs to convince a user or automated system to use `dpkg-source` to extract the malicious source package.
*   **Local Access (potentially):** Although the attack vector is through a file, some of the sources mention a 'remote attacker' which likely means the attacker does not need to be on the same system as the victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `dpkg-source` tool.
*   The fix involves adjusting the parsing logic for OpenPGP Armor Header Lines to only accept `\r`, `\t` and space as valid trailing whitespace characters and aligning the implementation with GnuPG's implementation.
