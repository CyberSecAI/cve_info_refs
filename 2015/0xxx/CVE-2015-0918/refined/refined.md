Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-0918 (Although the advisory mentions "CVE-ID: -" it is highly likely this vulnerability is referring to CVE-2015-0918 based on the timeline and description)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `searchterm` parameter in the backend administrative interface of CMS Sefrengo v1.6.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application directly includes the unsanitized input from the `searchterm` parameter into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the administrative backend.
- This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal administrator session cookies.
    - **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform administrative actions on behalf of the logged-in administrator.
    - **Defacement:** An attacker could deface the administrative interface.
    - **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or force malware downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker crafts a URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `searchterm` parameter and sends it to a victim, likely an administrator.
- When the victim clicks on the malicious URL, the injected JavaScript is executed in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and get a victim (likely a system administrator) to click on it.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is in the format: `<http://{TARGET}/backend/main.php?area=user&idgroup=0&order=&ascdesc=ASC&searchterm=[MALICIOUS_CODE]&page=1>`
- The `searchterm` parameter is directly rendered in the HTML output without sanitization.
- Example malicious payload:  `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

**Additional Notes from Forum:**
- The developers addressed the XSS vulnerability by converting the searchterm to HTML entities.
- A separate issue was found related to non-numeric variables. The code was updated to escape strings before DB queries. This was another attempt to prevent SQL injection.
- The forum thread shows a discussion on the best ways to mitigate the vulnerability.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Sefrengo CMS administrative backend. An attacker can inject malicious code using the searchterm parameter, leading to potential session hijacking, administrative access, and other malicious activities.
