      ],
      "root_cause": "Improper processing of crafted TCP packets.",
      "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper processing of crafted TCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP packet that needs to be processed by the AppNav component configured on an affected device.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or execute arbitrary code in the forwarding engine.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker.",
       "additional_details": "The device is only vulnerable if multiple AppNav-XE controllers are configured. This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 TCP packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability. The AppNav-XE controller component is not enabled by default."
