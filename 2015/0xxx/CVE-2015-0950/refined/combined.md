5.1.11 is released. It contains a major security update. Thanks to Daniel Compton @ Info-Assure and [Yasser Ali](https://yasserali.com/) for reports! For the sake of security we will not share in public the details of the vulnerability found, but we strongly recommend that you upgrade the store asap. This is a critical vulnerability you do not want to linger on in your production store. You’re welcome to [contact us](https://www.x-cart.com/contact) if you have questions or need any kind of assistance.

In addition to the security update, the new version contains several minor fixes:

* PayPal Advanced vs many products in the cart
* Coupons vs PayPal issue
* Bug-fix in the “Product Variants” module
* Good news for those who run version 5.0.14 and could not upgrade the store to v.5.1.10: the problem is fixed and you will manage to upgrade to v.5.1.11 easily.
