The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin describing multiple vulnerabilities addressed in a cumulative update for Internet Explorer.  CVE-2015-0020 is one of the vulnerabilities addressed by this bulletin.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2015-0020:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause of CVE-2015-0020 is a memory corruption vulnerability that arises from improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Memory Corruption: Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
*   Privilege Escalation: An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   Full System Control: Attackers could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Web-based attack:
    *   The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker convinces a user to view the malicious website via social engineering (e.g., clicking a link).
    *   Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could also be used to host the exploit.
*   Email:
    *   An attacker could send an email with a link to a malicious website, or with a specially crafted attachment that exploits the vulnerability upon opening.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to host or control access to a website with specially crafted content.
*   The attacker must convince the victim to interact with the malicious content (e.g. visit the crafted website).
*   The attacker can be remote, and does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
* The bulletin states that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited prior to the release of this patch.
* The severity rating is "Critical" for affected Windows client operating systems, and "Moderate" for affected Windows server operating systems.
* The bulletin addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
* Affected versions include Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on various Windows client and server platforms.
