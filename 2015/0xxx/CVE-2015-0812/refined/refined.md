Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that lightweight themes in Mozilla Firefox could be installed from Mozilla subdomains over HTTP (unencrypted) connections without requiring user approval, while regular add-ons require explicit user confirmation. This is due to the add-on manager itself not enforcing HTTPS checks for lightweight themes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of HTTPS Enforcement:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a requirement for HTTPS when installing lightweight themes from certain Mozilla subdomains. This contrasts with the more secure handling of regular add-ons.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Potential:**  The absence of HTTPS enforcement creates an opportunity for MITM attacks. An attacker could intercept the communication between the user's browser and a Mozilla subdomain, and inject malicious lightweight themes.
*   **Trust Exploitation:**  The vulnerability exploits the implicit trust that users place in Mozilla domains, potentially leading to the installation of unwanted themes without their awareness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing User Confirmation:** An attacker can install lightweight themes without the user's explicit consent, which differs from the expected behavior where a confirmation prompt is displayed before the installation.
*  **Theme Spoofing:** A MITM attack allows for spoofing of legitimate Mozilla subdomains, potentially leading a user to unknowingly accept themes from malicious sites.
*  **Potential Tracking:** While lightweight themes have limited access, an attacker could inject a theme with a malicious update URL, enabling tracking of the user's IP during update requests.
*   **Limited, but Potentially Annoying:** While lightweight themes can easily be undone, an unwanted theme may be surprising and possibly offensive to a user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** A MITM attacker intercepts the communication between the victim's browser and a Mozilla subdomain.
*   **DNS Spoofing:** The attacker could use DNS spoofing to redirect the victim's browser to a malicious server masquerading as a legitimate Mozilla subdomain.
*  **HTTP Requests:** Malicious HTTP traffic is used to install the themes without proper validation of the origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the victim and the target Mozilla subdomain. This might involve a local network MITM or the ability to perform DNS spoofing to reroute requests.
*   **Ability to serve HTTP:** The attacker needs a server to host and serve the malicious lightweight theme content via HTTP.
*   **Domain Spoofing:** The attacker must control a domain or subdomain, or use DNS spoofing that is similar to the official one. For example `evil.addons.mozilla.org`

**Additional Notes:**
*  The issue is not limited to themes, it exposes all addon-related permissions for specified domains.
*  The vulnerability is specific to lightweight themes, as regular add-ons still require the standard user confirmation.
*  A fix was implemented to require HTTPS for add-on installations from web pages, addressing the exposed permission issue.
*  The severity was considered "moderate" due to the lack of permanent damage and existence of confirmations for regular addon installs, although the spoofing of AMO was a concern.
*  The fix was eventually uplifted to Firefox 37 and was not included in Firefox ESR31.
*  The `extensions.install.requireSecureOrigin` preference was introduced to allow HTTP installs for enterprise environments, but this was not for lightweight themes.
