# RHSA-2015:0080 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.8.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.8.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 8 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6549, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591,
CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403,
CVE-2015-0406, CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412,
CVE-2015-0413, CVE-2015-0421, CVE-2015-0437)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

Note: With this update, the Oracle Java SE now disables the SSL 3.0
protocol to address the CVE-2014-3566 issue (also known as POODLE). Refer
to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section for
instructions on how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed.

All users of java-1.8.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 8 Update 31 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 6 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include  [Oracle Database](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015.html#AppendixDB) and  [Oracle Fusion Middleware](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015.html#AppendixFMW) components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2015),  [My Oracle Support Note 1954250.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1954250.1).

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.
