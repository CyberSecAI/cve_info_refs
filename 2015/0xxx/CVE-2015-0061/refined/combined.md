## Vulnerability Information

## TIFF Processing Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0061

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows fails to properly handle uninitialized memory when parsing certain, specially crafted TIFF image format files. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker runs a specially crafted application on an affected system.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. This could also include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read data which was not intended to be disclosed. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows processes TIFF image format files.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
