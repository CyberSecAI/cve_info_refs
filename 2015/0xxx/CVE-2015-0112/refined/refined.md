- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error in IBM Jazz Foundation when processing XML data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information by sending specially crafted XML data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, using specially crafted XML data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send specially-crafted XML data to the vulnerable system. Authentication is mentioned in the CVSS vector (Au:S) so the attacker requires to be a valid user.
