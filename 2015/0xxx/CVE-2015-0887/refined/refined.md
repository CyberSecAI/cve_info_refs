**Root Cause:** A flaw in the processing of SSTP packets within the PPP Access Concentrator (PPPAC) of SEIL series routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper handling of specially crafted SSTP packets.
*   Vulnerable PPPAC (npppd) program that loops when processing crafted packets

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS).
*   Device becomes unresponsive.
*   High CPU resource consumption
*   The PPPAC functionality can be stopped.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Sending a specially crafted SSTP packet to a vulnerable router

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
*   The router must have SSTP server (pppac protocol sstp) enabled for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Affected Products:**
*   SEIL/B1 versions 3.50 to 4.70
*   SEIL/X1 versions 3.50 to 4.70
*   SEIL/X2 versions 3.50 to 4.70
*  SEIL/x86 Fuji versions 1.00 to 3.30

**Mitigation:**
* Update the firmware to the following versions or later:
    *  SEIL/x86 Fuji 3.31
    *  SEIL/X1 4.71
    *  SEIL/X2 4.71
    *  SEIL/B1 4.71
