Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow within the logging functionality of the ZENworks Preboot Policy Service. This service listens on port 13331.
- The logging functionality copies attacker-provided data into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow:  The vulnerability occurs when the logging functionality attempts to write more data into the buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker's code is executed with the privileges of the local user `__z_0_1__`, which has Administrator rights, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network because the affected service listens on port 13331.
- Unauthenticated: Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability, meaning any attacker who can reach port 13331 can attempt the exploit.
- Data Injection: The attacker sends specially crafted data which is then copied into the undersized buffer through the logging functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity to the vulnerable server's port 13331
- Ability to send network data to the vulnerable service.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**
- Novell (now Micro Focus) released a patch to address this vulnerability which can be found on their website.
- The vulnerability was reported by ZDI.
