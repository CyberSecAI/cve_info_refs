**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The course summary displayed on the course request pending approval page was not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The unescaped course summary allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** The text mentions "Privilege Escalation?" which indicates that successful XSS could lead to unauthorized actions by the attacker, potentially escalating their privileges within the Moodle system if they can manipulate the manager's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with the ability to request a course can insert malicious javascript in the course summary.
- A manager viewing the course request pending approval page would execute the javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an enrolled user with the ability to request a course. They must also be able to add a malicious javascript in the course summary.
- The attacker needs to target a Moodle manager that will view the course request page.
