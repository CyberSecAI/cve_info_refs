Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how Cacti processes user input for the 'local_graph_id' parameter in the `graph.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to insert arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database interactions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Queries:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This may lead to:
  - **Confidentiality Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data in the database.
  - **Integrity Impact:**  Modification or deletion of data in the database.
  - **Availability Impact:** Potential denial of service by disrupting database operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker with network access.
- **Web Application:** The attack vector is via the web interface of the Cacti application through the `graph.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Cacti web application.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to the Cacti instance.
