## Vulnerability in Group Policy Could Allow Security Feature Bypass (3004361)

Published: February 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if an attacker, by way of a man-in-the-middle attack, causes the Group Policy Security Configuration Engine policy file on a targeted system to become corrupted or otherwise unreadable. This results in the Group Policy settings on the system to revert to their default, and potentially less secure, state.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Group Policy settings are applied when the Security Configuration Engine policy file is corrupted or otherwise unreadable. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3004361](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3004361).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## Vulnerability Information

## Group Policy Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0009

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the Group Policy application of Security Configuration policies that could cause Group Policy settings on a targeted system to revert to their default, and potentially less secure, state. An attacker could accomplish this by way of a man-in-the-middle attack that modifies domain controller responses to client requests.

Workstations and servers that are configured to use Group Policy are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Group Policy settings are applied when the Security Configuration Engine policy file is corrupted or otherwise unreadable.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
