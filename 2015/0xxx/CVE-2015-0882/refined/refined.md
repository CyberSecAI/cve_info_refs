Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the Zen Cart Japanese version, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input, specifically within the GET parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browser of a user who is logged in as an administrator. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing the administrator's session cookie, gaining control of the admin account.
    - Defacement: Altering the appearance or content of the website.
    - Data theft: Stealing sensitive data accessible to the administrator.
    - Malicious actions: Performing unauthorized actions on the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via network access, meaning that an attacker can trigger it remotely.
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs with specially crafted GET parameters. These are then accessed by an administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get an administrator to load a malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability; they only need to convince an administrator user to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Zen Cart Japanese versions 1.5.1 ja and earlier, and 1.3.0.2 jp8 and earlier.
- The fix involves applying a patch or updating to the latest version.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `init_sanitize.php` files which were modified to sanitize GET parameters with `preg_replace`. The changes are meant to remove specific characters that might be used for XSS.
- The provided GitHub commit link shows the specific changes made to address the XSS vulnerability in the `init_sanitize.php` files within the `admin/includes/init_includes` and `includes/init_includes` directories. This included adding more sanitization rules for GET parameters.
