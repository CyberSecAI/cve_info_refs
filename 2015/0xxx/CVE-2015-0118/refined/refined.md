- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM MQ client JAR files included with the WebSphere Message Broker Toolkit and IBM Integration Toolkit are back level and do not support stronger TLS cipher suites. This prevents the toolkit from connecting to a remote WebSphere Message Broker or IBM Integration Bus node when using a TLS-compliant cipher.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of outdated libraries. The IBM MQ client JARs lack support for modern TLS cipher suites.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The toolkit cannot connect to a remote message broker/bus node with a TLS-compliant cipher. The impact is a loss of functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the toolkit attempts to connect to a remote server with a TLS-compliant cipher.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability. The problem is present due to software deficiencies. An attacker may attempt to leverage this if they control the remote server and force use of TLS ciphers not supported by the toolkit. The security bulletin indicates an attacker is not needed since the issue occurs by default when the condition is met.
