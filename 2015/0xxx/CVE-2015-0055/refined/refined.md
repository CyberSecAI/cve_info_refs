The provided documents contain information about CVE-2015-0055.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This can allow scripts to run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper permission validation in Internet Explorer, which allows elevation of privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.
- By itself this vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution, but it could be combined with another vulnerability like remote code execution to run code with elevated privileges. For example, arbitrary code could be run with limited permissions, and then this vulnerability could be used to cause the arbitrary code to run with medium integrity level (current user's permissions).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker could host a website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content could be used to deliver malicious content.
- Attackers would have to convince users to visit the malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or leverage a compromised website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website, for example, by using social engineering tactics like tricking the user to click on a link.
