{
  "CVE-2015-0247": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A boundary check error in the libext2fs library when handling block group descriptor information.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted filesystem image",
      "Local access via crafted filesystem images, especially through automounting"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a crafted filesystem image that will be parsed by vulnerable tools like `fsck`, `dumpe2fs`, `e2image` etc. The attacker can either have direct local access to the machine, or entice the victim to mount the crafted image, which triggers the vulnerability."
