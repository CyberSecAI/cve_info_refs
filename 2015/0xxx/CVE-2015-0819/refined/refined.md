Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the UITour API not properly restricting calls from background tabs. Specifically, whitelisted Mozilla domains could execute UITour API calls even when the UI Tour pages were in background tabs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** The UITour API did not differentiate between foreground and background tabs, allowing actions from background tabs to affect the foreground.
*   **Spoofing/Clickjacking Potential:** A compromised whitelisted domain could exploit the API to display deceptive UI elements in the foreground tab, potentially leading to clickjacking or other spoofing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UI Spoofing:** An attacker could display a fake UI element (info panel) in the browser chrome, potentially covering the address bar, making it hard for users to see the true URL.
*  **Clickjacking:** Attackers could trick users into performing actions they didn't intend to by overlaying the fake UI element on top of the actual webpage. This could lead to unintended consequences like, for example, submitting sensitive information or purchasing products.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Whitelisted Domain:** The primary attack vector requires an attacker to compromise a whitelisted Mozilla domain.
*   **Background Tab Execution:** The attacker would need to have their malicious code execute from a background tab of the compromised whitelisted domain.
*   **UITour API Call:** The malicious code would utilize the UITour API (specifically `showInfo`) to display spoofed UI in a foreground tab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Compromise a Whitelisted Domain:** The attacker needs control of a site on the Mozilla UITour whitelist.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute Javascript in the compromised domain.
*   **User Interaction:**  While not a direct interaction like a click, user needs to have a foreground tab open and be on a whitelisted domain for the attack to be successful.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as "sec-moderate", which means that it is not a trivial exploit but not the most serious either.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 36.
*   The vulnerability was initially introduced in Firefox 29 with the initial landing of the UITour feature.
*   Patches were created for Mozilla Central, Aurora and Beta branches as a fix and were later backported.

In summary, CVE-2015-0819 is a moderate severity security vulnerability that could lead to UI spoofing and clickjacking through exploitation of the UITour API via a compromised whitelisted domain.
