Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0514:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of remote server credentials within EMC M&R (Watch4net). These credentials are encrypted using a fixed, hardcoded password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The primary weakness is the use of a static, hardcoded password for encrypting sensitive data. This makes the encryption easily reversible if the key is exposed.
*  **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Remote server credentials, critical for accessing and monitoring systems, are stored in an encrypted form, but the encryption mechanism is weak.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Credential compromise:** An attacker who obtains the encrypted credentials can easily decrypt them using the known hardcoded password.
*   **Unauthorized access:** With the decrypted credentials, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the remote servers managed by EMC M&R (Watch4net)
*   **Data Breach:** This access can lead to data breaches, manipulation, or further compromise of the affected systems and the environment that they monitor.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Access to the encrypted credentials:** The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the location where the encrypted credentials are stored. This could occur through various means such as network intrusion, insider threat, or compromised backups.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to encrypted credentials:** An attacker must have access to the encrypted credential store from the affected EMC M&R (Watch4net) system. This may require access to the server's file system, database, or backup files.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the hardcoded encryption key or have the means to discover it by analyzing the software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects EMC M&R (Watch4Net) versions prior to 6.5u1 and EMC ViPR SRM versions prior to 3.6.1.
*   EMC has released updated versions of both products to address this vulnerability.
*   The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how an attacker could decrypt these credentials using Java code, specifically the `com.watch4net.apg.v2.common.config.tools.Utils.process()` method.
