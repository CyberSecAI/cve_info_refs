- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user roles in Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper user role validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges on the VMM server and take control of all virtual machines managed by that server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have valid Active Directory logon credentials and be able to log on to the affected system (VMM server).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid Active Directory credentials and the ability to log on to the VMM server.
