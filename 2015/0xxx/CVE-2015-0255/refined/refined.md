  "CVE-2015-0255": {
    "description": "The X.Org X server incorrectly handled XkbSetGeometry requests, leading to an information leak. An attacker able to connect to an X server, either locally or remotely, could use this issue to possibly obtain sensitive information. Additionally, the X.Org server incorrectly handled XkbGetGeometry requests, which could lead to an information leak or a denial of service. A malicious, authorized client could use this flaw to disclose portions of the X.Org server memory or cause the X.Org server to crash using a specially crafted XkbGetGeometry request. The vulnerability stems from the server trusting the client to send valid string lengths in the request data.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The X server trusts client-provided string lengths in XkbSetGeometry and XkbGetGeometry requests without proper validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing input validation",
        "Buffer over-read",
        "Information leak",
        "Potential denial of service"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information from the X server's memory and/or cause the X server to crash (denial of service).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious client connects to the X server (either locally or remotely)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to send X11 protocol requests to the server.",
    "affected_components" : [
	"xorg-server",
        "tigervnc",
        "x11-server"
	    ],
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists since X11R6.6 (March 1996).  The server may copy adjacent memory data into XKB structs due to client-provided invalid string lengths."
