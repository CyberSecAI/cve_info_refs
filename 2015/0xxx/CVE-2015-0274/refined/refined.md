  "CVE-2015-0274": {
    "description": "Eric Windisch discovered flaw in how the Linux kernel's XFS file system replaces remote attributes. A local access with access to an XFS file system could exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the Linux kernel's XFS file system handles replacing of remote attributes. When replacing a remote attribute, the lookup which finds the existing remote attribute overwrites the `args->valuelen` parameter with the length of the remote attribute being replaced. Consequently, when creating the new attribute, it is created with the size of the existing remote attribute instead of the intended size. When the new attribute is much smaller, a transaction overrun occurs.",

      "Memory Corruption",
       "Privilege Escalation",
