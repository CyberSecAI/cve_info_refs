  "CVE-2015-0290": {
    "description": "The multiblock feature in the ssl3_write_bytes function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a on 64-bit x86 platforms with AES NI support does not properly handle certain non-blocking I/O cases, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pointer corruption and application crash) via unspeciÔ¨Åed vectors.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of non-blocking I/O cases in the multiblock feature of OpenSSL's ssl3_write_bytes function on 64-bit x86 platforms with AES NI support.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory management",
      "Improper handling of non-blocking I/O"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to pointer corruption and application crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send crafted packets to a vulnerable OpenSSL instance. Exploitation would likely require an application using a socket BIO for writing, to use a different type of BIO or to encounter a failed connection."
