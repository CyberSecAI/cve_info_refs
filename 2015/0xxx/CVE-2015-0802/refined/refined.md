    "content": "The provided documents describe CVE-2015-0802, a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that allows for potential remote code execution by bypassing same-origin policy restrictions. Specifically:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from Firefox relying on docshell type information instead of page principal information for Window.webidl access control. This means that if a content script can obtain a reference to a chrome window (which should not normally happen), it can navigate this window to its own page and access chrome-privileged APIs.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Incorrect access control based on docshell type rather than page principal.\n-  Persistence of access to restricted internal methods of a privileged window after navigation to unprivileged content.\n-  Bypass of the Same Origin Policy (SOP).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n-  Arbitrary JavaScript code execution with chrome privileges.\n-   Potential remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Remote attackers can exploit this flaw by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website.\n- Requires an additional vulnerability that would provide the initial access to a chrome window from web content\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to host or inject a malicious webpage that can be accessed by the vulnerable Firefox browser.\n- Exploit must be able to initially obtain a reference to a chrome privileged window from web content",
