Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2015-0830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

-   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the WebGL implementation, specifically within the shader compilation process. When WebGL content writes strings, a crash can occur when the shader compilation log attempts to use `strcpy` with unallocated memory. The root issue is that `ShGetInfo` could return a zero size log, which was not handled correctly, and then `strcpy` would attempt to write to an invalid memory location, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is related to improper memory management during WebGL shader compilation, particularly within the `strcpy` function where no memory is allocated if the shader compilation log is zero bytes. The `strcpy` function could attempt to write to a static memory location that does not belong to the allocation, which will result in a crash.
-   **Lack of Input Validation:** There's an insufficient check for the length of the shader compilation log before copying it, which leads to the allocation of zero bytes of memory. This lack of proper input validation enables the out-of-bounds write.
-   **Denial of Service:** This vulnerability causes a crash, leading to a denial of service, disrupting normal web browsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** A malicious website with crafted WebGL content can crash the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can exploit this by hosting a specially crafted website that contains malicious WebGL content. The attack is triggered when a user visits the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Web-Based:** An attacker only needs to host a malicious webpage. The user must visit the site with a vulnerable browser.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix addresses cases where the shader compilation log is empty. The corrected code skips the copying of empty strings in such cases.
-   The bug is rated as "sec-moderate" since it only leads to a crash and is not easily exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
-   The vulnerability affects multiple products, including Firefox, Firefox OS, and SeaMonkey.
-   The fix was applied to multiple branches.
-   The crash happens during the call to  `strcpy()`  because of `mozilla::WebGLContext::CompileShader` trying to copy zero-length info log.
-   The security fix prevents the crash by adding a check to avoid copying zero length strings.
