Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of a capability check in the AJAX backend script of the LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) module within Moodle. Specifically, the `mod/lti/ajax.php` file was missing the necessary checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks. This allows users to access functionality and data they should not have access to.
- **Missing Capability Check:**  The AJAX script does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions or capabilities to perform the requested actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Any enrolled user could exploit this vulnerability to search and view the list of registered LTI tools. This could reveal information about the tools integrated into the Moodle platform, potentially exposing sensitive data or platform configurations. The severity of risk is considered minor, suggesting that the information leaked is not critical.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack vector involves exploiting the `mod/lti/ajax.php` script through network requests.
- **AJAX Request:** A malicious or curious user could send a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable script, triggering the information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Enrolled User:** The attacker needs to be an enrolled user in the Moodle platform. They do not need special or elevated privileges.
- **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to make HTTP requests, specifically AJAX requests, to the target script.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 2.8 to 2.8.1, 2.7 to 2.7.3, 2.6 to 2.6.6, and earlier unsupported versions are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle versions 2.8.2, 2.7.4, and 2.6.7.
- **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is classified as "Minor".
- The commit message "MDL-47920 mod_lti: add capability checks, http headers" suggests that the fix involved adding the missing capability checks to the relevant code and also included the addition of HTTP headers.
