Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **cleartext transmission of user credentials**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** User credentials are sent in clear text when connecting to the server, allowing malicious actors to intercept and access the control system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows malicious actors to gain access to the control system by intercepting user credentials during transmission. The impact is classified as a potential compromise of confidentiality (CVSS base score of 3.3).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is an **adjacent network** (AV:A)
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting the network traffic where the credentials are sent in cleartext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be positioned on the same adjacent network to intercept the network traffic where user credentials are being transmitted.
*   The attacker needs minimal skills to exploit the vulnerability as specified in the "difficulty" section. (Low Skill)
