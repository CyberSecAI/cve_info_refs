- While the information disclosure vulnerability does not directly allow arbitrary code execution, it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass security features such as Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted website or by opening a specially crafted file.
- In the case of a web-based attack, the attacker could host a website containing a malicious web page.
- Exploitation may also occur if the user opens a malicious attachment received in an email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious font file or website.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious site or opening the malicious file.
- No special privileges are needed on the victim's system.
