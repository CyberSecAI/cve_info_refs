Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the Maroyaka Simple Board CGI script. This occurs because the script doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to sanitize user-provided text input, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and displayed to other users. This is a type of vulnerability where injected malicious script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a file system, or in a log file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of users who access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Defacing web pages
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
    - Obtaining sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the "Maroyaka Simple Board," where attackers can inject malicious script when submitting text.
- The injected script is stored persistently.
- Other users viewing the stored text will have the malicious script executed in their browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to post text via the vulnerable Maroyaka Simple Board interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious script code.

**Additional details:**

*   The affected product is Maroyaka Simple Board version 1.10 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (network access).
*   The vulnerability does not impact confidentiality or availability, only integrity.
*   The vendor released a fix on March 4, 2015, after initially stating they would not maintain the product.
