- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption in Internet Explorer due to improper handling of objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can host a specially crafted website and convince the user to view it. Alternatively, compromised or user-content-hosting websites could be used to deliver the exploit. The user has to take action to visit the attacker controlled website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a website with the malicious code and convince the user to visit it.
