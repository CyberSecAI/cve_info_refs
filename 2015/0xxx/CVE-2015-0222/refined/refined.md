{
  "CVE-2015-0222": {
    "description": "Given a form that uses ModelMultipleChoiceField and show_hidden_initial=True (not a documented API), it was possible for a user to cause an unreasonable number of SQL queries by submitting duplicate values for the field's data. The validation logic in ModelMultipleChoiceField now deduplicates submitted values to address this issue.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The ModelMultipleChoiceField did not deduplicate submitted values when show_hidden_initial was set to True.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation leading to excessive database queries."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by submitting duplicate values, leading to a large number of SQL queries and database resource exhaustion.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote user submits a form with duplicate values in a ModelMultipleChoiceField when show_hidden_initial is set to True.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to submit forms, and the vulnerable application must have a form that uses ModelMultipleChoiceField and set show_hidden_initial=True"
    }
