Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the DEC DNA Routing Protocol dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, a flaw exists in how the `set_dnet_address` function handles memory allocation and the copying of addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Crash Vulnerability:** The core issue is a crash caused by the dissector when processing malformed packets. This occurs when `SET_ADDRESS` is called with a target address which may be in freed memory.
- **Memory Handling:** Improper memory management within the `set_dnet_address` function which leads to the crash due to referencing potentially freed memory.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:**  The dissector does not properly validate or sanitize the incoming packet data, allowing malformed packets to trigger the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by convincing a user to open a malicious capture file, an attacker can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to a denial of service. This impacts the availability of the tool for network analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a malformed packet into the network traffic that a vulnerable Wireshark instance is monitoring.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can create a malicious packet capture file that exploits the vulnerability and convince a user to open it in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to inject packets into a network that is being monitored by a vulnerable Wireshark instance or to be able to send malicous capture files to a user.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing any authentication or user credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves correcting the memory handling within the `set_dnet_address` function and ensuring that memory used by `SET_ADDRESS` is valid.
- Some sources suggest a fix that uses `ep_strdup()` instead of  `wmem_strdup()` for memory handling of the address.
- This vulnerability and the fix have been addressed in multiple Wireshark releases 1.12.3 and 1.10.12

This vulnerability is rated as moderate by Red Hat and openSUSE.
