## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) is vulnerable to cross-site
  scripting (XSS) because user-supplied input is improperly
  neutralized in some error situations. A remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted URL to
  run a script in your web browser within the security context of
  the hosting web site when the URL is clicked. An attacker could
  use this vulnerability to steal your cookie-based authentication
  credentials.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED
  IBM BPM Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  IBM Process Portal might return unvalidated user input in some
  error situations, which results in a cross-site scripting (XSS)
  vulnerability if the user-supplied input contains an executable
  script.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix will be available for the latest fix pack of all supported
  and affected releases that replace the stack traces with
  generic messages.

  To see if a fix is available for your release, go to Fix Central
  (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral) and search for JR52626:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
  the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
  2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR52626, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.
