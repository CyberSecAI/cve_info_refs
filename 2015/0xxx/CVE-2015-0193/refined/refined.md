Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of user-supplied input in error situations within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE). Specifically, when errors occur, the system might return user-provided input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, arising from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in error handling within IBM Process Portal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Script Execution:** A remote attacker can inject and execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser within the security context of the hosting website. This occurs when a user clicks a specially crafted URL.
*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability to steal a victim's cookie-based authentication credentials, potentially leading to session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes malicious script code as user-supplied input.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must click on the crafted URL for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't require prior access to the system.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs containing malicious script.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers might need to use some form of social engineering to entice a user to click on the malicious URL.

**Affected Products:**
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard V7.5.x.x through 8.5.5.0
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Express V7.5.x.x through 8.5.5.0
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced V7.5.x.x through 8.5.5.0
*   WebSphere Lombardi Edition (WLE) 7.2

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the interim fix for APAR JR52626 as appropriate for your version of IBM BPM or WLE.
*   Users should be advised not to click on links in emails as a precaution.
