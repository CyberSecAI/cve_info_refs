Package        : nbd
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7441 CVE-2015-0847
Debian Bug     : 781547 784657

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen discovered that unsafe signal handling in nbd-server, the
server for the Network Block Device protocol, could allow remote
attackers to cause a deadlock in the server process and thus a denial of
service.

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen also discovered that the modern-style negotiation was
carried out in the main server process before forking the actual client
handler. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
(crash) by querying a non-existent export. This issue only affected the
oldstable distribution (wheezy).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.2-4~deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.8-4+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.10-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.

# USN-2676-1: NBD vulnerabilities

22 July 2015

Several security issues were fixed in NBD.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [nbd](/security/cves?package=nbd) - Network Block Device protocol

## Details

It was discovered that NBD incorrectly handled IP address matching. A

remote attacker could use this issue with an IP address that has a partial

match and bypass access restrictions. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6410](/security/CVE-2013-6410))

Tuomas Räsänen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled wrong export names

and closed connections during negotiation. A remote attacker could use this

issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7441](/security/CVE-2013-7441))

Tuomas Räsänen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled signals. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-0847](/security/CVE-2015-0847))

Message-ID: <87d22c2k2a.fsf@mid.deneb.enyo.de>

Subject: CVE-2015-0847 in nbd-server

nbd-server uses signal handlers incorrectly, which leads to a denial
of service vulnerability.  We have assigned CVE-2015-0847 to this
vulnerability.

This was first reported to the Debian security team by Tuomas Räsänen,
but we did not think this warranted an embargo.

More details are available upstream:

  <<http://sourceforge.net/p/nbd/mailman/message/34091218/>>
