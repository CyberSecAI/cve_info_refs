    "description": "The ssl3_client_hello function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not ensure that the PRNG is seeded before proceeding with a handshake, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by sniffing the network and then conducting a brute-force attack.",
