  "CVE-2015-0432": {
    "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL Server 5.5.40 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to affect availability via vectors related to Server : InnoDB : DDL : Foreign Key.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability within the MySQL Server's InnoDB component, specifically related to Data Definition Language (DDL) operations involving Foreign Keys.",
       "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of DDL operations related to foreign keys within the InnoDB storage engine.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition, characterized by a server hang or crash. This can make the database unavailable to legitimate users.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a network-based attack. It is described as easily exploitable through multiple protocols. This means that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted network requests to the MySQL server.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the network to exploit this vulnerability. Multiple authentications may be required"

     "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is related to other MySQL vulnerabilities fixed in the same timeframe. The specific fix involves changes in how temporary files are handled in MyISAM and how foreign keys are managed within InnoDB. Some reports suggest that while the issue is technically a local exploitation, it can be triggered remotely through database connections."
