Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `checkpw` program's processing of account names containing double dashes (`--`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The program fails to properly handle or sanitize input containing double dashes in account names.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability leads to an infinite loop, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing an account name with double dashes. This consumes CPU time and makes the system or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Network Access: The attacker does not require local access to exploit it; the vulnerability is accessible over a network.
- Input manipulation: The attacker provides a specially crafted input (an account name with double dashes)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `checkpw` program or system that uses the vulnerable code.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity (CVSS Base Score of 5.0).
- The vulnerability was reported by Hiroya Ito of GMO Pepabo, Inc.
- The fix for this issue is to update the `checkpw` package to version 1.02-1+deb7u1 (wheezy), 1.02-1.1 (jessie), or 1.02-1.1 (sid) or later.
-  The vulnerability is present in checkpw version 1.02 and earlier.
