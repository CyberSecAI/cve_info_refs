- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). Specifically, there is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the default search box of `http://<HOST_NAME>:8080/searchblox/plugin/index.html` and a persistent XSS vulnerability in the title field of the 'Create Featured Result' form at `http://<HOST_NAME>:8080/searchblox/admin/main.jsp?menu1=res`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session, the application, or an authenticated user. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - For the reflected XSS, an attacker would likely craft a malicious URL with script injected into the search parameter and trick a user into clicking the link.
    - For the persistent XSS, an attacker would need to be authenticated to add malicious script within the 'Create Featured Result' title field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - For the reflected XSS, the attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted link.
    - For the persistent XSS, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
