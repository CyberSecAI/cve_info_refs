| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

Affected Products  * Cisco ASA Software running on the following products is affected by multiple vulnerabilities:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)Affected releases of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the   specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes"   section of this security advisory for more information about the   affected releases.   Vulnerable Products**Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is   configured in high availability mode (also known   as failover mode) and the *failover ipsec* feature is configured to protect failover communications.      To determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured for failover, use the **show failover** command and verify that the failover is set to *ON* The following   example shows a Cisco ASA with failover mode enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show failover   Failover On   [...]      ``` To determine whether the *failover ipsec* feature is enabled, use the **show running-config failover | include ipsec** command and verify that it returns output.   The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the *failover ipsec* feature enabled:    ```   ciscoasa# show running-config failover | include ipsecfailover ipsec pre-shared-key *****   ```    **Note:** Cisco ASA configurations using the **failover key** command are   not affected by this vulnerability. The *failover ipsec* feature is not enabled by default.      **Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if at least one DNS server IP address is   configured under a DNS server group. This can be configured either as part of the configuration of the default   DNS server group (*DefaultDNS*) or configured under a user-defined DNS server group.       To determine whether a DNS server IP address is configured, use the **show running-config dns server-group** command and verify that the **name-server** parameter includes an IP address.   The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with a DNS server IP *192.168.1.1* as part of the *DefaultDNS* server group.    ```   ciscoasa# show running-config dns server-groupDNS server-group DefaultDNS    name-server 192.168.1.1   ```    **Note:** The DNS **name-server** value is not configured by default in any DNS server group.      **Cisco ASA VPN XML Parser Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is   configured for AnyConnect SSL VPN, Clientless SSL VPN, or AnyConnect   IKEv2 VPN. Cisco ASA Software configured for any other type of VPN is   not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether the system is configured for AnyConnect or Clientless SSL VPN, use the **show running-config webvpn** command and verify   that *webvpn* is enabled on at least one interface. The following example   shows a Cisco ASA with SSL VPN enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn    webvpn    enable outside    [...]      ``` To determine whether the system is configured for AnyConnect IKEv2 VPN, use the **show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable**   command and verify that the **client-services** parameter is present. The following   example shows a Cisco ASA with AnyConnect IKEv2 VPN enabled on the interface *outside*: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable   crypto ikev2 enable outside client-services port 443      ``` **Note:** SSL VPN and AnyConnect IKEv2 VPN features are not enabled by default.   Determining the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a appliance running Cisco ASA Software version 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software   version in the table that is displayed in the login window or in the upper-left   corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA FirePOWER Services and Cisco ASA Context-Aware (CX) Services are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system   used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the   Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, the Cisco ASA Services Module   (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series   Routers, the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, and the Cisco Adaptive   Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv). The Cisco ASA family provides network   security services such as firewall, intrusion   prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.**Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the *failover ipsec* feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an   unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to submit configuration commands to any of the failover units via the failover interface. As a result, an attacker could be   able to take full control of both the active and standby failover units.      The   vulnerability is due to improper handling of secured failover communication messages when the *failover ipsec* feature is configured. An attacker could   exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets directed to the   failover interface IP address. An attacker needs IP connectivity to the failover interface IP addresses to exploit this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only UDP packets directed to the failover interface IP address of the affected system can   be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects   systems configured in routed or transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple   context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6   (IPv6) traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCur21069](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur21069) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0675         **Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the DNS code of the Cisco ASA Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust available memory, which   could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic.      The vulnerability is due   to improper processing of DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a request to an affected Cisco ASA appliance, which can cause it to   generate a DNS request packet. The attacker would need to be able to intercept   this request and reply with a crafted DNS reply packet.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected device can   be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco   ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and   single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuq77655](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq77655) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0676         **Cisco ASA VPN XML Parser Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco ASA Software could allow   an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the WebVPN   component that could lead to the reset of all SSL VPN connections, system   instability, and a reload of the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient hardening of the   XML parser configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a   crafted XML message to the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA appliances   configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN and AnyConnect IKEv2   VPN. All other VPN configurations are unaffected by this vulnerability.      **Note:** Only traffic directed to the affected system can   be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects only   systems configured in routed firewall mode and in single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6   traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCus95290](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus95290) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0677  Workarounds  * For the Cisco ASA Failover Command Injection Vulnerability,   configuring failover protection via the *failover key* feature and removing the *failover ipsec* feature provides a workaround for this issue. To   configure a failover key, use the **failover key**  command. The following example shows how to remove the *failover ipsec* feature and configure the *failover key* feature with a key value *cisco-key*: ```   ciscoasa(config)#no failover ipsec pre-shared-key   ciscoasa(config)#failover key cisco-key   ```   For the Cisco ASA DNS Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability,   reducing the retries setting to 0 under the DNS server-group   provides a workaround for this issue.    The following example shows how to set the retries setting to 0 for the default DNS server-group (*DefaultDNS*) ```   ciscoasa(config-dns-server-group)# DNS server-group DefaultDNS   ciscoasa(config-dns-server-group)# retries 0    ```    There is no workaround for the Cisco ASA VPN XML Parser Denial of Service Vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
