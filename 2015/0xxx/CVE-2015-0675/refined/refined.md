Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0675:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Improper handling of secured failover communication messages when the `failover ipsec` feature is configured on Cisco ASA Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Command injection vulnerability in the failover ipsec feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can submit configuration commands to the failover units, potentially leading to full control of both the active and standby failover units.

**Attack vectors:**

- Sending crafted UDP packets to the failover interface IP address of a vulnerable Cisco ASA appliance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs IP connectivity to the failover interface IP addresses of the affected system.
- The attacker must be adjacent to the network where the vulnerable Cisco ASA device is located.
- No authentication is required for successful exploitation

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects systems configured in high availability mode (failover mode) with the `failover ipsec` feature enabled.
- The `failover ipsec` feature is not enabled by default.
- Systems using the `failover key` command are not affected.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- Affects systems configured in routed or transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode.
- A workaround is available by configuring failover protection using the `failover key` feature and removing the `failover ipsec` feature.
- The vulnerability is documented under Cisco bug ID CSCur21069.
