| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

[TESTCASE1 new cursorjacking vuln.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8553549)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8553549&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150108202552
Steps to reproduce:
When you go on a flash object (with the cursor) that defined the cursor like invisible and a <div> transparent object (transparent obligatory) covers this flash object,
the cursor is now totally invisible.
This flaw can be in used in combination with an image of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to clickjacking during interactions with HTML content subsequently.
I have coded a PoC with the same interaction/severity as the PoC for [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") (the difference between this two bugs is :
in [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") (RESOLVED/FIXED) , the cursor is on the flash object and a some <div> will cover a part of this flash object , and the bug appear when you move the cursor to the <div>.
in this new bug (WORKS ON STABLE/BETA AND OTHERS VERSION OF FIREFOX) , the <div> will directly cover the totality of the flash object .
steps:
1 : Go to the flash object with the cursor (don't click on the flash object)
2 : Wait 2 s
3 : The cursor is totally invisible on all element/ button (on webpage or firefox elements) / addon window or what you want
i will upload a video that demonstrates this vulnerability
Actual results:
This flaw can be in used in combination with an image of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to clickjacking during interactions with HTML content subsequently.
Expected results:
The cursor is totally invisible on all element/ button (on webpage or firefox elements) / addon window or what you want

Here is the detailed history of our behavior with this test case (e10s threw me a bit of a curve ball). I'll follow up with comments specifically about our situation today.
1. Revision 6338a8988917 (2012-06-06): Up until this nightly, this bug was reproducible.
2. Revision 7e4c2abb9fc9 (2012-06-07): Starting with this nightly, the bug was no longer reproducible.
3. Revision 423b9c30c73d (2013-10-17): Last nightly in which the bug was no longer reproducible.
4. Revision 4e7d1e2c93a6 (2013-10-18): Starting with this nightly, the bug started being reproducible again.
5. Revision a75897e664dd: This revision enabled e10s by default and started masking the problem. With e10s, the cursor never disappears. This is still the case until today, and is most likely a bug. However, in non-e10s, this bug is still reproducible.
6. Revision a6db8f54f5aa: With this revision, the cursor starts to be permanently visible in non-e10s as well. Although this is a bug, the immediate security issue reported here is no longer present in either e10s or non-e10s, since the cursor never disappears.
7. Revision b5842b906435 ([bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly")): This revision properly fixed the security issue in non-e10s: The cursor disappears when hovered over the Flash object. Once the div is moved over the Flash object, the cursor reappears. For e10s however, the behavior is unchanged and the cursor remains permanently visible. The immediate security issue reported here continues to no longer apply.

:BenWa, your patch in [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly") had the nice side-effect of fixing this security issue in non-e10s. To quickly summarize: the issue is that the cursor disappears over a Flash object that requests to hide the cursor. Then, a div object is moved on top of the Flash object. The cursor used to not reappear in this case. Your patch properly fixed this for non-e10s by letting the cursor disappear when requested, but once the div was moved over the Flash object, the cursor would reappear. In e10s however, the cursor never disappears in the first place. So, even though the security issue isn't present in e10s, we fail to hide the cursor.
I haven't had the chance to look into this in detail yet, but would you happen to know if your patch might only work in e10s? Do you have any thoughts on making it e10s compatible? Maybe more importantly, do you know if the regression of 60 FPS recomposites is still present in e10s that you intended to fix in [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly")?Flags: needinfo?(bgirard)

I don't see how my patch has anything to do with the cursor. I suspect trying to follow what the difference in NP\_SetWindow sent to the plugin and how the plugin responds to that by hidding/unhidding the plugin. Once you understand that then we can make sure we do the right thing with e10s and not by accident.Flags: needinfo?(bgirard)

As of [bug 1092630](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092630 "RESOLVED FIXED - get rid of native widgets for OS X NPAPI plugins")[1], the security issue reported here is no longer reproducible because the cursor no longer disappears when hovered over the Flash object. [Bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly")[2] later fixed this in that the mouse starts disappearing again when appropriate, but it also reappears when the div is moved over the Flash object, so the security issue reported here remains not reproducible. I've reduced the test case and opened [bug 1130435](/show_bug.cgi?id=1130435 "RESOLVED FIXED - [e10s] Mouse cursor doesn't disappear over Flash object when it should. Works in non-e10s.") to track the remaining e10s issue of the cursor not disappearing when hovered over the Flash object when it should. I'm marking this bug as WFM, but we shouldn't open it until [bug 1092630](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092630 "RESOLVED FIXED - get rid of native widgets for OS X NPAPI plugins") (and ideally [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly")) become part of our release branch and most likely ESR.

Could you clarify what you mean by this? The cursor reappears when it is moved away from the Flash object, or when the div is placed on top of it. Is there something else that we missed that makes this still exploitable?

Yes, this isn't fixed on each version of Firefox, which is why this bug remains closed until the patches were able to make it to stable and ESR. Daniel, do you suggest that we handle this differently?Flags: needinfo?(spohl.mozilla.bugs) → needinfo?(dveditz)

If we know which patch made the problem go away then "FIXED" is a better resolution than WORKSFORME. When we resolve a severe security bug it's important to track which versions are still affected. I've set the status-firefox flags based on my interpretation of your [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1125013#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox for Mac OS X : Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div"), please correct them if they're wrong.
But did [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly") really fix the problem? Looks like the fix there was a backout of [bug 1092630](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092630 "RESOLVED FIXED - get rid of native widgets for OS X NPAPI plugins"), but that one didn't land until Firefox 37. Seems hard to blame that one for this bug which Jordi reported against Firefox 35. Given we haven't found "a" fix we can backport to release builds it's probably better to leave this one open and just mark status-firefox38 as fixed.

in this testcase,the flashobject is completly covers by a div object( the flash object normaly defined the cursor like invisible) and when the cursor is invisible on the flash object and a div covers this object , the cursor is invisible and the invisibility is persistant (this demonstration is possible in firefox stable version 35.0.1).
In nightly it isn't the case because there is a bug in all flash object which defines the cursor as invisible , all flash object which should render the cursor invisible don' allow this possibility due to a bug inthe nightly version, when the bug in the nightly version will be fixed (allowing to renders invisible the cursor in all flash object which have this particularity) this bug will work on nighlty version.Flags: needinfo?(jordi.chancel)

I think you're referring to the difference between e10s vs. non-e10s windows. However, although the cursor is permanently visible in e10s (tracked by [bug 1130435](/show_bug.cgi?id=1130435 "RESOLVED FIXED - [e10s] Mouse cursor doesn't disappear over Flash object when it should. Works in non-e10s.")), the underlying security issue appears to be fixed by revision b5842b906435, i.e. [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly") (see point 7 in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1125013#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mozilla Firefox for Mac OS X : Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")).
Could you try to reproduce the issue in a current nightly with e10s disabled? Here are the steps:
1. Open browser to about:config
2. Set browser.tabs.remote.autostart.1 to false.
3. Restart the browser.
4. Run your test case.
Does the issue reproduce?Flags: needinfo?(jordi.chancel)

Yes, that's due to [bug 1130435](/show_bug.cgi?id=1130435 "RESOLVED FIXED - [e10s] Mouse cursor doesn't disappear over Flash object when it should. Works in non-e10s.").

after all steps you have needed me : the cursor disappears on the flash object when it is over it and appears when div cover it (when on about config the browser.tabs.remote.autostart.1 is false) (so this vulnerability doesn't work on last firefox nightly version but it works perfectly on firefox 35.0.1 stable version last update.Flags: needinfo?(spohl.mozilla.bugs)

Thanks, Jordi! I've also gone ahead and confirmed that this issue is fixed in Firefox 37.0a2 (2015-02-23). This was to be expected, since [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly") also landed there. The issue continues to be reproducible in Firefox 35 and Firefox 36.

this vulnerability as exactly the same impact the same interaction needed and the same severity / attack possibilitiy than [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") which is sec-high...
if you don't remake the security rating of this severity and refuse to sendme an award defined by a sec-high security rating for this nsec-high vulnerability, i will disclose it because i can works for the security of firefox but if i found a vulnerability unpatched on the firefrox 36.0 which is unpatched and it my works isn't rewarded i will disclose it on all site specialized to vulnerability disclosing and saying than you don't want be honest and put the real severity rating (i repeat it is exaxtly the same as [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")) and reward me for my work...
Now take your choose but i don't want wait eternaly and it is just a question of day if you dont want accept the reality (the reality is that the security rating is the same as [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")). it is mwobensmith@mozilla.com which as defined the security rating of [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") as sec-high , (which is the reality) so if you are able to defne the security rating of this vulnerability , pleas ask at mwobensmith@mozilla.com. it is realy decouraging than you delete this security rating which is the real severity of this vulneravility . choose quickly or accept the disclosing of a vulnerability exactly similare to [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")(same impact/same interaction/ same attack possibility etc etc etc).Flags: needinfo?(mwobensmith)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Jordi,
Please quit setting the security rating yourself. You aren't to do that on your own bugs. We've asked you for two years or more to not set security ratings on your own bugs. Let the developers set the rating as they work to fix it.
Please, when one of us removes a keyword or a flag, don't just put it back.
I was in a meeting with Matt earlier today and we discussed this bug. It was \*after\* that discussion that we agreed that I would remove the rating and we both recalled that we ask external bounty seekers who open bugs to not set their own ratings. If you thought this was a sec-high, you should have needinfo? an appropriate person within our security org, made your case, and asked them to assign a security rating.
Also, if you continue to threaten us with a public disclosure simply because you don't like a security rating or how we manage bugs in bugzilla, we will no longer be able to let you participate in the bug bounty program. We take threats seriously. I know your annoyed but please don't threaten us again.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

Okay no probelmse if in trhis discussion it's is evoked that thgis vulnerability have the same user interaction an attack possibility than [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div")
this bug and [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") are identic at all
So if the security rathing isn't sg-high like [bug995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div") which is exactly the same vulnerbaility , it is not normal and i would thatyou say that in the next discussion.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

I'm really sorry and I ask you to accept my apologies for my wrong conduct but sometimes I'm very sorry/sad about the disagreements about the severity of the vulnerabilities that i found to you because I work essentially for that the security of firefox has always a better safe without being inevitably remunerate... Now i will never touch again at the security rating even if it is changed or deleted. sorry again about my really wrong conduct. i appreciate realy all workers of firefox and I really feel guilty for my behavior.

The severity of this bug falls in the wide mushy middle. Technically it's spoofing which is normally sec-low. Your examples eventually do sec-high things like turn on the camera or sec-critical things like installing random add-ons -- however it doesn't do those things silently with a drive-by. It requires some serious interaction with the user and the attack is not "silent" because ultimately the permission prompts/dialogs do pop on top where the user can see what happened. In the most critical case of the addon installs the attack assumes you've hacked addons.mozilla.org or convinced the user to change the pref allowing all sites to do installs. Even if the prompts popping up don't cause the user to abandon ship before getting hacked (perhaps it pops up within the user's reaction time) it's still going to cause the attack to get reported and prevent the potential for widespread damage that the sec-high and sec-critical severities represent. Even simple phishing sites with incorrect URLs fool some of the people some of the time.
You are correct that this bug has an identical impact to [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div"). The bug that is rated incorrectly was [bug 995603](/show_bug.cgi?id=995603 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cursor can be totally invisible using flash object and div"), artificially pushed to the high side so we could award a bounty in appreciation of your work and the novelty of the attack.

D'accord j'accepte la note de sécurité , but if i do a mix with another bug (unpatched) rated as "sec-moderate" also, to program a better testcase which use these two vulnerability, the testcase programed which will render an attack more "silently" for "webcam spying", is it possible to change the security rating?

This vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 37
( <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-35/> ).
Can you make the resolution of this bug like RESOLVED/FIXED or VERIFIED/FIXED please ? ( It is important for me )
Thank you.

I'm not sure exactly how to best close this, as it was technically fixed by [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly"). However, [bug 1121811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Power] Flash on mac is triggering 60 FPS recomposites on Nightly") wasn't dealing with the security issue reported here, so duplicating seems inappropriate. I'll let others make the call.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-35

## Cursor clickjacking with flash and images

Announced
March 31, 2015
Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 37
* SeaMonkey 2.35

### Description

Security researcher **Jordi Chancel** reported a mechanism that
made cursor invisible through flash content and then replaced it through the
layering of HTML content. This flaw can be in used in combination with an image
of the cursor manipulated through JavaScript, leading to clickjacking during
subsequent interactions with HTML content.

This flaw only affects OS X systems. Windows and Linux
installations are unaffected.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
