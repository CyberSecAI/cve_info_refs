Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the interaction between Flash objects and HTML elements, specifically `<div>` elements, on macOS. A Flash object can be set to render the cursor invisible. When a transparent `<div>` element is placed over this Flash object, the cursor remains invisible even when moved away from the Flash object, or over other elements. This creates an opportunity for clickjacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cursor Manipulation:** The core issue is the ability of a Flash object to manipulate the cursor's visibility, coupled with a failure to correctly restore cursor visibility when a `<div>` element overlays the Flash object.
*   **Clickjacking:** This invisible cursor can be exploited in a clickjacking attack. The attacker can present a false visual interface with the manipulated cursor, causing users to unintentionally click on hidden elements, potentially leading to malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Clickjacking:** The primary impact is clickjacking, where an attacker can trick users into performing actions they did not intend. This could include:
    *   Unintended clicks on links or buttons.
    *   Granting unintended permissions (e.g., camera access).
    *   Installation of malicious add-ons if the user has enabled this option.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Page:** The attack is carried out through a malicious web page containing a Flash object that hides the cursor and a transparent `<div>` element that overlays the Flash object.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to hover their mouse cursor over the Flash object. After that, the cursor becomes invisible and any subsequent clicks on the page can be hijacked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve web pages to the victim, which could be through a malicious website or injected content on a legitimate website.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Browser:** The attacker must know that the victim is using a vulnerable version of Firefox on macOS.
*   **JavaScript knowledge:** It would help an attacker to have JavaScript skills to manipulate the cursor's position via an image.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reproducible up to a certain Firefox nightly build, then fixed in a subsequent build but reintroduced later.
*   The initial fix was not directly related to the security issue but was a side effect of a patch for a power management issue ([bug 1121811](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1121811)). This fix made the cursor reappear when the div was moved over the flash object, mitigating the issue.
*   The issue is specific to macOS; Windows and Linux systems are unaffected.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported against Firefox 35 and fixed in Firefox 37.
*   There was disagreement about the severity rating of the vulnerability, with the reporter initially arguing for "sec-high" based on its similarity to a previously rewarded "sec-high" bug ([bug 995603](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=995603)). It was later classified as "sec-moderate," with the explanation that while the vulnerability can be used for clickjacking with bad consequences, it requires interaction with the user and isn't as silent as other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is closely related to [bug 995603](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=995603), where the cursor also becomes invisible using a flash object and div elements.
*   [Bug 1121833](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1121833) is marked as a duplicate of this CVE, suggesting a related vulnerability involving a flash object and the JavaScript `alert()` function.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was applied in Firefox 37 and later versions.

In summary, CVE-2015-0810 is a clickjacking vulnerability in Firefox on macOS due to improper handling of cursor visibility when a `<div>` element overlays a Flash object. It was resolved with a patch that was not originally intended to fix this security issue.
