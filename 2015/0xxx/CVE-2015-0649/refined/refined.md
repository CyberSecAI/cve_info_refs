Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-0649:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of malformed TCP packets directed at a CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of malformed TCP packets.
- Lack of proper input validation for CIP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.
- This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, interrupting services on the device.
- Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted IPv4 packets to TCP port 44818 on a device with CIP enabled.
- The attacker needs to successfully establish a TCP three-way handshake.
- UDP packets, IPv6 packets and packets transiting the device cannot be used to trigger this specific vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker.
- Ability to send IPv4 packets.
- Must target devices where CIP is enabled.
- Must be able to establish a TCP 3 way handshake.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS Software.
- It is triggered when processing crafted CIP packets over TCP.
- The Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) is an industrial protocol for industrial automation applications using TCP/UDP port 44818 for explicit messaging.
- By default, CIP is not enabled in Cisco IOS Software. Users can verify the presence of the `cip enable` command in their `show running-config` to see if it is enabled.
- The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCun63514.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
