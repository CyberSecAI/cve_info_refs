Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Shell command injection vulnerability exists in the `tardiff` tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `tardiff` tool is susceptible to shell command injection. This occurs due to the tool's failure to properly sanitize shell meta-characters in filenames within tar archives or in the tar filename itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands by crafting malicious tar files with shell meta-characters in filenames. This can lead to various malicious activities including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, data modification, or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into processing a specially crafted malicious tar archive with `tardiff`. This can happen either by providing a tar file as an argument to `tardiff` or if `tardiff` processes tar files internally with names supplied by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or control a tar archive and make the victim use the tardiff utility on it.
- The attacker needs to have the crafted malicious tar archive be processed by a user running `tardiff`.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content does not specify if a specific user needs to execute the command or what kind of access the user who executes the command has, that would determine the extent of the impact.
- The advisory highlights that the vulnerability was fixed in `tardiff` version `0.1-2+deb8u2` for the stable distribution (jessie) and in version `0.1-5` (and partially earlier versions) for the unstable distribution (sid).
