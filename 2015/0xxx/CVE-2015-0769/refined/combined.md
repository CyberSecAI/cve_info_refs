| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 5.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 4.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 4.1 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsA Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is affected by this vulnerability when all the following conditions are met:      1) Any of the following line cards are installed on the chassis:   + CRS-MSC-140G: Cisco CRS-3 Modular Services Card (140G)   + CRS-FP140: Cisco CRS-3 Forwarding Processor Card (140 Gbps)   + CRS-LSP: Cisco CRS-3 Label Switch Processor2) The Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is running a Cisco IOS XR release affected by this vulnerability. See the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory for information about affected releases. **Note:** Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 4.2.1 and later are not affected by this vulnerability. 3) Any previously listed line card is configured to process IPv6 traffic. Administrators can use the **show diag** command to determine whether any of the affected line cards are installed on a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device. The following output shows a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device with a CRS-MSC-140G line card installed:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh diag   Thu Jun  4 14:53:25.229 EDT      CARD 0/0/* : Cisco CRS Series Modular Services Card 140G     MAIN:  board type 500064            800-32942-06 rev B0            dev N/A            S/N SAX99999ZZZ     PCA:   73-12720-06 rev A0     PID:   CRS-MSC-140G     VID:   V03     CLEI:  IPUCAZYBAC     ECI:   180032          ```    Administrators can use the **show version** command to determine the Cisco IOS XR release running on the device. A device running Cisco IOS XR will include the string "Cisco IOS XR" in the output of the **show version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IOS XR Release 4.1.2: ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh version    Thu Jun  4 14:56:06.484 EDT      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 4.1.2[Default]   Copyright (c) 2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.      ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.05(20110622:151317) [CRS ROMMON],        router uptime is 2 years, 11 weeks, 5 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes      System image file is "disk0:hfr-os-mbi-4.1.2.CSCtw71819-1.0.0/0x100008/mbihfr-rp-x86e.vm"      cisco CRS-16/S (Intel 686 F6M14S4) processor with 12582912K bytes of memory.   Intel 686 F6M14S4 processor at 2130Mhz, Revision 2.174      Cisco CRS Series 16 Slots Line Card Chassis       ```    Administrators can use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief          GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up]   fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150   202::1       ```    The **show ipv6 interface brief** command will produce an   error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not   support IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if   IPv6 is disabled.       An interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may *not* appear on the output of the **show ipv6 interface brief** command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh ipv6 vrf all interface    Thu Jun  4 15:12:11.170 EDT      Bundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001)     IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd     Global unicast address(es):       2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64      Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2         ff02::1     MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6)     ICMP redirects are disabled     ICMP unreachables are enabled     ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1     ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds     ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds     Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.     Outgoing access list is not set     Inbound  access list is not set     Table Id is 0xe0800001         ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco 12000 Series Routers, Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services   Routers, Cisco Carrier Routing System 1 (CRS-1), Cisco CRS-X Carrier Routing System, and Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 Series Routers running Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by this   vulnerability. Only Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System devices that meet all the conditions in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory are affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the IP version 6 (IPv6) processing code of Cisco IOS XR Software for   Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to trigger an ASIC scan of the Network Processor Unit (NPU) and a reload of the   line   card processing an IPv6 packet.      The vulnerability is due   to incorrect processing of an IPv6 packet carrying IPv6 extension   headers that are valid but unlikely to be seen during normal operation. An attacker   could exploit   this vulnerability by sending such an IPv6 packet to an   affected device that is configured to process IPv6 traffic. An exploit   could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the line card, resulting   in a DoS condition.      A Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device that meets all the conditions listed in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory is affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv6 transit traffic or IPv6 traffic destined to the device itself.      This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.         This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx03546](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx03546) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0769.  Workarounds  * There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       The following Cisco IOS XR releases are affected by this vulnerability:    + Cisco IOS XR Releases 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 4.0.3 and 4.0.4   + Cisco IOS XR Releases 4.1.0, 4.1.1 and 4.1.2   + Cisco IOS XR Release 4.2.0 This vulnerability has been corrected in the following Software Maintenance Updates (SMUs):    + **hfr-px-4.1.0.CSCtx03546.pie** for release 4.1.0   + **hfr-px-4.1.1.CSCtx03546.pie** for release 4.1.1   + **hfr-px-4.1.2.CSCtx03546.pie** for release 4.1.2   + **hfr-px-4.2.0.CSCtx03546.pie** for release 4.2.0 Please consult the README file associated with each SMU for additional information.  Customers running Cisco IOS XR Releases 4.0.1, 4.0.2, 4.0.3, or 4.0.4 should upgrade to a currently supported release.      Cisco IOS XR Release 4.2.1 and later already include a fix for this vulnerability. No upgrade or SMU installation will be required.

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsA Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is affected by this vulnerability when all the following conditions are met:      1) Any of the following line cards are installed on the chassis:   + CRS-MSC-140G: Cisco CRS-3 Modular Services Card (140G)   + CRS-FP140: Cisco CRS-3 Forwarding Processor Card (140 Gbps)   + CRS-LSP: Cisco CRS-3 Label Switch Processor2) The Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is running a Cisco IOS XR release affected by this vulnerability. See the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory for information about affected releases. **Note:** Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 4.2.1 and later are not affected by this vulnerability. 3) Any previously listed line card is configured to process IPv6 traffic. Administrators can use the **show diag** command to determine whether any of the affected line cards are installed on a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device. The following output shows a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device with a CRS-MSC-140G line card installed:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh diag   Thu Jun  4 14:53:25.229 EDT      CARD 0/0/* : Cisco CRS Series Modular Services Card 140G     MAIN:  board type 500064            800-32942-06 rev B0            dev N/A            S/N SAX99999ZZZ     PCA:   73-12720-06 rev A0     PID:   CRS-MSC-140G     VID:   V03     CLEI:  IPUCAZYBAC     ECI:   180032          ```    Administrators can use the **show version** command to determine the Cisco IOS XR release running on the device. A device running Cisco IOS XR will include the string "Cisco IOS XR" in the output of the **show version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IOS XR Release 4.1.2: ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh version    Thu Jun  4 14:56:06.484 EDT      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 4.1.2[Default]   Copyright (c) 2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.      ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.05(20110622:151317) [CRS ROMMON],        router uptime is 2 years, 11 weeks, 5 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes      System image file is "disk0:hfr-os-mbi-4.1.2.CSCtw71819-1.0.0/0x100008/mbihfr-rp-x86e.vm"      cisco CRS-16/S (Intel 686 F6M14S4) processor with 12582912K bytes of memory.   Intel 686 F6M14S4 processor at 2130Mhz, Revision 2.174      Cisco CRS Series 16 Slots Line Card Chassis       ```    Administrators can use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief          GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up]   fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150   202::1       ```    The **show ipv6 interface brief** command will produce an   error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not   support IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if   IPv6 is disabled.       An interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may *not* appear on the output of the **show ipv6 interface brief** command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh ipv6 vrf all interface    Thu Jun  4 15:12:11.170 EDT      Bundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001)     IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd     Global unicast address(es):       2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64      Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2         ff02::1     MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6)     ICMP redirects are disabled     ICMP unreachables are enabled     ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1     ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds     ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds     Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.     Outgoing access list is not set     Inbound  access list is not set     Table Id is 0xe0800001         ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco 12000 Series Routers, Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services   Routers, Cisco Carrier Routing System 1 (CRS-1), Cisco CRS-X Carrier Routing System, and Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 Series Routers running Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by this   vulnerability. Only Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System devices that meet all the conditions in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory are affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the IP version 6 (IPv6) processing code of Cisco IOS XR Software for   Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to trigger an ASIC scan of the Network Processor Unit (NPU) and a reload of the   line   card processing an IPv6 packet.      The vulnerability is due   to incorrect processing of an IPv6 packet carrying IPv6 extension   headers that are valid but unlikely to be seen during normal operation. An attacker   could exploit   this vulnerability by sending such an IPv6 packet to an   affected device that is configured to process IPv6 traffic. An exploit   could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the line card, resulting   in a DoS condition.      A Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device that meets all the conditions listed in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this advisory is affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv6 transit traffic or IPv6 traffic destined to the device itself.      This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.         This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx03546](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx03546) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0769.
