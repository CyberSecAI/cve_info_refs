    "summary": "The provided content details a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS where TLS connections to TURN and STUN servers would silently fall back to unencrypted TCP connections if the TLS connection failed. This could expose credentials through a Man-in-the-Middle attack.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The WebRTC implementation accepted `turns:` and `stuns:` URIs but did not enforce TLS, falling back to plaintext TCP connections.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Accepting `turns:` and `stuns:` URIs without enforcing TLS.",
        "Failing to reject connections when TLS handshake fails, resorting to insecure TCP connections.",
        "Exposure of credentials due to the use of unencrypted communication."
      ],
      "impact": "Disclosure of credentials due to unencrypted transmission, potentially leading to unauthorized access of TURN/STUN services. A man-in-the-middle attack can occur when the plaintext connection is intercepted.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting the plaintext connection.",
          "A malicious TURN/STUN server may be set up to receive credentials when the client falls back to TCP."
