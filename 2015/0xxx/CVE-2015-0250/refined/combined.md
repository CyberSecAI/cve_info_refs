# RHSA-2016:0041 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.5 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.5, which fixes one security issue, several bugs,
and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business-rules management system for the
management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss Rules.

This release of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.5 serves as a replacement for Red
Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements that are
documented in the README.txt file included with the patch files.

The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

It was found that batik was vulnerable to XML External Entity attacks when
parsing SVG files. A remote attacker able to send malicious SVG content to
the affected server could use this flaw to read files accessible to the
user running the application server, and potentially perform other more
advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2015-0250)

All users of Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.5.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing installation, including all applications, configuration files,
databases and database settings, and so forth.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application
Server process before installing this update; after installing the
update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server
process.

Package        : batik
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0250
Debian Bug     : 780897

Nicolas Gregoire and Kevin Schaller discovered that Batik, a toolkit
for processing SVG images, would load XML external entities by
default. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could possibly obtain access
to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7+dfsg-3+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.7+dfsg-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your batik packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-03-19 15:52:24 UTC  ``` The following flaw was found in Apache Batik:  Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive files--would be possible.  XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.  Additional information:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/864>  External References:  <http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2015-08-18 08:38:47 UTC  ``` This issue was also fixed in upstream versions 1.7.1 and 1.6.1.  Upstream commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1664335>  Further details from one of the reporters acknowledged in the upstream advisory:  <https://www.insinuator.net/2015/03/xxe-injection-in-apache-batik-library-cve-2015-0250/> <https://www.ernw.de/download/apache_batik_xxe_advisory.txt>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2015-08-18 10:46:34 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report from 2012 from the other reporter acknowledged in the upstream advisory:  <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53603> <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BATIK-1018> <https://twitter.com/agarri_fr/status/578132631180673024>  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BATIK-1113>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2015-09-01 03:24:10 UTC  ``` For JBoss Fuse, Apache Batik is used by the camel-fop component to render messages into SVG Image+XML. See:     <https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=camel.git;a=blob;f=components/camel-fop/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/fop/FopProducer.java;h=d41b6d187cb7b5faf48fa3244c0b7d77ed204779;hb=e18459e53cf77514bb0fdfeceb423c456bbc4d9d>  The vulnerability fixed an issue with the way SVG parses XML, not with the way it produces it. Therefore the issue doesn't effect JBoss Fuse 6.2.0. Add jboss/fuse=notaffected   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2015-09-01 04:02:05 UTC  ``` For JBoss FSW, Apache Batik is used by BPEL Console, see:     system/layers/soa/org/switchyard/component/bpel/main/module.xml          <!-- Required by bpel2svg module -->         <module name="org.apache.xmlgraphics" />  If we check the source code for BPEL (downstream Riftsaw) we see it doesn't use the patched SAXDocumentFactory, it used DOMUtils to write an XML Document:     <https://github.com/riftsaw/riftsaw/blob/master/console/bpel2svg/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/bpel/ui/bpel2svg/impl/SVGImpl.java>  Similar to JBoss Fuse, the SVG functionality is there for rendering XML, not for parsing it. Updating fsw-6/batik to notaffected.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-07 20:47:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.2.0  Via RHSA-2015:2560 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2560.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-12-07 20:49:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.2.0  Via RHSA-2015:2559 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2559.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-01-14 18:35:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:  Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.5  Via RHSA-2016:0042 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0042.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1203762#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-01-14 18:36:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:  Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.5  Via RHSA-2016:0041 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0041.html>   ``` |  |

# [CVE-2015-0250] Apache Batik Information Disclosure Vulnerability (XXE Injection)

---

*From*: Kevin Schaller <kschaller () ernw de>

*Date*: Sat, 21 Mar 2015 00:54:12 +0100

```
XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Vulnerability in Apache Batik (Java
SVG Toolkit)
====================================================================================
Researcher: Kevin Schaller <kschaller () ernw de>

Description
===========
Batik is a Java-based toolkit for applications or applets that want to
use images in the
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for various purposes, such as
display, generation or
manipulation. [1]

Batik offers several classes for svg to png/jpg conversion, which suffer
from a XML External
Entity Injection due to the evaluation of external entities within the
given svg file. If an
application offers the possibility to upload a svg file an attacker can
put in a malicious formed
file and retrieve sensitive information such as the content of files of
the respective server.
The type of file that can be retrieved depends on the user context in
which the application is running.

Further information about the vulnerability can be seen here [2] and
here [3].

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

CVSS Base Score
===============
6.4 (AV:N / AC:L / Au:N / C:P / I:N / A:P)

CVE-ID
======
CVE-2015-0250

Impact
======
Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can
be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed svg
files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context
in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is 'root'
a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive
files--would be possible.

XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server
via denial of service as the references within a xml document
can trivially trigger an amplification attack.

Proof of Concept
================
A fully documented proof of concept can be downloaded here: [4]

Mitigation
==========
Upgrade to Batik 1.8+

Affected Versions
=================
All versions
1.0 - 1.7 (current)

Timeline
========
2015-01-22: Apache informed via email - no response
2015-02-08: Remainder sent via email
2015-02-10: Vulnerability confirmed and fix has been tested and
confirmed to work
2015-03-17: Release of a fixed version and public dislocure

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Updated batik packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 09 Apr 2015

Modification date: 09 Apr 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2015-0250](CVE-2015-0250.html)

## Description

```
Updated batik packages fix security vulnerability:

Nicolas Gregoire and Kevin Schaller discovered that Batik would load XML
external entities by default. If a user or automated system were tricked into
opening a specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could possibly obtain access
to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption (CVE-2015-0250).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
