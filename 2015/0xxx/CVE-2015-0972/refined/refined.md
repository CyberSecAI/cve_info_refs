Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Pearson ProctorCache software uses a hard-coded, non-unique administrative password. This means the same password is used across all installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a static, hard-coded password for administrative functions.
*   **Lack of Unique Passwords:** The password is not unique per installation, making all installations vulnerable if the password is discovered.
*   **Unchangeable Password:** The administrative password cannot be changed by the users, leaving them with no recourse to protect themselves.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Test Session Disruption:** An attacker can interrupt test sessions.
*   **Administrative Actions:** An attacker can perform administrative tasks, including canceling tests and deleting users.
*   **Potential Data Access:** Although the test data is encrypted, administrative access could potentially lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network:** The primary attack vector is an attacker on the same local network as the ProctorCache server.
*   **Credential Abuse:** The attacker uses the hard-coded administrative password to gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the ProctorCache server.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the hard-coded administrative password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password.**
*   Pearson released a patch in version 2015.1.17 to allow for password changes.
*   The CVSS score reflects a significant risk, especially within the context of local network compromise (Base score 6.2, Temporal score 5.1).
