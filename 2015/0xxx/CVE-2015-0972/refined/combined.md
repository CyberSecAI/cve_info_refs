## Pearson ProctorCache contains hard coded credentials

#### Vulnerability Note VU#626420

Original Release Date: 2015-06-16 | Last Revised: 2015-06-16

---

### Overview

The Pearson ProctorCache software uses a hard coded password for administrative tasks.

### Description

| The ProctorCache is designed to cache the testing content, as well as cache the responses and maintain a client list of active test-takers. ProctorCache is a server software package installed locally within the LAN on a Windows system.  [**CWE-259**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Password -** CVE-2015-0972ProctorCache prior to version 2015.1.17 requires authentication to perform administrative tasks. However, the authentication consists of a hard-coded administrative password, which is not unique per installation, and cannot be changed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker on the local network can use the credentials to interrupt a test session and perform administrative tasks such as canceling tests or deleting users. According to Pearson, the actual test data is encrypted and not immediately accessible by an administrator. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Pearson has released ProctorCache version 2015.1.17 to address this issue by allowing the password to be changed. Affected users will be notified directly by Pearson of the update, and should update their software to version 2015.1.17 or later as soon as possible. The location of the upgrade as well as instructions for changing the ProctorCache password will be provided for download in the notification to existing customers. |
