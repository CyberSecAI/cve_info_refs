  "CVE-2015-0293": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2015-0293",
      "Description": "The SSLv2 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (s2_lib.c assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message."
    },
    "Content": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly check for certain characteristics in a client's `CLIENT-MASTER-KEY` message when handling SSLv2, which leads to an assertion failure in the `s2_lib.c` component, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of SSLv2 `CLIENT-MASTER-KEY` messages",
        "Missing input validation on SSLv2 handshake messages",
        "Assertion failure leading to denial of service"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can trigger an `OPENSSL_assert` which leads to a denial of service by causing a server using OpenSSL to exit.  This occurs when the server supports both SSLv2 and export ciphers.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted SSLv2 `CLIENT-MASTER-KEY` message.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable server, and the server must have both SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites enabled."
