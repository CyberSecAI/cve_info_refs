      "content": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Adobe Flash Player, the worst of which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n\nA remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, obtain sensitive information or bypass security restrictions.\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF content.\n\nThese security issues were fixed:\n- Heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to code execution (CVE-2015-0323, CVE-2015-0327).\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the Adobe Flash libraries contained within Internet Explorer.\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer for the desktop, an attacker could host a website that is designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit any of these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario where the user is using Internet Explorer in the Windows 8-style UI, an attacker would first need to compromise a website already listed in the Compatibility View (CV) list. An attacker could then host a website that contains specially crafted Flash content designed to exploit any of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website.",
