Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data using PHP's `unserialize` function in Bomgar Remote Support. The application does not sufficiently validate the data before deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation before deserializing data provided by users. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized PHP objects.
*   **Code Injection:** By crafting a malicious PHP object, an attacker can write arbitrary data to arbitrary files, effectively leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code within the context of the Bomgar Remote Support system user.
*   **System Compromise:**  This could lead to a full compromise of the affected system depending on the privileges of the PHP process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious input via a POST request to the `/session_complete` endpoint. The `lsid` parameter is used in the exploit, which can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user after submitting a new issue via the 'Issue Submission' form.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** Authenticated users can also exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious input to other vulnerable PHP files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Bomgar Remote Support portal.
*   **Knowledge of LSID:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid Logging Session ID (LSID), which can be obtained from the 'Issue Submission' form.
*   **Crafting Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious, serialized PHP object.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit is available as a Metasploit module, further detailing the attack process.
*   The vulnerability is present in Bomgar Remote Support versions prior to 15.1.1.
*   The exploit involves writing a PHP stager to a temporary file, then using another crafted serialized object to execute the stager.
*   A patch and upgrade to version 15.1.1 is available.
