The provided content includes information about **CVE-2015-0094**, along with other CVEs (CVE-2015-0077, CVE-2015-0078 and CVE-2015-0095).

Here's the information related to **CVE-2015-0094**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel-mode driver leaking private address information during a function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability: The driver leaks kernel memory contents, specifically private address information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain information about the system's memory layout, which could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. It can be used to bypass security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- By itself, this vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system to run the malicious application.

**Additional notes:**
- The update addresses this vulnerability by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers at the time the security bulletin was issued.
