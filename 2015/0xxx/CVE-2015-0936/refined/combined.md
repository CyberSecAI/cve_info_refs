## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 SSH Private Key Exposure (CVE-2015-0936)

# Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 SSH Private Key Exposure (CVE-2015-0936)

## Product Description

Ceragon produces a series of ruggedized, microwave backhaul devices used
to provide connectivity to mobile, IP-based devices; usually, these
devices are found in either large industrial environments, or installed
on towers to provide "middle-mile" connectivity to mobile customers on
behalf of ISPs. In other words, a FibeAir IP-10 typically act as a router
of IP traffic. A compromise on these devices can expose the
communications of all subscribed devices.

## Vulnerability Summary

Several versions of Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 devices have been identified
as having a static, pre-generated public/private keypair associated with
the "mateidu" user available both locally on these devices, and as part
of update packages. This issue is similar to the previously-reported
default root password, reported by Jasper Greve and identified as
[CVE-2015-0924][1]. This vulnerability was [discovered independently][2]
by HD Moore of Rapid7, Inc., while validating CVE-2015-0924.

## Details

There are two important distinctions from CVE-2015-0924. First, the
mateidu user does not, by default, have root-level access permissions on
the device. In order to obtain root access, an attacker would need to
also exercise a local vulnerability.

Second, even if the user was able to easily replace the mateidu
authorized_keys file, later firmware upgrades replace any existing
authorized_keys file with the standard issue key. Distributions of these
update packages containing the corresponding private key are easily
obtained by using simple search terms on any major search engine.

A Metasploit module has been produced and published to demonstrate the
vulnerability, and is made publicly available so device owners and
maintainers may effectively and easily test any mitigation and patching
solution provided or invented.

### Exposed Key Pair

The shipping public key for the mateidu user has the fingerprint,
`27:c6:ad:f9:a6:4d:22:3f:18:b0:3b:df:81:1c:57:45` , and is:

```
ssh-rsa

## Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridge contains a default root password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#936356

Original Release Date: 2015-01-16 | Last Revised: 2015-01-21

---

### Overview

Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridge contains a default root password.

### Description

| [**CWE-255**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html)**:****Credentials Management**  Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridges contain a default root password. The root account can be accessed through ssh, telnet, command line interface, or via HTTP.The affected vendor, Ceragon, has provided the following statement:*The FibeAir IP-10 products have an embedded Linux OS.* *The root password that is within the IP-10 products is a default password and can be changed by our customers in a simple manner. The existence of such a password is documented in the product user documentation, is highlighted to the customer post shipment, and it is recommended to be changed in accordance with common password management policies.**Many of our customers have chosen to change the root password and that is based on information provided within the product documentation referring to capability and ways of changing all Admin privileges, as well as access to the Linux OS Shell.**We would like to remind again, those customers who have not changed the default root password on their installed IP-10 devices are encouraged to contact your local Ceragon representative, who will assign a customer service expert to provide a means for quick and secure update of root password in multiple devices, simultaneously.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain administrative privileges on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Change your Password**Change any default passwords, and do not deploy without changing default passwords. Search engines such as Shodan can index systems exposed to the internet and default passwords are usually documented and well-known. It is often trivial for an attacker to identify and access systems on the internet using default passwords. |

Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 SSH Private Key Exposure (CVE-2015-0936)

# Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 SSH Private Key Exposure (CVE-2015-0936)

## Product Description

Ceragon produces a series of ruggedized, microwave backhaul devices used
to provide connectivity to mobile, IP-based devices; usually, these
devices are found in either large industrial environments, or installed
on towers to provide "middle-mile" connectivity to mobile customers on
behalf of ISPs. In other words, a FibeAir IP-10 typically act as a router
of IP traffic. A compromise on these devices can expose the
communications of all subscribed devices.

## Vulnerability Summary

Several versions of Ceragon FibeAir IP-10 devices have been identified
as having a static, pre-generated public/private keypair associated with
the "mateidu" user available both locally on these devices, and as part
of update packages. This issue is similar to the previously-reported
default root password, reported by Jasper Greve and identified as
[CVE-2015-0924](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/936356). This vulnerability was [discovered independently](https://hdm.io/blog/2015/01/20/partial-disclosure-is-annoying/)
by HD Moore of Rapid7, Inc., while validating CVE-2015-0924.

## Details

There are two important distinctions from CVE-2015-0924. First, the
mateidu user does not, by default, have root-level access permissions on
the device. In order to obtain root access, an attacker would need to
also exercise a local vulnerability.

Second, even if the user was able to easily replace the mateidu
authorized\_keys file, later firmware upgrades replace any existing
authorized\_keys file with the standard issue key. Distributions of these
update packages containing the corresponding private key are easily
obtained by using simple search terms on any major search engine.

A Metasploit module has been produced and published to demonstrate the
vulnerability, and is made publicly available so device owners and
maintainers may effectively and easily test any mitigation and patching
solution provided or invented.

### Exposed Key Pair

The shipping public key for the mateidu user has the fingerprint,
`27:c6:ad:f9:a6:4d:22:3f:18:b0:3b:df:81:1c:57:45` , and is:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwRIdDlHaIqZXND/l1vFT7ue3rc/DvXh2yx5EFtuxGQRHVxGMazDhV4vj5ANGXDQwUYI0iZh6aOVrDy8I/y9/y+YDGCvsnqrDbuPDjW26s2bBXWgUPiC93T3TA6L2KOxhVcl7mljEOIYACRHPpJNYVGhinCxDUH9LxMrdNXgP5Ok= mateidu@localhost

```

The private key is:
