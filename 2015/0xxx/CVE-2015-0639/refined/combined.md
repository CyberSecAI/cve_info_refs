Affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing fragmented IP version 4 (IPv4) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) and high-speed logging (HSL). Additionally, application layer gateway (ALG) or zone-based policy firewall inspection of such packets may be needed to exploit this vulnerability.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large IPv4 packets that require fragmentation and reassembly when packets requiring ALG inspection traverse a device that is configured for NAT and HSL.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT, HSL and ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.      ALG inspection is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled. ALG inspection engines available on Cisco IOS XE depend on the software version and may include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Skinny, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and other protocols.      Administrators can choose to disable any ALG inspection under the NAT configuration.      If the packet used in an exploit attempt does not require ALG inspection, this vulnerability can still be exploited if the zone-based policy firewall is configured, in addition to NAT and HSL, and processing such packets.      The following matrix shows the potential impact for a combination of enabled features and packets that may require ALG:      |  | Fragmented packets that may need ALG | Fragmented packets that do not need ALG |   | --- | --- | --- |   | NAT/HSL | Vulnerable | Not Vulnerable |   | NAT/HSL/zone-based policy firewall | Vulnerable | Vulnerable |            To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be on different interfaces and at least one **ip nat global** configuration command must be in the configuration.      The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:   ```   Router#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1   ```      To determine whether ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the **show **running-config** | include ip nat** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **no ip nat service** in the output of **show run | include ip nat** indicates that ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.      The following is the output of **show **running-config** | include ip nat** in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the SIP ALG disabled in the NAT configuration:   ```   Router#show running-config | include ip natip nat insideip nat outsideip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf sipno ip nat service sip udp port 5060no ip nat service sip tcp port 5060       ```      If **no ip nat service** is not in the output of **show running-config | include ip nat**, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on the device is vulnerable.      To determine whether HSL has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat log translations flow-export** command must be in the configuration.      The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether HSL is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:   ```   Router#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 ip nat log translations flow-export v9 udp destination 10.10.0.1 1020 source GigabitEthernet 0/0/0   ```      **Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted TCP Packet Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload or execute arbitrary code when processing crafted TCP packets that belong to a connection that is inspected by an AppNav-XE controller component. A device is vulnerable only if multiple AppNav-XE controllers are configured.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 TCP packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      The AppNav-XE controller component is not enabled by default.      To determine whether AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device, use the **show service-insertion appnav-controller-group** privileged EXEC command. The presence of multiple IP addresses under the configured **appnav-controller-group** in the output of **show service-insertion appnav-controller-group** indicates that AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device.      The following output is for AppNav-XE on Cisco IOS XE Software configured with multiple controllers:   ```   Router# show service-insertion appnav-controller-group All AppNav Controller Groups in service context Appnav Controller Group : acg Member Appnav Controller Count : 2 Members: IP Address 21.0.0.36 21.0.0.160	  AppNav Controller : 21.0.0.36 Local AppNav Controller : Yes Current status of AppNav Controller : Alive     ```      **Cisco IOS XE Software Crafted IPv6 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv6 packets when IPv6 is configured on an affected device.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv6 packets destined to an affected device. Packets transiting an affected device or IPv4 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv6 packets that require punt operations when a device is configured for IPv6.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if IPv6 is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. IPv6 is not enabled by default.      To determine whether IPv6 is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address)** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **ipv6 enable** and **ipv6 address** in the output of **show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address)** indicates that IPv6 is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address)** in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for IPv6:   ```   Router# show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) ipv6 enable  ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit ipv6 address autoconfig  ipv6 address MANAGEMENT ::1FFF:0:0:0:3560/128 ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/64      ```      **Cisco IOS XE Software Layer 4 Redirect Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets when Layer 4 Redirect (L4R) is configured on an affected device.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 or IPv6 subscriber packets transiting an affected device. In normal operation, those packets are redirected to specified servers when a device running Cisco IOS XE Software is configured for L4R functionality. Packets destined to an affected device cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets that require Layer 4 redirection when a device that is configured for L4R.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected if L4R is configured. L4R is not enabled by default.      To determine whether L4R is configured on a device, use the **show running-config | include redirect** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **redirect server-group** and **redirect to group** in the output of **show running-config | include redirect** indicates that L4R is enabled.      The following is the output of **show running-config | include redirect** in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for L4R:   ```   Router# show running-config | include redirect  redirect server-group TEST_SERVER  	redirect to group TEST_SERVER   ```      **Cisco IOS XE Software Common Flow Table Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing crafted IPv6 packets encapsulated in UDP IPv4 packets. A device is vulnerable only if Media Monitoring (MMON) traffic inspection or Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 UDP packets that are carrying IPv6 packets. Packets destined to an affected device, TCP IPv4 packets, or unencapsulated IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      MMON or NBAR traffic inspection is not enabled by default.      To determine whether MMON inspection of traffic is configured on a device, use the **show policy-map type performance-monitor** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **service-policy** in the output of **show policy-map type performance-monitor interface** indicates that MMON is configured on a device.      The following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with MMON:   ```   Router#show policy-map type performance-monitor      Service-policy performance-monitor input: mmon_policy     Class-map: class-default (match-any)       0 packets, 0 bytes      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps      Match: any      Total Packets classified: 0      Total Bytes classified: 0      Monitor AOR: disabled   Service-policy performance-monitor output: mmon_policy     Class-map: class-default (match-any)       0 packets, 0 bytes      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps      Match: any      Total Packets classified: 0      Total Bytes classified: 0      Monitor AOR: disabled ethernet 0/0   ```      NBAR inspection of IPv6 tunneled traffic on devices running Cisco IOS XE Software is supported for Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types.      To determine whether NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device, use the **show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip)** privileged EXEC command. The presence of either **ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip** or **ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo** in the output of **show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip)** indicates that the NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device.      The following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with NBAR traffic inspection for both Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types:   ```   Router# show run | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip) ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo   ```   Determine the Running Software VersionThe Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2. For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html>      To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:   ```   Router#show version Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Tue 07-Aug-12 13:40 by mcpre      ```      **Note:** A Cisco IOS XE Software image consists of seven individual modules, also referred to as packages. The packages are designed to use the In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) capability of Cisco IOS XE Software. Customers can choose to upgrade only those packages that need to be upgraded. For more information about the Cisco IOS XE Software packaging, see the following:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/product_bulletin_c25-448387.html>      If the packages were upgraded individually, the output of the **show version** command refers only to the IOS daemon (in the *rpios* package). Instead, you should use the **show version running** command because the vulnerabilities in this advisory belong to the *espbase* package. The version of the *espbase* package can be obtained using the **show version running | section espbase** command:   ```   Router#show version running | section espbasePackage: espbase, version: 03.10.03.S.153-3.S3-ext, status: active  File: bootflash:packages/asr1001-espbase.03.10.03.S.153-3.S3-ext.pkg, on: ESP0  Built: 2014-06-01_11.45, by: mcpre  File SHA1 checksum: f07a15e85bdd0c23603504ea56994924ec9c0ea6   ```   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableProducts running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      Cisco ASR 900 Series Routers are not affected by this vulnerability.      The Cisco 4300 Series ISRs are not affected because all Cisco IOS XE Software releases for that product already include the fixes for the vulnerabilities.      With the exception of Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers, Cisco 4400 Series ISRs, and Cisco CSR 1000v Series, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section provides additional information about each vulnerability.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Fragmented Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the high-speed logging (HSL) functionality of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC/E:/RL:/RC:/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
