Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0639:

**CVE-2015-0639: Cisco IOS XE Software Common Flow Table Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper processing of IPv6 packets encapsulated within IPv4 UDP packets by the Common Flow Table (CFT).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco IOS XE software handles IPv6 packets when they are tunneled inside IPv4 UDP packets, specifically when Media Monitoring (MMON) or Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 packets encapsulated in IPv4 UDP packets.
    *   The attack must be targeted at a device where either MMON traffic inspection or NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to send transit IPv4 UDP packets carrying IPv6 packets.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability is associated with Cisco bug ID CSCua79665.
*   MMON and NBAR traffic inspection are not enabled by default.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger security advisory that also covers other vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0640, CVE-2015-0641, CVE-2015-0644, CVE-2015-0645) affecting Cisco IOS XE Software.
*   The advisory details how to check if MMON or NBAR traffic inspection is configured by using the `show policy-map type performance-monitor` and `show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip)` commands respectively.
*   There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
*   The advisory provides details on which software versions contain fixes for this vulnerability.
