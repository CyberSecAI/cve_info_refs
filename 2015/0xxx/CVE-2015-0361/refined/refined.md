Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0361:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Premature freeing of data accessible via hypercalls by the domain controlling the execution of an HVM domain. This leads to use-after-free conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the Xen hypervisor during HVM guest teardown.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious or buggy stub domain kernel or tool stack (outside of Domain0) can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially affecting the entire system. This is primarily a crash vulnerability.
- The freed memory regions may be read from and written to in ways unexpected by their new owner.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires control over an HVM guest.
- A malicious or compromised stub domain or tool stack can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have control over a domain that manages or provides hardware emulation services to HVM guests. This includes control over the stub domain.
- The attacker does not need to be within dom0.

**Technical details:**

- The vulnerability affects Xen versions 4.2 and later on x86 systems. ARM systems are not vulnerable.
- It only applies to Xen systems using stub domains or other forms of control domain disaggregation for HVM guests.
- The issue is triggered during the teardown of an HVM guest.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves patching the Xen hypervisor. Patches are available for Xen unstable/4.4.x, 4.3.x, and 4.2.x.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mihai Don»õu from Bitdefender.
- Mitigation includes using only PV guests which are not affected.
- Several openSUSE security updates address this vulnerability including openSUSE-SU-2015:0226-1 and openSUSE-SU-2015:0256-1
- Gentoo also released a security advisory GLSA 201504-04 for this issue.
