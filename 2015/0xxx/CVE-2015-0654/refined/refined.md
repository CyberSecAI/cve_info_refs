Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0654:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A race condition exists within the SSL/TLS subsystem of the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) software when handling multiple HTTPS requests on the management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the way the IPS software handles concurrent SSL/TLS connections on its web management interface, specifically, a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit can render the *MainApp* process unresponsive, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   The DoS condition prevents critical tasks such as alert notification, event store management, and sensor authentication from being executed.
*   The Cisco IPS web server becomes unavailable.
*   Other processes like the Analysis Engine may also malfunction, potentially leading to incorrect inspection and mitigation actions in inline mode or unavailability of certain features in promiscuous mode.
*   The device may drop packets when configured in inline mode due to the impact on inspection and mitigation capabilities.
*   The device requires a restart to recover from the DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, targeting the management interface of the Cisco IPS device.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by negotiating multiple HTTPS connections with the management interface, specifically through SSL/TLS traffic directed to the management interface's TCP port (default 443).
*   Packets traversing the sensing interfaces of the IPS device cannot trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the management interface of the affected Cisco IPS device.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to the IPS device in order to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs the ability to establish multiple SSL/TLS connections to trigger the race condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is documented under Cisco Bug ID [CSCuq40652](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq40652)
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco IPS devices running version 7.2(1)E4 or later. A list of vulnerable hardware models is provided.
*   Cisco released IPS software version 7.3(3)E4 to remediate the vulnerability.
*   There is no workaround for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco recommends maintaining an IPS management access list to allow only trusted hosts to access the management interface to help prevent successful exploitation.
