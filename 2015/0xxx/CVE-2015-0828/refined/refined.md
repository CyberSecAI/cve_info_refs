Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a double-free error that occurs when an XmlHttpRequest (XHR) with a zero-length response is processed using a non-default memory allocator. This happens because some memory allocators handle `realloc(ptr, 0)` differently than `jemalloc`, the memory allocator used by default in Mozilla builds. Specifically, these allocators may free the provided pointer (`ptr`) when `realloc(ptr, 0)` is called. If `realloc(ptr, 0)` is called again with the same pointer after it has been freed, a double-free occurs. This double-free leads to a crash in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double-Free:** The core issue is a double-free vulnerability due to inconsistent behavior of `realloc(ptr, 0)` across different memory allocators.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Double-free vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption and unpredictable application behavior, including crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact is an exploitable crash of the application (Firefox or SeaMonkey) due to the double-free. This can lead to denial of service.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly detailed, a double-free vulnerability can sometimes be a precursor to more serious exploits, such as arbitrary code execution, if an attacker gains enough control over memory allocation and layout.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted web page that sends a zero-length XHR request.
*   **User Interaction:**  The user needs to visit the malicious page or initiate the vulnerable XHR request indirectly, though specific user action beyond visiting a web page is not required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Delivery:** The attacker can be remote, needing to host the malicious web content on a server or embed it within a page the victim might visit.
*   **Minimal User Action:** The user just needs to access the malicious web page.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present when using non-default memory allocators, which is not the standard configuration for Firefox builds.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using Address Sanitizer (ASan) tool.
*   The bug report indicates that some C89 compliant implementations of `realloc` free the memory if a size of 0 is given to realloc, while this is not the case in C99.
*   The fix involves avoiding calls to realloc with a size of 0 when using `ArrayBufferBuilder::setCapacity`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 36 and SeaMonkey 2.33.

**Summary**

CVE-2015-0828 describes a double-free vulnerability in Firefox and SeaMonkey due to differing implementations of `realloc` when zero size is requested, only occuring in non-default builds. An attacker could exploit this by making the user load specially crafted web content that triggers a zero-length XHR request leading to a denial-of-service condition via a crash.
