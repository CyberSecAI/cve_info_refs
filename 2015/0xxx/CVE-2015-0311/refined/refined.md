Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-0311 from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, which can lead to unexpected behavior or allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*  Remote attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Flash Player process.
*  Successful exploitation could cause a crash.
*  Attackers could take control of the affected system.
*  Denial of service condition.
*  Obtain sensitive information or bypass security restrictions.

**Attack vectors:**
*  Drive-by-download attacks via specially crafted websites that exploit the vulnerability.
*  Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content/ads with malicious Flash content.
*  Exploitation through Internet Explorer and Firefox on Windows 8.1 and below.
*  Malicious SWF files, which can be delivered via malvertising or directly on compromised sites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*  The attacker needs to host malicious content on a web server or compromise a website to inject malicious content.
*  They must convince users to visit the attacker-controlled content or open a malicious SWF file. This can be done through social engineering, such as sending links in emails or instant messages or by using malvertising.
*   The attacker leverages the vulnerability in Flash Player to execute code remotely.
*   The attacker does not need local access to the system, and the attack is typically performed remotely over the internet.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious SWF file that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild as a zero-day, first seen with the Angler Exploit Kit.
*   Multiple exploit kits like Angler, RIG, Fiesta, Nuclear Pack, Sweet Orange, Neutrino, and Magnitude integrated this exploit in short order.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Flash Player across various operating systems.
*  This vulnerability was used in standalone mode to spread malware, not only via exploit kits.
