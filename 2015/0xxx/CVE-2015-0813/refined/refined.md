Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0813:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `lists.opensuse.org`, `rhn.redhat.com` and `www.ubuntu.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2015-0813 as being addressed in their respective security updates for Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.
* The content from `www.mozilla.org` also directly references the CVE in their security advisory.
* The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com` also mentions it.
* The content from `www.suse.com` also mentions it and describes it as a use-after-free vulnerability.
* The content from `bugzilla.mozilla.org` also directly references the CVE and the description of it.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `AppendElements` function. This is triggered when using the Fluendo MP3 plugin for GStreamer on Linux. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because of a flaw in handling certain MP3 files by the plugin and how it interacts with Mozilla code. The issue is tied to incorrect memory management and deallocation of memory for audio data, which leads to use-after-free scenarios when playing such mp3 files. The issue is also present with WebRTC usage and specifically with MediaStream playback.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Use-after-free vulnerability: Memory is accessed after it has been freed, causing memory corruption. The issue is triggered by a specially crafted MP3 file or certain sequences of operations while using GStreamer's MP3 plugin on Linux systems. Specifically the vulnerability occurs during processing MP3 audio using the Fluendo plugin for GStreamer, causing a flaw with handling of the mp3 data and the plugin's interaction with Mozilla code. There is also the case of WebRTC when using MediaStream playback.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use-after-free condition can cause Firefox/Thunderbird to crash.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** In some scenarios, exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to open a specially crafted web page containing a malicious MP3 file. This vulnerability is specifically related to processing mp3 audio on Linux system with the Fluendo plugin for GStreamer. It can also be exploited when viewing a specially crafted website.
    *   **User-Assisted:** The user must interact with a malicious web page, either by visiting it directly or opening a mail message that renders the malicious content. The user would need to open a specially crafted mail message with scripting enabled, or view a specially crafted web page, which leads to exploitation.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or send a malicious mail message to a user of a vulnerable Firefox or Thunderbird application and trick them into opening it.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific MP3 file or use certain audio processing techniques to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The target system has to be running on Linux and be using the affected version of Firefox, Thunderbird and the Fluendo MP3 plugin.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects primarily Linux systems where the Fluendo MP3 GStreamer plugin is used and not Windows or macOS.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 37, Firefox ESR 31.6, and Thunderbird 31.6.
*   Patches are available in several Linux distributions for this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability has been described as a use-after-free condition in function `AppendElements`
* The vulnerability was reported by Aki Helin.

In summary, CVE-2015-0813 is a use-after-free vulnerability affecting Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird on Linux systems when processing MP3 audio with the Fluendo plugin. It allows for remote attackers to potentially cause a DoS or execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
