Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the SSH subsystem of Cisco Nexus family of products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a bypass of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) restrictions. This means that an attacker, after initially authenticating, can circumvent the expected access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass AAA restrictions which leads to:
    - Complete Confidentiality Impact: The attacker can read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.).
    - Complete Integrity Impact: The attacker can modify any files on the target system.
    - Complete Availability Impact: The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, leveraging SSH access to the vulnerable devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to initially authenticate to the device via SSH. After the initial authentication is successful, the attacker can bypass AAA restrictions.
- Remote network access to the device is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Cisco Nexus products including:
    - Multilayer Director Switches
