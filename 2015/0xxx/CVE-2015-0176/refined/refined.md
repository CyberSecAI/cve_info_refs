- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MQ XR WebSockets Listener does not properly sanitize the URI in error responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a victim's web browser, within the security context of the hosting website. This could be leveraged to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL is used to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click on it.
