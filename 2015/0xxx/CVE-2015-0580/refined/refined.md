Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0580:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the reporting application within Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS). This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The primary vulnerability is that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, which can be used to construct malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on one of the ACS View databases.
- This could allow the attacker to access and modify sensitive information, such as RADIUS accounting records.
- It could also grant the attacker access to information in the underlying file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely over HTTPS
- It requires the attacker to be authenticated with an ACS administrator account

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an ACS administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application over HTTPS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Cisco Secure ACS versions prior to version 5.5 patch 8.
- Cisco Secure ACS versions 5.6 and later are not affected.
- There is no known workaround for this vulnerability. Upgrading to patch 8 or later is required to remediate the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Lukasz Plonka from ING Services Polska.
