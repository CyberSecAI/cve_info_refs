Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0795:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `www.zerodayinitiative.com` explicitly mentions "CVE-2015-0795" and describes a vulnerability in "NetIQ Security Solutions for ISeries" related to the `NetIQExecObject.NetIQExec.1` ActiveX control. This matches the CVE ID and product.
*   The content from `www.microfocus.com` also references "ZDI-CAN-2699/CVE-2015-0795" and "NetIQ Security Solutions for iSeries" with details about the vulnerable `NetIQExec.dll`. This confirms relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a stack buffer overflow in the `SafeShellExecute` function of the `NetIQExecObject.NetIQExec.1` ActiveX control.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `SafeShellExecute` function does not properly validate the length of arguments passed to it, allowing an attacker to write beyond the boundaries of a fixed-size stack buffer.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerable functionality resides within an ActiveX control, which can be exploited through web pages or other means.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Browser Context:** The code execution occurs in the context of the browser.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control to trigger the overflow.
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker could embed the malicious ActiveX control in a file, such as an HTML file, that, when opened, would trigger the overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires some level of user interaction, such as visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.
*   **Vulnerable Software:** The target system must have the vulnerable "NetIQ Security Solutions for ISeries" software installed and be using a browser that enables ActiveX controls.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) working with Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   The vulnerability does not affect the IBM i5OS server itself, only the client system where the ActiveX control is used.
*   The vendor, NetIQ (now Micro Focus), addressed the vulnerability by updating the download package to remove the vulnerable `NetIQExec.dll` and no longer restore the DLL during self-extracting execution.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a Digital Vaccine protection filter.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-0795 is a remote code execution vulnerability caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `SafeShellExecute` function of the `NetIQExecObject.NetIQExec.1` ActiveX control. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file containing the ActiveX control, which can result in arbitrary code execution on the user's system within the browser's context. This vulnerability was patched by Micro Focus, and TippingPoint IPS provides protection against it.
