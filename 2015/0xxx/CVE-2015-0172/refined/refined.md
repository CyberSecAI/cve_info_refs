{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The IBM Security SiteProtector System has a default configuration that does not require client authentication for communication between managed agents and the Agent Manager component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Security bypass vulnerability due to lack of client authentication by default.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially bypass security controls due to the lack of client authentication in the default configuration.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network communication between managed agents and the Agent Manager component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to communicate with the Agent Manager component using the same network as the managed agents."
