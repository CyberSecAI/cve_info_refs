{
  "CVE-2015-0205": {
    "Description": "The ssl3_get_cert_verify function in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k accepts client authentication with a Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificate without requiring a CertificateVerify message, which allows remote attackers to obtain access without knowledge of a private key via crafted TLS Handshake Protocol traffic to a server that recognizes a Certification Authority with DH support.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because the ssl3_get_cert_verify function in OpenSSL does not enforce the requirement for a CertificateVerify message when client authentication with a DH certificate is used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Certificate Validation",
      "Missing Certificate Verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can gain unauthorized access to a server without knowing the private key, by exploiting a vulnerability in OpenSSL's handling of DH client certificates during the TLS handshake.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can send crafted TLS Handshake Protocol traffic to a vulnerable server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft specific TLS handshake traffic and target a server recognizing a Certification Authority with DH support."
