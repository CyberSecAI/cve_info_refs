The vulnerability was tested on Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7. It bypasses the Same Origin Policy (SOP). The attack injects content into another domain while the address bar of the browser displays the legitimate domain. Attackers can leverage this to perform phishing attacks."

It is rated as Important/EoP on Windows clients and Low/EoP on Windows servers. Mitigating factors include websites that set the X-Frame-Options HTTP header to SAMEORIGIN or DENY are not affected as these cannot be loaded in iframes."

The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 11, possibly other newer versions but not IE 8. Websites can protect themselves by using the X-Frame-Options header set to 'deny' or 'same-origin'. Microsoft is working on a security update and encourages users to avoid untrusted links."
