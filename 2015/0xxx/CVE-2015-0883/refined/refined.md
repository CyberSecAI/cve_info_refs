Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `mailauth` module of SYNCK GRAPHICA's Mailform Pro CGI. Specifically, a flaw in the email sending process allows for arbitrary code execution. This is due to a code injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The application is susceptible to code injection, likely due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input when processing email addresses, which leads to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the vulnerable application is hosted. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (Remote):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the network, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send input to the vulnerable `mailauth` module, likely through a web form. No authentication is needed.
- The attacker does not require any prior access to the server or special permissions.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability is present in Mailform Pro CGI versions 4.1.4 and 4.1.5, specifically when the `mailauth` module is enabled.
- The vendor recommends updating to version 4.2.0, which includes a fix for the vulnerability, or disabling the `mailauth` module as a workaround.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-94: Code Injection
- The CVSS v2 base score is 6.8, classifying it as a medium severity issue.
