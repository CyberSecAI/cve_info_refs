# USN-2626-1: Qt vulnerabilities

3 June 2015

Qt could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [qt4-x11](/security/cves?package=qt4-x11) - Qt 4 libraries
* [qtbase-opensource-src](/security/cves?package=qtbase-opensource-src) - Qt 5 libraries

## Details

Wolfgang Schenk discovered that Qt incorrectly handled certain malformed

GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted GIF image, a remote attacker could use this issue to

cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0190](/security/CVE-2014-0190))

Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled certain malformed BMP

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially

crafted BMP image, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause Qt to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0295](/security/CVE-2015-0295))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed BMP images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted BMP image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1858](/security/CVE-2015-1858))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed ICO images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted ICO image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1859](/security/CVE-2015-1859))

Richard Moore and Fabian Vogt discovered that Qt incorrectly handled

certain malformed GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted GIF image, a remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Qt to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1860](/security/CVE-2015-1860))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905742#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-17 13:31:29 UTC  ``` KDE Project Security Advisory =============================  Title: Insufficient Input Validation By IO Slaves and Webkit Part Risk Rating: Low CVE: CVE-2014-8600 Platforms: All Versions:  kwebkitpart <= 1.3.4, kde-runtime <= 4.14.3, kio-extras <= 5.1.1 Author: Albert Astals Cid <aacid@kde.org> Date: 13 November 2014  Overview ========  kwebkitpart and the bookmarks:// io slave were not sanitizing input correctly allowing to some javascript being executed on the context of the referenced hostname. For example going to    bookmarks://hhdhdhhdhdhdh.google.com/'><script>alert('bookmarks'+document.domain);</script> in Konqueror makes a Javascript alert popup.  Impact ======  Whilst in most cases, the JavaScript will be executed in an untrusted context, with the bookmarks IO slave, it will be executed in the context of the referenced hostname. In the example above, this is hhdhdhhdhdhdh.google.com. It should however be noted that KDE mitigates this risk by attempting to ensure that such URLs cannot be embedded directly into Internet hosted content.  Solution ========  Update to newer versions of kwebkitpart, kde-runtime, kio-extras when released. Meanwhile apply the following patches:   kwebkitpart     <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kwebkitpart.git&a=commit&h=641aa7c75631084260ae89aecbdb625e918c6689>    kde-runtime     <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-runtime.git&a=commit&h=d68703900edc8416fbcd2550cd336cbbb76decb9>    kio-extras     <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kio-extras.git&a=commit&h=13155c8eb71d1c946bea21c38ea0f8ca7c7013cd>  Credits =======  Thanks to Tim Brown and Darron Burton of Portcullis Security for reporting Thanks to David Daure and Martin Sandsmark for the patches  References: <https://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20141113-1.txt> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1164293> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8600> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8600> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=905742#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-17 23:00:43 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=905742#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-19 12:06:20 UTC  ``` Further details in  <https://www.portcullis-security.com/security-research-and-downloads/security-advisories/cve-2014-8600/> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=905742#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-03-23 17:05:50 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0573-1: An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
