| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software IPv6 Malformed Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20150220-ipv6  First Published: 2015 February 20 16:30 GMT  Last Updated:  2015 February 24 01:19 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuq95241](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq95241)     CVE-2015-0618     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.1, Temporal 5.9](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2015-0618     CWE-20       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the parsing of malformed IP version 6 (IPv6) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS 6000) and Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a line card that is processing traffic.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products   Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS 6000) and Cisco Carrier Routing System X (CRS-X) running an affected version of Cisco IOS XR Software are affected by this vulnerability.      All flavors of Cisco CRS-X line cards are affected by this vulnerability, including Cisco CRS-X 400-Gbps Modular Services Card (MSC-X) and Cisco CRS-X 400-Gbps Forwarding Processor Cards (FP-X).      Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory for the details of affected releases.      A device running an affected version of Cisco IOS XR Software release that has IPv6 enabled will display interfaces with assigned IPv6 addresses when the **show ipv6 interface brief** command is issued.      The **show ipv6 interface brief** command will produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not support IPv6, or will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is disabled. The system is not vulnerable in either scenario.      The following example shows the output from the **show ipv6 interface** **brief** command issued on a device running Cisco IOS XR Software with IPv6 enabled:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief      GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up] fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150  202::1    ``` The IPv6 protocol is enabled if the interface configuration command **ipv6 enable** is present in the configuration. The following examples show a vulnerable configuration:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0	  RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router(config-if)# ipv6 enable   ```    To determine the Cisco IOS XR Software release and the exact name of the product on which it runs, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software by displaying "Cisco IOS XR Software" or similar text.       The location and name of the system image file currently running on the router are displayed under the "System image file is" text.   The hardware product is indicated in the line following the name of the system image file.      The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 4.1.0 with an installed image name of *mbihfr-rp.vm*:          ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show version Mon May 31 02:14:12.722 DST Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 4.1.0 Copyright (c) 2010 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Cisco 12000 Series Routers, Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, Cisco Carrier Routing System 1 (CRS-1) or Cisco Carrier Routing System 3 (CRS-3) running Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the parsing of malformed IP version 6 (IPv6) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 (NCS 6000) and Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of a line card that is processing traffic.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed IPv6 packets carrying extension headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet, carrying extension headers, through an affected Cisco IOS XR device line card. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the line card on the affected Cisco IOS XR device.      This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.      A device is vulnerable only if it is configured to process IPv6 traffic passing through the device.       This vulnerability can be exploited using only IPv6 packets. A crafted IPv6 packet carrying extension headers can trigger the vulnerability.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by the traffic transiting an affected device. IPv4 traffic, or IPv6 traffic destined to an affected device cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability on an affected device.      While certain intermediate devices may block malformed IPv6 packets, the possibility still exists for a malformed packet to originate from a remote network and exploit this vulnerability on an affected device.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuq95241](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq95241) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) CVE-2015-0618.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       Cisco IOS XR release version 5.2.3 for Cisco NCS 6000 is not affected by this vulnerability. All other releases of Cisco IOS XR for Cisco NCS 6000 are affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS XR release version 5.3.0 for CRS-X is not affected by this vulnerability. All other releases of Cisco IOS XR for CRS-X that have a support for Cisco CRS-X line cards, including Cisco CRS-X 400-Gbps Modular Service Card (MSC-X) and Cisco CRS-X 400-Gbps Forwarding Processor Cards (FP-X) are affected by this vulnerability.
