Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information. The password used to unlock the PLC for modification is transmitted in cleartext over the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:** Passwords are sent without encryption, making them vulnerable to interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Compromise of sensitive account information (specifically, the PLC unlock password).
- Potential for unauthorized modification of the PLC.
- This could lead to a loss of control over the industrial process and potential disruption of operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network packet sniffing: An attacker positioned on the network can intercept the unencrypted password transmitted during PLC unlocking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept traffic between the programming software and the PLC.
- Low skill: The vulnerability is described as exploitable by an attacker with low skill.
