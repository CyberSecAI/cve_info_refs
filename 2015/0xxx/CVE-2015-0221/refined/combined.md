## Security releases issued

Posted by **Tim Graham** on Jan. 13, 2015

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.18, Django 1.6.10, and Django 1.7.3 -- as
part of [our security process](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/). These releases are now
available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django) and [our download page](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/).

These releases address several security issues. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade
as soon as possible.

### Issue: WSGI header spoofing via underscore/dash conflation

When HTTP headers are placed into the WSGI environ, they are normalized
by converting to uppercase, converting all dashes to underscores, and
prepending HTTP\_. For instance, a header X-Auth-User would become
HTTP\_X\_AUTH\_USER in the WSGI environ (and thus also in Django's
request.META dictionary).

Unfortunately, this means that the WSGI environ cannot distinguish
between headers containing dashes and headers containing underscores:
X-Auth-User and X-Auth\_User both become HTTP\_X\_AUTH\_USER.
This means that if a header is used in a security-sensitive way (for
instance, passing authentication information along from a front-end
proxy), even if the proxy carefully strips any incoming value for
X-Auth-User, an attacker may be able to provide an X-Auth\_User
header (with underscore) and bypass this protection.

In order to prevent such attacks, both Nginx and Apache 2.4+ strip all
headers containing underscores from incoming requests by default.
Django's built-in development server now does the same. Django's
development server is not recommended for production use, but matching
the behavior of common production servers reduces the surface area for
behavior changes during deployment.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-0219.

Thanks to Jedediah Smith for reporting the issue.

### Issue: Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs

Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
django.contrib.auth.views.login()
and i18n) to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security
checks for these redirects (namely django.util.http.is\_safe\_url())
didn't strip leading whitespace on the tested URL and as such considered
URLs like \njavascript:... safe. If a developer relied on
is\_safe\_url() to provide safe redirect targets and put such a URL
into a link, they could suffer from a XSS attack. This bug doesn't
affect Django currently, since we only put this URL into the
Location response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript there.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-0220.

Thanks to Mikko Ohtamaa for reporting the issue.

### Issue: Denial-of-service attack against django.views.static.serve

In older versions of Django, the django.views.static.serve() view
read the files it served one line at a time. Therefore, a big file with
no newlines would result in memory usage equal to the size of that file.
An attacker could exploit this and launch a denial-of-service attack by
simultaneously requesting many large files. This view now reads the file
in chunks to prevent large memory usage.

Note, however, that this view has always carried a warning that it is
not hardened for production use and should be used only as a development
aid. Now may be a good time to audit your project and serve your files
in production using a real front-end web server if you are not doing so.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-0221.

Thanks Alex Gaynor for reporting the issue.

### Issue: Database denial-of-service with ModelMultipleChoiceField

Given a form that uses ModelMultipleChoiceField and
show\_hidden\_initial=True (not a documented API), it was possible for
a user to cause an unreasonable number of SQL queries by submitting
duplicate values for the field's data. The validation logic in
ModelMultipleChoiceField now deduplicates submitted values to
address this issue.

This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-0222.

Thanks Keryn Knight for reporting the issue.

### Affected versions

* Django master development branch (currently at pre-alpha status) (except the serve() denial of service issue)
* Django 1.7
* Django 1.6
* Django 1.4 [Long-term support] (except the ModelMultipleChoiceField issue)

Per our [supported versions policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#supported-versions), Django 1.5 is no longer receiving security updates.

### General notes regarding security reporting

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's
Trac instance or the django-developers list. Please see [our security
policies](https://www.djangoproject.com/security/) for further
information.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2015-5963 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5963)

#### Description

contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware in Django 1.8.x before 1.8.4, 1.7.x before 1.7.10, 1.4.x before 1.4.22, and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session store consumption or session record removal) via a large number of requests to contrib.auth.views.logout, which triggers the creation of an empty session record.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
