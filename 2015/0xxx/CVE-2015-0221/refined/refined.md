{
  "CVE-2015-0221": {
    "description": "The django.views.static.serve view in Django before 1.4.18, 1.6.x before 1.6.10, and 1.7.x before 1.7.3 reads files an entire line at a time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a long line in a file.",
    "root_cause": "The `django.views.static.serve()` view reads files line by line, leading to excessive memory usage when encountering a large file without newlines.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of file reading operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending HTTP requests to access large files without newlines via the vulnerable view."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication. They just need to send a request to the vulnerable `django.views.static.serve` view."
