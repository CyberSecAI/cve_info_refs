Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the code used by multiple IBM products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive user information, such as session cookies or credentials.

    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web page viewed by the user.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- The CVSS vector indicates a potential for "Partial" impact on integrity (I:P), meaning the attacker could alter data or modify the content of a web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network (AV:N).
- **Medium Complexity:** The attack requires medium complexity (AC:M).
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated (Au:S) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
