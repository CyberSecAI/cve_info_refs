Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `arj` archiver's insufficient handling of leading slashes in file paths within ARJ archives. While the archiver attempts to prevent directory traversal by stripping a single leading slash, it fails to do so when multiple leading slashes are present (e.g., `//tmp/moo`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to perform absolute path traversal. By including multiple leading slashes in an archive, an attacker can force the archiver to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The archiver's logic for stripping leading slashes is flawed, making it susceptible to bypass via multiple leading slashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system, potentially overwriting existing files, creating new files, or even modifying critical system files.
*   **Code Execution:** Although not directly stated, the ability to write arbitrary files can lead to code execution by overwriting configuration or executable files, depending on the target environment.
*   **Denial of Service:** By overwriting critical files, an attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ARJ Archive:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted ARJ archive containing file paths with multiple leading slashes.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user or automated system to extract the malicious archive using the vulnerable `arj` archiver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **ARJ Archive Creation:** An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious ARJ archive with paths containing multiple leading slashes.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user or automated system to extract the crafted archive using the vulnerable `arj` software.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Wilk.
* The issue was assigned CVE-2015-0557 and was addressed in `arj` version 3.10.22-13, 3.10.22-10+deb7u1, and 3.10.22-9+deb6u1
* This vulnerability is closely related to CVE-2015-0556, which was a symlink directory traversal vulnerability in the same archiver, and CVE-2015-2782, a buffer overflow vulnerability, also in the same archiver.
