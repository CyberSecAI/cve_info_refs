      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-0071",
      "description": "Security feature bypass vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use a ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.",
      "root_cause": "Internet Explorer does not properly implement the ASLR security feature.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "ASLR Bypass"
      ],
       "impact": "Bypassing ASLR makes it easier for an attacker to exploit other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution vulnerabilities, as it allows them to predict memory locations.",
      "attack_vector": "Web browsing scenario where a user visits a malicious webpage.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a specially crafted website. An attacker needs to also leverage another vulnerability such as RCE."
