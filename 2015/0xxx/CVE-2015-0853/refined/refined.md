Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0853:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `os.system()` function within the `svn-workbench` application, specifically in the `wb_shell_unix_commands.py` file. This function is used to execute shell commands, and it directly incorporates user-controlled input (filename/path) without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `filename` variable before passing it to `os.system()`.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a directory name that includes shell metacharacters (e.g., `$(command)`).
*   **Insecure Function Usage:** Using `os.system()` to execute external commands based on user-provided input is inherently risky and should be avoided in favor of safer alternatives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running `svn-workbench`.
*   **System Compromise:** Depending on the attacker's goals and the available system tools, this could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, denial of service, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Directory Name:** An attacker can create a directory with a name that includes shell injection sequences (e.g., `$(xeyes)` or `$(malicious_command)`).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into using the "Command Shell" menu item within `svn-workbench` while being in the crafted directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a directory** on a filesystem that the victim can access
*   **Knowledge of how to use the "Command Shell" menu item** of `svn-workbench`.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to actively use the "Command Shell" option in the specially crafted directory.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is located in `Source/wb_shell_unix_commands.py` at line 53:
```python
def ShellOpen( app, project_info, filename ):
    app.log.info( T_('Open %s') % filename )
    cur_dir = os.getcwd()
    try:
        wb_platform_specific.uChdir( project_info.getWorkingDir() )
        os.system( "xdg-open '%s'" % filename )
    finally:
        wb_platform_specific.uChdir( cur_dir )
```
The `os.system( "xdg-open '%s'" % filename )` line is the vulnerable part, where `filename` (representing the directory path) is passed to `os.system()` without any sanitization, allowing for command injection.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in `svn-workbench` and not in `pysvn`, although both projects are related.
* The fix involves replacing `os.system()` with a more secure method, like `subprocess.call()`.
* The issue affects versions 1.6.2 and earlier of `svn-workbench`.
*  The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.7.0-1 of `svn-workbench`.
