Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper input validation within the `shiromuku(bu2)BBS` bulletin board software. This allows a remote attacker to manipulate input and create arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to create files with attacker-controlled content and names on the server's file system. This arises from inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):**  The software fails to properly validate or sanitize user input, leading to the file creation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By creating arbitrary files, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be achieved by creating or modifying configuration files, scripts, or other executable files within the webserver's environment.
- **Compromise of Server:** Successful exploitation could lead to full compromise of the server, including data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access to the server. They can send malicious requests over the network to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, making it highly accessible to attackers.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Software:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable software (shiromuku(bu2)BBS) and its associated weaknesses.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `shiromuku(bu2)BBS` versions 2.90 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Shoji Baba and subsequently to JPCERT/CC.
- The vendor, Perl CGI's By Mrs. Shiromuku, has released an update to version 2.91, which fixes the arbitrary file creation vulnerability.
- The advisory recommends that users update their software to the latest version.
