{
  "CVE-2015-0799": {
    "Description": "The HTTP Alternative Services feature in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0.1 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass an intended X.509 certificate-verification step for an SSL server by specifying that server in the uri-host field of an Alt-Svc HTTP/2 response header.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) implementation in Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, the browser does not properly perform X.509 certificate verification when an alternate server is specified in the `uri-host` field of an `Alt-Svc` header, allowing a MITM attacker to potentially bypass intended certificate checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate validation",
       "Bypass of security checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can bypass SSL certificate verification for a server. This can lead to an attacker impersonating a legitimate server and potentially performing malicious actions, such as intercepting traffic, exfiltrating user data or injecting malicious content.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
     "Man-in-the-middle (MITM)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the target server. This can be achieved by compromising network infrastructure or performing DNS poisoning.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be triggered when a HTTP/2 server sends a Alt-Svc header. An attacker who performs a MITM can use this to make the client use a different host with a potentially self-signed or incorrect certificate."
