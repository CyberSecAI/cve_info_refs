Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the OpenType Sanitizer (OTS) library, specifically within the `ots::ots_gasp_parse` function. This occurs when a macro, `DROP_THIS_TABLE`, deletes a structure containing font data (`file->gasp`) before a member of that structure (`gasp->version`) is accessed, leading to a use-after-free condition. The macro is expanded at the callsite to delete the structure then attempt to use it,

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. Memory allocated for the `gasp` structure is freed, and then a dangling pointer to this freed memory is accessed when the `gasp->version` is read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** According to the ubuntu security notice, this vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted website, potentially causing a denial of service through an application crash, though the bugzilla entry notes that the impact is low as the use after free was only used to generate console output.
- **Application Crash:** The use-after-free leads to a crash, preventing the application from continuing to function normally.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted website:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a malicious website.
- **Font Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of font data (specifically OpenType fonts), which is often part of a webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host or distribute malicious websites:** An attacker needs the capability to host a website with the malicious font or entice users to visit a compromised site.
- **Understanding of font file structure:** The attacker needs to craft a specially crafted font file to trigger the vulnerability in the OTS library.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Not Directly Exploitable:** While a crash results from this vulnerability, according to the bugzilla entry, the use-after-free itself is not directly exploitable for arbitrary code execution, since the freed memory is accessed to output to a console.
- **Security Rating: Low**: The security risk for CVE-2015-0823 was rated as *sec-low* because the use-after-free was for an informational message.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed by updating the OTS library to the latest version and modifying the `DROP_THIS_TABLE` macro so the message is printed before deletion.
- **Affected Software:** Firefox, Thunderbird, and Seamonkey were all affected by this vulnerability.
- **Patch Information:** Patches were made available for Ubuntu, openSUSE and Gentoo.

In summary, CVE-2015-0823 is a use-after-free vulnerability within the OpenType Sanitizer library that, when triggered, can cause a crash within affected applications. An attacker would need to craft a malicious webpage with a specially crafted font to exploit the vulnerability.
