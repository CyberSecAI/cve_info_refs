Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-0505:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An unspecified vulnerability exists in Oracle MySQL Server related to DDL (Data Definition Language). This means that the vulnerability lies within the code that handles operations like creating, altering, or dropping database objects (tables, indexes, etc.).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of DDL operations within the MySQL server. The specific flaw is not detailed in the provided sources, but it relates to how the server processes these operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to affect the availability of the MySQL server. This means that the server could crash, hang, or become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a "complete DOS" of MySQL Server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network communication. Specifically, the vulnerable code is exposed via "multiple protocols" that the MySQL server listens on.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an "authenticated user". This means they require valid credentials to connect to the MySQL server. The level of privileges required by the attacker for successful exploitation is not detailed.
-  The vulnerability is described as "easily exploitable" (in the context of Red Hat), which indicates the attacker does not require highly specialized skills.
- The SUSE advisory indicates the attacker would need a "single" authentication context.
- The attack can originate remotely over the network.
