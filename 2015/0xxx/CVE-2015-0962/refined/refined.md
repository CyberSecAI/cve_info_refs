Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-0962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Barracuda Web Filter versions between 7.0 and 8.1.0.005 ship with one of three default root CA certificates that are shared across multiple machines. These certificates are used for SSL inspection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shared Root CA Certificate:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the same, limited set of root CA certificates are deployed across multiple Barracuda Web Filter appliances. This is a critical weakness because a single compromise of a shared certificate impacts all systems using that certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can leverage the shared CA certificate to conduct a MITM attack. The attacker can use the compromised certificate to intercept and decrypt SSL/TLS traffic between the client and server without the client being aware of the ongoing attack, thus being able to eavesdrop or alter traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromise of a Shared Certificate:** An attacker would need to obtain one of the default, shared root CA certificates. This could potentially be done via supply-chain attack, a vulnerable appliance, or other means.
*   **Network Level Attack:** Once the attacker possesses a valid certificate, they can intercept network traffic and impersonate legitimate websites, allowing them to monitor or modify user traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Possession of Shared Certificate:** The attacker must acquire one of the shared default root CA certificates.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept traffic going through the Barracuda Web Filter.
*   **Ability to Impersonate Servers:** The attacker must be able to use the certificate to create fake certificates for arbitrary domains.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Barracuda Web Filter versions between 7.0 and 8.1.0.005 are affected.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.1.0.005, where each appliance generates a unique default certificate.
*   Users who have configured SSL Inspection and used default certificates must update their appliances, remove old certificates and deploy new certificates.
*   A tool is provided by Barracuda to check if browsers trust the compromised certificates and instructions on how to remove these from the trust store.
