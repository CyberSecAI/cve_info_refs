Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-0615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the SIP call handling code not releasing allocated resources under specific connection scenarios. This occurs when a SIP session is abnormally terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper resource management in SIP call handling code. Specifically, failure to release allocated resources when a SIP session is abnormally terminated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to consumption of all available SIP ports on the Cisco Unity Connection server.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the system becomes unable to accept new connections, and all SIP lines will respond with a 503 error, indicating all ports are busy.
- Recovery requires a manual restart of the conversation manager by the Cisco Unity Connection administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker.
- Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by abnormally terminating a SIP session.
- This vulnerability is independent of the transport protocols used, and can be exploited with UDP, TCP, or TLS connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the affected Cisco Unity Connection server.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.
- The attacker must be able to terminate SIP sessions abnormally.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is documented under Cisco bug ID CSCul28089.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is: Base 7.1, Temporal 5.9 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)
- This vulnerability affects Cisco Unity Connection installations that use SIP trunk integration, not SCCP integration.
- The fix is included in Cisco Unity Connection versions 8.5(1)SU7, 8.6(2a)SU4, 9.1(2)SU2, and 10.0(1)SU1.
