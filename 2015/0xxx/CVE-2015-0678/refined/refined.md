Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2015-0678:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the virtualization layer of Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services and Cisco ASA Context-Aware (CX) Services. It stems from the improper handling of crafted packets sent at a high rate to the management interface of these services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted network packets.
- Specifically, a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability arises from the system's inability to manage a high volume of crafted packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload (crash) of the affected system, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via network.
- The attacker sends a high rate of crafted packets to the management interface of the affected Cisco ASA FirePOWER or CX service.
- Exploitation can occur over both IPv4 and IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the management interface of the vulnerable Cisco ASA FirePOWER Services or Cisco ASA CX Services device.
- The attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
