Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in bBlog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a lack of CSRF protection in the bBlog weblog software. This means that the application doesn't properly verify if a request originates from a legitimate user session or an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform unintended actions within the bBlog application if a logged-in user visits a malicious page. This could include actions such as modifying data, deleting content or changing settings.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page (or clicking a malicious link) crafted by the attacker. This malicious page will then send forged requests to the bBlog application on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host or distribute a malicious web page or a link to such a page. 
- The attacker needs a logged-in user to be active in the bBlog application.
- The attacker does not need any direct access to the bBlog server, but requires the ability to make the logged-in user execute a request against the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor states the software should not be used in production due to known security issues and that the software is outdated and no longer maintained.
- The CVSS base score is 2.6, which reflects a low severity, with a low attack complexity, no authentication requirements, and only partial impact on integrity.
