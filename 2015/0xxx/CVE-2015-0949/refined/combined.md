## BIOS implementations permit unsafe SMM function calls to memory locations outside of SMRAM

#### Vulnerability Note VU#631788

Original Release Date: 2015-03-20 | Last Revised: 2015-07-08

---

### Overview

Multiple BIOS implementations permit unsafe System Management Mode (SMM) function calls to memory locations outside of SMRAM.

### Description

| Multiple BIOS implementations permit unsafe [System Management Mode (SMM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode) function calls to memory locations outside of SMRAM. According to Corey Kallenberg of LegbaCore:  *System Management Mode (SMM) is the most privileged execution mode on the x86 processor. Non-SMM code can neither read nor write SMRAM (SMM RAM). Hence, even a ring 0 level attacker should be unable to gain access to SMM.However, on modern systems, some SMM code calls or interprets function pointers located outside of SMRAM in an unsafe way. This provides opportunity for a ring 0 level attacker to break into SMM.*In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have access to physical memory. The attacker can gain code execution in the context of SMM by first manipulating a function pointer or function called by SMM and then writing bytes to System Management Interrupt (SMI) command port 0xb2 to trigger SMM. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of SMM and bypass Secure Boot. In systems that do not use protected range registers, an attacker may be able to reflash firmware. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Please see the Vendor Information section below to determine if your system may be affected. We are continuing to communicate with vendors as they investigate these vulnerabilities.Intel has provided the following mitigation guidance for vendors:*Starting in Haswell-based client and server platforms, the "SMM Code Access Check" feature is available in the CPU. If SMM code enables this in the appropriate MSR, then logical processors are prevented from executing SMM code outside the ranges defined by the SMRR. If SMI code jumps outside these ranges, the CPU will assert a machine check exception. During BIOS development, this can be an effective mechanism for BIOS developers to identify insecure call-outs from SMM, and during runtime, this feature can also be effective at blocking certain attacks that redirect SMM execution outside SMRAM.* |

### [Intel Corporation](#BLUU-9RNR26) Not Affected

Notified:  December 10, 2014  Updated: March 02, 2015

**Statement Date:   March 02, 2015**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

This class of vulnerabilities redirects SMM code to execute instructions
outside SMRAM, and we often refer to them as "SMM Call-Out Vulnerabilities".
Intel is not currently aware of SMM call-out vulnerabilities in our supported
products.  In addition, the following mitigation may be relevant to the
discussion of these vulnerabilities.

Starting in Haswell-based client and server platforms, the "SMM Code Access
Check" feature is available in the CPU. If SMM code enables this in the
appropriate MSR, then logical processors are prevented from executing SMM code
outside the ranges defined by the SMRR. If SMI code jumps outside these ranges,
the CPU will assert a machine check exception. During BIOS development, this
can be an effective mechanism for BIOS developers to identify insecure
call-outs from SMM, and during runtime, this feature can also be effective at
blocking certain attacks that redirect SMM execution outside SMRAM.
