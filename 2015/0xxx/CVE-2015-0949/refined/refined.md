Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#631788, which is associated with CVE-2015-0949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is that multiple BIOS implementations allow System Management Mode (SMM) code to execute function calls to memory locations outside of the protected SMRAM (SMM RAM). This occurs because SMM code interprets function pointers that reside outside SMRAM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe SMM Function Calls:** SMM code is making calls to function pointers or functions that are located outside of the secure SMM RAM.
- **Lack of Memory Protection:**  There is no enforcement or check to ensure that function calls from SMM are restricted to within the SMM RAM.
- **Reliance on External Data:** SMM code is relying on function pointers located in memory that can be manipulated by a non-SMM context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local, authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code within the highly privileged SMM context.
- **Secure Boot Bypass:**  The vulnerability can bypass Secure Boot mechanisms, which rely on the integrity of SMM code.
- **Firmware Reflashing:** In systems that do not utilize protected range registers, it could allow an attacker to reflash the firmware potentially corrupting or replacing it with malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Memory Access:** Attackers need access to the system's physical memory to manipulate the function pointers.
- **Ring 0 Access:** Attackers need to be able to execute code at ring 0 or kernel level privileges to perform the exploit.
- **SMI Trigger:** An attacker triggers the execution of the vulnerable SMM code by writing to the System Management Interrupt (SMI) command port (0xb2).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** Attackers need local access to the system.
- **Authentication:** Attackers need to have an authenticated session.
- **Ring 0 privileges:** Attacker needs to have operating system kernel privileges.
- **Physical Memory Access:** The attacker must have the ability to write to physical memory.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating function pointers or functions called by SMM which resides outside of SMRAM.
- Intel's mitigation "SMM Code Access Check", available in Haswell-based platforms, can help prevent such attacks by restricting SMM code execution to within the defined SMRR ranges.
- Several vendors were found to be affected, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo, while others like AMI, IBM, and Intel were found not to be affected.
- The exploit allows for privilege escalation from OS level ring 0 to the highest level of the hardware, SMM.
