Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0277:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2015-0277 as a vulnerability that was fixed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how PicketLink's Service Provider (SP) and Identity Provider (IdP) handle certain requests. Specifically, the Service Provider does not properly validate the `Audience` condition within a SAML assertion. 
- It is also mentioned that the Service Provider does not validate the `Destination` attribute within the SAML Response, which is not directly related to CVE-2015-0277.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Audience Condition Validation**: The PicketLink SP fails to verify if the provided SAML assertion is meant for the SP, specifically when the `AudienceRestriction` is present in the `Conditions` element. This allows assertions targeted at other services to be accepted by the vulnerable SP.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access**: A remote attacker, possessing a valid SAML assertion meant for a different SP, could potentially use the improperly validated assertion to log into the vulnerable SP as a different user. This allows the attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms and gain access to the victim's account.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an attacker.
- **SAML Assertion Replay/Manipulation**: An attacker would need access to a SAML assertion (e.g., by eavesdropping on network traffic or through other means). Once they have a valid SAML assertion from a different user, they would present the SAML assertion to the vulnerable SP.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the capability to obtain a SAML assertion issued by the IdP. This could be done by intercepting a legitimate assertion or through a separate exploit. 
- The attacker has to be able to send a SAML assertion to the vulnerable PicketLink Service Provider.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ondrej Kotek of Red Hat.
*   Red Hat's security advisory (RHSA-2015:0848 and similar) indicates that this flaw affects JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.0 on multiple versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 5, 6 and 7, x86_64, i386 and ppc64 architectures).
*   The resolution for this vulnerability involves upgrading the `picketlink-federation` and associated packages.
*  The patch was applied to `picketlink25` with commits:  `f89de9cc28f73e1f99d27582a64cae0f82430410` and `a449a83438f4d8d52c3c901908aec14233f04a16`
