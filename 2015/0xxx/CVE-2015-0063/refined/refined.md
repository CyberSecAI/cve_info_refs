    "CVE-2015-0063": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Excel improperly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of objects in memory",
        "Parsing of specially crafted files"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system, including installing programs, modifying data, and creating new accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email attack: sending a specially crafted file to a user and convincing them to open it.",
        "Web-based attack: hosting a website (or leveraging a compromised website) with a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability, and convincing users to visit the site and open the file."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Excel file. They also need to convince the user to open the malicious file.",
      "additional_information": "The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Excel parses files. The primary risk is for systems where affected Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers. Servers are also at risk if users are permitted to log on and run programs, which is discouraged by best practices."
