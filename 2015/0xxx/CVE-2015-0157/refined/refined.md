- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted SQL statement with vulnerable scalar functions can cause a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Vulnerable scalar functions within IBM DB2 LUW.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A remote, authenticated DB2 user can cause a DB2 server crash, requiring a restart. This constitutes a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote, authenticated DB2 user can execute a specially-crafted SQL statement.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote, authenticated DB2 user.
