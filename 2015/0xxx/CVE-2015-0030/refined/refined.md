- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, or inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious page, typically by clicking a link in an email or instant message or by opening a malicious attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject malicious content into websites and needs to convince a user to visit the malicious page.
