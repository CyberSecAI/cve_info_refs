  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's ext4 file system when handling the condition 'page size > block size' during fallocate zero range operations.",
      "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in how the ext4 file system handles the zero range functionality of `fallocate` when the page size exceeds the block size. Specifically, block-aligned portions of the range were allocated while non-aligned parts, including edges, were ignored.",
      "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this flaw to crash the system.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access is required for the attack. An attacker needs to be able to execute the `fallocate` system call on a file residing on an ext4 file system.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user on the affected system with the ability to execute system calls. They do not require any special permissions beyond that."
