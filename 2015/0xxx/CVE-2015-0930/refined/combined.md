## SerVision HVG Video Gateway web interface contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#522460

Original Release Date: 2015-02-02 | Last Revised: 2015-02-02

---

### Overview

SerVision HVG Video Gateway web interface contains multiple vulnerabilities affecting multiple firmware versions.

### Description

| [**CWE-288**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html)**: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, and** [**CWE-284**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)**: Improper Access Control** - CVE-2015-0929  By visiting time.htm, a user is issued a cookie that grants administrative privileges in the Servision HVG web interface. There are two distinct impacts of this vulnerability:   1. An unauthenticated user is able to bypass authentication. This is addressed in firmware version 2.2.26a78 and later. 2. An authenticated user is able to elevate privileges. This is reportedly not addressed as of the current release, version 2.2.26a100.  [**CWE-259**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)**: Use of Hard-Coded Password** - CVE-2015-0930SerVision HVG contains a hardcoded password that enables a user to log into the web interface with administrative rights. This is addressed in firmware version 2.2.26a100. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated user may be able to gain administrative privileges on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an upgrade**Users are encouraged to update their firmware to [version 2.2.26a100](http://www.servision.net/downloads/).Those unable to update should consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Appropriate firewall rules which block incoming connections from untrusted networks would likely prevent an external attacker from accessing the device. Note that this does not address the issue of trusted, authenticated users accessing time.htm and gaining elevated privileges. |
