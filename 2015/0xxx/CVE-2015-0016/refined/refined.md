    {
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_54f92fa5_20250125_210620.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows fails to properly sanitize file paths.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of file paths",
        "Directory traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "Elevation of privilege. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker would have to take advantage of an existing vulnerability in Internet Explorer by tricking a user into downloading a specially crafted application.",
        "In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.",
          "Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create a specially crafted application.",
        "Ability to convince a user to download and run the malicious application.",
        "An existing vulnerability in Internet Explorer that allows for code execution."
       ],
      "additional_information": "Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that use this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to gain elevation of privilege. The vulnerability exists in the TS WebProxy Windows component. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows sanitizes file paths. Most likely, this vulnerability would be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit this vulnerability to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user)."

At the moment, this module only bypass Protected Mode on Windows 7 SP1 and prior (32 bits). This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (32 bits) with IE 8 and IE 11."
