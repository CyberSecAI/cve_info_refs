The provided content relates to CVE-2015-0636.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an overloaded Autonomic Networking (AN) message which can reset the finite state machine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software. Specifically, the system does not properly handle overloaded AN messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disrupt access to the autonomic domain from a specific Autonomic Networking (AN) node, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send crafted AN messages that spoof an existing AN node.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send crafted Autonomic Networking (AN) messages to the targeted device.
