Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The IBM InfoSphere Information Server Connector Migration Tool (CMT) uses a deprecated internal API for authentication but does not perform proper authorization checks. This means that while the tool verifies user login credentials, it fails to confirm if the user has the necessary project role (e.g., Developer, Operator) to modify job designs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of authorization checks within the CMT. It relies solely on authentication, allowing users with insufficient privileges to potentially modify jobs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users with limited roles can create, modify, or delete specific types of jobs that they should not have access to. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized changes to critical system jobs.
    - Data corruption or loss.
    - Potential disruption of services relying on these jobs.
    - Security breaches through manipulated jobs

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the IBM InfoSphere Information Server using the Connector Migration Tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with valid login credentials to the InfoSphere Information Server.
- The attacker needs to have a role that is not authorized to modify job designs, but be able to access the Connector Migration Tool

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions 8.1 to 11.3 of IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- A patch (JR51665) is available for the affected versions, except version 8.1 which requires contacting IBM customer support.
- The fix ensures that only users with specific role combinations (SuiteUser + DataStageAdmin, SuiteUser + DataStageDeveloper, or SuiteUser + DataStageProductionManager) can log on to CMT.
