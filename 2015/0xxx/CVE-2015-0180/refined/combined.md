# JR51665: CONNECTOR MIGRATION TOOLKIT DOES NOT CORRECTLY VALIDATE PROJECT ROLE OF USER.

## A fix is available

[IBM InfoSphere Information Server, Version 11.3.1.2 (Fix Pack 2)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/584077)

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  The Connector Migration Toolkit (CMT) uses a deprecated internal
  API that performs Authentication but not Authorization.  Thus it
  will confirm that the user login credentials are valid, but it
  does not then confirm that the project-role of user (i.e.
  Developer, Operator, Super-Operator, etc) is one that is
  authorized to modify job designs.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  APAR Recommendation:
  Apply the patch after reading the security bulletin located
  here:
   <http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697306>

  After applying this patch, the user should not be able to logon
  to CMT unless they have the following role combinations:

  a) SuiteUser + DataStageAdmin
  b) SuiteUser + DataStageDeveloper
  c) SuiteUser + DataStageProductionManager
  Where DataStageDeveloper and DataStageProductionManager are
  PROJECT roles.
