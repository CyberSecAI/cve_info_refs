{
  "CVE-2015-0258": {
    "Description": "Collabtive could be made to run programs if it received specially crafted network traffic from an authenticated user.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from Collabtive's failure to properly validate avatar image file uploads.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper validation of file uploads",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Code execution vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Uploading a specially crafted file as an avatar image via the web interface"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user to upload an avatar image"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted file that, when uploaded, bypasses checks and allows execution of arbitrary code on the server. The original check blacklisted only the 'php' and 'pl' extensions but failed to check for variations such as 'php5', 'phtml', etc.  The fix introduces a check to verify if 'php' is present anywhere in the filename using stristr() function."
