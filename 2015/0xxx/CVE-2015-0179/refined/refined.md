Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Lotus Notes Diagnostic Tool (nsd.exe) runs with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges. This allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is that the diagnostic tool, which should not require such high privileges, runs with SYSTEM level privileges.
- **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The tool allows execution of arbitrary commands via the `LOAD` command, providing a pathway to escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain SYSTEM level access to the local machine.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute any command as SYSTEM, allowing full control of the machine.
- **Process Manipulation:** The tool can be used to attach to and kill processes, and create memory dumps, all under the SYSTEM context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** The attack is performed by interacting with the `nsd.exe` tool using its CLI mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the local machine where Lotus Notes Diagnostic Tool is installed.
- They must be able to interact with the command line interface of the `nsd.exe` tool.

**Summary:**
CVE-2015-0179 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Lotus Notes Diagnostic Tool. By leveraging the fact that `nsd.exe` runs as SYSTEM, an attacker can use the `LOAD` command to execute any arbitrary command under SYSTEM context, resulting in full control of the targeted machine.

This vulnerability has been fixed in Lotus Notes 9.0.1 FP3 and 8.5.3 FP6.
