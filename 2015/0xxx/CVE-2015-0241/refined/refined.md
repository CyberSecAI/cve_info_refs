Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-0241:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `to_char()` function of PostgreSQL. This function is used for converting data types into formatted strings based on a template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Buffer Overrun:** When processing numeric formatting templates with a large number of digits, the `to_char()` function would read past the end of a buffer. Similarly, when processing crafted timestamp formatting templates, the function would write past the end of a buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Server Crash:** The most immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the PostgreSQL server.
-   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The provided documents mention that while unlikely, they haven't ruled out the possibility of privilege escalation due to this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a database user through the `to_char()` SQL function with specific formatting templates, especially numeric or timestamp-related ones that involve a large number of digits or are crafted in a malicious manner.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Authenticated Database User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PostgreSQL database.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as an "out of boundaries read/write" issue, leading to a server crash.
- The root cause is in the buffer handling of the `to_char()` function when it processes a template.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of PostgreSQL (9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4), and fixed in subsequent point releases
-  The fix involves correcting the buffer handling within the `to_char()` function to prevent overruns
