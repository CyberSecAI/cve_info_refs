Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0065:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files, specifically within the "OneTableDocumentStream" data section. This leads to an invalid read dereference of a bad object pointer and subsequent memory corruption, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Invalid memory access:** The core issue is an invalid read operation due to a bad object pointer within the OneTableDocumentStream's data section, which is then copied into a stack buffer.
- **Controlled value used as indirect call target:** If the read word value is controlled and set to a value other than 0xFFFF, this controlled value is used as an indirect call target.
- **Incorrect file parsing:**  The vulnerability arises due to incorrect parsing of a specially crafted document, leading to memory corruption when handling the OneTableDocumentStream.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **System compromise:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains complete control of the system, enabling them to install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email attack:** An attacker sends a specially crafted file to a user and convinces them to open it.
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a website (or uses a compromised website) that contains a specially crafted file, tricking the user into visiting the site and opening the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Word document.
- Ability to deliver this file to a target user through email or web access, and persuade them to open it.
-  No special position is needed.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The crash occurs due to an invalid read dereference.
- The vulnerability lies in the `OneTableDocumentStream` data section.
- The bad object pointer is passed from `wwlib.dll` to `MSO.dll`.
- The copy operation at `3126A36C` (in `wwlib.dll`) copies data from the `OneTableDocumentStream`'s data section into a stack buffer.
- The affected bits are in the `OneTableDocumentStream` data section, `PlcfSed`'s `aCP[0]` field, and `PNFKPPAPX[44]`'s `pn` field.
