Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver dereferencing a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel-mode driver dereferences a NULL pointer.
- The NULL page, which is not typically allocated or mapped, is dereferenced.
- This can lead to a blue-screen condition unless the NULL page is mapped.
- If the NULL page is mapped, an attacker can copy kernel information into the NULL page and read its contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Information Disclosure: An attacker can gain information about the system by reading the contents of the NULL page, which contains kernel information.
-  This information can be used in conjunction with other attacks to compromise the system and bypass security features like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
- The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to map the NULL page to a memory region they can control
- Trigger the vulnerable code to dereference the NULL pointer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to map the NULL page to a user-controlled address space to read the copied kernel information.
- The vulnerability is more easily exploited when NULL page mapping is enabled, although this is not the default state in Windows 8 and later.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by changing how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- The document notes that Microsoft had not received any information that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" for Denial of Service on Windows 8, 8.1, Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and Windows RT systems.
- The primary impact of this vulnerability, as described, is information disclosure and using that for bypassing ASLR.
