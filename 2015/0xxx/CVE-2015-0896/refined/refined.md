Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the presence of multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the eXtplorer web-based file manager. Specifically, one XSS vulnerability is found within the file list and another within the SWFUpload component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist.
    - One XSS vulnerability within the file list.
    - One XSS vulnerability in the SWFUpload component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This can lead to various impacts including:
- Stealing of cookies or session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking
- Defacement of the web page
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (remote). An attacker can inject malicious script into the application, which will then be executed by the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to inject malicious script into the application, likely through file uploads or some other form of input to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided documents mention a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 which is considered a "Medium" severity.
- The vulnerabilities are fixed in eXtplorer version 2.1.7 and later.
