## Vulnerability Information

## Malformed PNG Parsing Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0080

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows fails to properly handle uninitialized memory when parsing certain, specially crafted [PNG](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) image format files. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker convinces a user to visit a website that contains specially crafted PNG images.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially crafted website (or leverage a compromised website or one that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convince a user to visit the website. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit a website. A user would have to be convinced to do so, typically by way of a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that directs the user to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content through banner advertisements or other methods capable of delivering web content to affected systems.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read data which was not intended to be disclosed. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows processes PNG image format files.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
