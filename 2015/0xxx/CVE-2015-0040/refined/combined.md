## Security Update for Internet Explorer (3034682)

Published: February 10, 2015 | Updated: March 4, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and forty privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer, by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature, and by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3034682](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3034682).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0054](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0054) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0055](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0055) | No | No |

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. The vulnerabilities would have to be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit any of these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerabilities

Security feature bypass vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could bypass the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use a ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0051](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0051) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2015-0069](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0069) | No | No |

## Internet Explorer Cross-domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0070

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, which could allow an attacker to gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.

Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause MSIE 11 to interrupt the handling of one readystatechange event with another. This interrupts a call to one of the various C<Element­Name>Element::Notify functions to make another such call and at least one of these functions is non-reentrant. This can have various repercussions, e.g. when an attacker triggers this vulnerability using a CMap­Element object, a reference to that object can be stored in a linked list and the object itself can be freed. This pointer can later be re-used to cause a classic use-after-free issue.

Known affected versions, attack vectors and mitigations

Microsoft Internet Explorer 11

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Java­Script should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description

When a Document­Fragment containing an applet element is added to the DOM, all elements receive a notification that they are removed from the CMarkup. Next, they are added to the DOM and receive notification of being added to another CMarkup. When the applet is added, a CObject­Element is created and added to the CMarkup. This causes a readystatechange event to fire, which interrupts the current code. During this readystatechange event, the DOM may be modified, which causes further notifications to fire. However, elements in the Document­Fragment that come after the applet element have already received a notification that they have been remove from one CMarkup, but not that they have been added to the new one. Thus, these elements may receive another notification of removal, followed by two notifications of being added to a CMarkup.

AFAICT, this event-within-an-event itself is the root cause of the bug and allows memory corruption in various ways. I discovered the issue because the code in CMap­Element::Notify does not handle this sequence of events well. The below pseudo-code represents that function and shows how this can lead to memory corruption:

void MSHTML!CMap­Element::Notify(CNotification* p­Notification) {
  CElement::Notify(p­Arg1);

  if (p­Notification->dw­Code_00 == 17) { // add
    CMarkup* p­Markup = this->CElement::Get­Markup();
    this->p­Next­Map­Element_38 = p­Markup->Get­Map­Head();
    p­Markup->CMarkup::Set­Map­Head(this);
  } else if (p­Notification->dw­Code_00 == 18) { // remove
    CMarkup* p­Markup = this->CElement::Get­Markup();
    CDoc p­Doc = p­Markup->CMarkup::Get­Lookaside­Ptr(4);
    CMap­Element** pp­Map­Element = &(p­Doc->p­Map­Element_08);
    while(*pp­Map­Element) {
      if (*pp­Map­Element == this) {
        *pp­Map­Element = this->p­Map­Element_38;
        break;
      }
      pp­Map­Element = &(*pp­Map­Element->p­Map­Element_38);
    }
  }
}

This code maintains a singly linked list of map elements that have been added to the document. An object should never be added to this list twice, as this will cause a loop in the list (a map element pointing to itself as the next in the list). However, the event-within-an-event can be used to first cause two consecutive calls to remove the same element from this list followed by two calls to add the same element to the list. This results in the following sequence of events:

The first call to remove the element will remove it from the list.
The second call to remove the element will do nothing.
The first call to add the element will add it to the list.
The second call to add the element will try to add it to the list again, causing the list to contain a loop. This list is now corrupt.

At this point, an attacker can remove the CMap­Element, causing the code to try to remove it from the list and free it. However, because of the loop in the list, the above code will not actually remove it from the list. After this, the pointer in the list points to freed memory.

Exploit

I focused on the CMap­Element::Notify code and was able to reuse the freed memory originally used for the CMap­Element with another object of similar size (eg. a CParam­Element, which may be extra useful as it will store a pointer to its parent CObject­Element at offset 38). However, I could not think of a way to use the CMap­Element::Notify code to do anything useful at that point. I could also not immediately find any other code that uses this linked list, which is a bit odd: why would MSIE keep a linked list and not use it? I suspect there must be other code that uses it, and that this code may allow exploitation of this vulnerability.

Aside from the use-after-free bug that exists for CMap­Element objects above, there may be many other issues for other types of objects, as there are many different C<Elenent­Name>Element::Notify implementations for the various elements. It is assumes that none of these were designed to be reentrant. Unfortunately, I did not have time to exhaustively reverse engineer their code to look for other code paths that might be exploitable. As a result I am unable to prove exploitability beyond reasonable doubt.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## In this article

## Security Update for Internet Explorer (3034682)

Published: February 10, 2015 | Updated: March 4, 2015

**Version:** 1.1

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and forty privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer, by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature, and by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3034682](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3034682).

## Affected Software

The following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.

These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. The vulnerabilities would have to be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allowed remote code execution. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit any of these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for these vulnerabilities.

## Multiple Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerabilities

Security feature bypass vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer does not use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could bypass the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use a ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.

## Internet Explorer Cross-domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0070

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce cross-domain policies, which could allow an attacker to gain access to information in another domain or Internet Explorer zone. The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that cross-domain policies are properly enforced in Internet Explorer.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

MSIE 11 MSHTML CMap­Element::Notify use-after-free

![](/Images/Vuln.svg "Vuln")![](/Images/Microsoft Internet Explorer.svg "Microsoft Internet Explorer")

# Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 MSHTML CMap­Element::Notify use-after-free

([MS15-009](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-009), [CVE-2015-0040](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0040))

## Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause MSIE 11 to interrupt the handling of one
`readystatechange` event with another. This interrupts a call to one of the
various `C<Element­Name>Element::Notify` functions to make another such call and
at least one of these functions is [non-reentrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_%28computing%29). This can have various
repercussions, e.g. when an attacker triggers this vulnerability using a
`CMap­Element` object, a reference to that object can be stored in a linked list
and the object itself can be freed. This pointer can later be re-used to cause
a classic use-after-free issue.

## Known affected versions, attack vectors and mitigations

* **Microsoft Internet Explorer 11**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  web-page. Disabling Java­Script should prevent an attacker from triggering
  the vulnerable code path.

## Description

When a `Document­Fragment` containing an applet element is added to the DOM, all
elements receive a notification that they are removed from the `CMarkup`.
Next, they are added to the DOM and receive notification of being added to
another `CMarkup`. When the applet is added, a `CObject­Element` is created and
added to the `CMarkup`. This causes a `readystatechange` event to fire, which
interrupts the current code. During this `readystatechange` event, the DOM may
be modified, which causes further notifications to fire. However, elements in
the `Document­Fragment` that come after the applet element have already received
a notification that they have been remove from one `CMarkup`, but not that they
have been added to the new one. Thus, these elements may receive another
notification of removal, followed by two notifications of being added to a
`CMarkup`.

AFAICT, this event-within-an-event itself is the root cause of the bug and
allows memory corruption in various ways. I discovered the issue because the
code in `CMap­Element::Notify` does not handle this sequence of events well.
The below pseudo-code represents that function and shows how this can lead to
memory corruption:

void MSHTML!CMap­Element::Notify(CNotification\* p­Notification) {
CElement::Notify(p­Arg1);
if (p­Notification->dw­Code\_00 == 17) { // add
CMarkup\* p­Markup = this->CElement::Get­Markup();
this->p­Next­Map­Element\_38 = p­Markup->Get­Map­Head();
p­Markup->CMarkup::Set­Map­Head(this);
} else if (p­Notification->dw­Code\_00 == 18) { // remove
CMarkup\* p­Markup = this->CElement::Get­Markup();
CDoc p­Doc = p­Markup->CMarkup::Get­Lookaside­Ptr(4);
CMap­Element\*\* pp­Map­Element = &(p­Doc->p­Map­Element\_08);
while(\*pp­Map­Element) {
if (\*pp­Map­Element == this) {
\*pp­Map­Element = this->p­Map­Element\_38;
break;
}
pp­Map­Element = &(\*pp­Map­Element->p­Map­Element\_38);
}
}
}

This code maintains a singly linked list of map elements that have been added
to the document. An object should never be added to this list twice, as this
will cause a loop in the list (a map element pointing to itself as the next in
the list). However, the event-within-an-event can be used to first cause two
consecutive calls to remove the same element from this list followed by two
calls to add the same element to the list. This results in the following
sequence of events:

* The first call to remove the element will remove it from the list.
* The second call to remove the element will do nothing.
* The first call to add the element will add it to the list.
* The second call to add the element will try to add it to the list again,
  causing the list to contain a loop. This list is now corrupt.

At this point, an attacker can remove the `CMap­Element`, causing the code to
try to remove it from the list and free it. However, because of the loop in the
list, the above code will not actually remove it from the list. After this,
the pointer in the list points to freed memory.

## Exploit

I focused on the `CMap­Element::Notify` code and was able to reuse the freed
memory originally used for the `CMap­Element` with another object of similar
size (eg. a `CParam­Element`, which may be extra useful as it will store a
pointer to its parent `CObject­Element` at offset 38). However, I could not
think of a way to use the `CMap­Element::Notify` code to do anything useful at
that point. I could also not immediately find any other code that uses this
linked list, which is a bit odd: why would MSIE keep a linked list and not use
it? I suspect there must be other code that uses it, and that this code may
allow exploitation of this vulnerability.

Aside from the use-after-free bug that exists for `CMap­Element` objects above,
there may be many other issues for other types of objects, as there are many
different `C<Elenent­Name>Element::Notify` implementations for the various
elements. It is assumes that none of these were designed to be [reentrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_%28computing%29).
Unfortunately, I did not have time to exhaustively reverse engineer their code
to look for other code paths that might be exploitable. As a result I am unable
to prove exploitability beyond reasonable doubt.
