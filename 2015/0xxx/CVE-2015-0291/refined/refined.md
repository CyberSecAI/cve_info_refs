{
  "CVE-2015-0291": {
    "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the sigalgs implementation within OpenSSL's t1_lib.c.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a malformed ClientHello message during renegotiation, leading to a daemon crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted ClientHello message during renegotiation containing an invalid signature_algorithms extension."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to an OpenSSL server vulnerable to this flaw.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2a. The issue involves how OpenSSL handles renegotiation requests with an invalid Signature Algorithms extension. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted ClientHello message to trigger the NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2a."
