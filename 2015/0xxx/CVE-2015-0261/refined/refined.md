  "CVE-2015-0261": {
    "description": "Integer signedness error in the mobility_opt_print function in the IPv6 mobility printer in tcpdump before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative length value.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a typecasting/signedness issue within the `mobility_opt_print` function, introduced by a change from `int` to `unsigned int` for handling length values. This causes a negative length value to be interpreted as a very large positive one leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer signedness error",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly achieve arbitrary code execution.",

    "description": "The rpki_rtr_pdu_print function in print-rpki-rtr.c in the TCP printer in tcpdump before 4.7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) via a crafted header length in an RPKI-RTR Protocol Data Unit (PDU).",
     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a missing length check in the `rpki_rtr_pdu_print()` function in `print-rpki-rtr.c`. The function operates on RPKI-RTR PDUs with a header length, and a lack of validation allows the function to attempt to read data beyond the buffer boundaries leading to crashes and potentially code execution",

     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of sufficient sanity checks in the `osi_print_cksum` function within the ethernet printer when processing checksum values.

     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the force printer within tcpdump, where improper handling of data allows a remote attacker to cause a crash or potentially execute code.
