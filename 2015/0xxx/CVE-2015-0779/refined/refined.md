  "cveId": "CVE-2015-0779",
  "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in UploadServlet in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM) 10 and 11 before 11.3.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted directory name in the uid parameter, in conjunction with a WAR filename in the filename parameter and WAR content in the POST data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-5323 and CVE-2010-5324.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The UploadServlet in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM) does not properly sanitize the `uid` parameter, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
       "Unrestricted File Upload"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can upload a malicious WAR file to a location within the web application's directory tree, which can lead to code execution on the server.",
    "attackVectors": "The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `UploadServlet`. An attacker crafts a malicious request, including directory traversal characters in the `uid` parameter along with a malicious WAR file.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication or special privileges but needs to send crafted HTTP POST requests.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability can be exploited on Windows, Linux, and the Virtual Appliance of Novell ZCM. The vulnerability is similar to ZDI-10-078 / OSVDB-63412, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet. The vulnerability is fixed in version 11.3.2, but for 11.3.1 and 11.3.1 FRU1, users need to contact Novell Technical Support for a fix."
