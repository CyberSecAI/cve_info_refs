  "CVE-2015-0292": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An integer underflow flaw exists in the way OpenSSL decodes malformed Base64-encoded inputs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer underflow leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded input (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to crash or potentially achieve code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted base64 data, such as a PEM file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to make an application using OpenSSL to decode the crafted base64 data."
