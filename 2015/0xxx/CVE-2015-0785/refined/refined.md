Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to sanitize the "dirname" variable within the `com.novell.zenworks.inventory.rtr.actionclasses.wcreports` component of Novell Zenworks. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to manipulate the path, leading to unauthorized file disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. By manipulating the "dirname" variable, an attacker can specify arbitrary paths to be accessed, potentially disclosing sensitive files and directories.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (the "dirname" variable), making it susceptible to path manipulation attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose the contents of folders on the system where the vulnerable software is installed. This could include sensitive configuration files, system information, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is network accessible, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
- **Direct Request Manipulation:** The attacker would need to manipulate the request that contains the vulnerable "dirname" variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable service. No prior authentication or local access is required.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable component:** The attacker needs to know the specific path of the vulnerable `com.novell.zenworks.inventory.rtr.actionclasses.wcreports` class and how to manipulate the "dirname" parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `com.novell.zenworks.inventory.rtr.actionclasses.wcreports` component of Novell Zenworks.
- User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Novell has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
