Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0158:

**CVE-2015-0158**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Coach NG framework improperly handles user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input within the BPM Coach NG framework. Specifically, detailed error messages containing unescaped user input are generated.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A remote attacker could craft a malicious URL.
    *   If a user clicks the crafted URL, the attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser.
    *   The script execution takes place within the security context of the hosting website, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials or perform other malicious actions.
    *   The primary impact is unauthorized script execution in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL.
    *   An attacker needs to entice a user to click on this malicious link.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that exploits the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker must persuade the targeted user to click on the malicious URL.
    *   The attacker can be remote and does not need any specific access to the server itself.
    *   The vulnerability is client-side, triggered by user interaction.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced V8.0.x and 8.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Standard V8.0.x and 8.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Express V8.0.x and 8.5.x

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves replacing detailed error messages with generic ones, thus preventing the inclusion of unescaped user input.
*   Fixes are available for multiple versions of IBM BPM, with specific APAR numbers, but are sometimes superseded by other cumulative fixes (e.g., JR52322, JR52137).
*   A workaround involves advising users not to click on links in emails, which is a basic precaution.
*   The vulnerability is resolved by applying the appropriate interim fix for the relevant APARs (JR52355, JR52322, JR52137).
*   The fix for version 8.5.0.1 has been superseded by JR52322, and the fix for version 8.5.5.0 has been superseded by JR52137.
