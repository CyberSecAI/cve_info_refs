- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw exists in the DER parser used by Suricata to decode SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper handling of DER encoded data when parsing SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause Suricata to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted SSL/TLS certificates to a Suricata instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a Suricata instance that includes a crafted SSL/TLS certificate.
