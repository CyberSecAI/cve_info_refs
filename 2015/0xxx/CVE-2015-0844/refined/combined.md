Wesnoth 1.12.2 is out!

[![Screenshot](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-7-192.jpg)](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-7.jpg "Click for full size version") [![Screenshot](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-12-192.jpg)](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-12.jpg "Click for full size version") [![Screenshot](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-8-192.jpg)](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-8.jpg "Click for full size version") [![Screenshot](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-199-192.jpg)](//www.wesnoth.org/images/sshots/wesnoth-1.12.0-199.jpg "Click for full size version")

This is a maintenance release for the stable 1.12.x series, and it is fully compatible with version 1.12.0. This version includes a critical security fix, as well as an assortment of other bug fixes, minor improvements in various areas, and translation updates.

Because this release solves a known security vulnerability affecting the game client, **we urge users of all previous versions to upgrade immediately**.

Read on for more details about the most notable fixes in this release, as well as a few known bugs we hope will be fixed in future releases. Players coming from 1.10.x or previous stable versions should check our official [release notes](http://www.wesnoth.org/start/1.12/) for Wesnoth 1.12 to learn about the new features and general improvements from this series.

[ Expand all ]

Security vulnerability fix (CVE-2015-0844)»A severe bug was found in the game client that could allow a malicious user to obtain personal files and information from players in networked MP games through the WML/Lua API (bug #23440). This issue affects all platforms.

**Users of all existing Wesnoth releases are urged to upgrade immediately.**

CVE-2015-0844 has been assigned to this vulnerability and may provide further information.
Multiplayer campaign gold carryover fix»Bug [#22936 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?22936) has now been fixed, meaning that clients should get the correct gold carryover when they play multiplayer campaigns together.

**This bug was client-side, and old clients (1.12.0, 1.12.1) cannot be fixed!** All clients in a multiplayer campaign must have version 1.12.2 or later, or OOS errors will occur.

If you are producing an MP campaign, you can help mitigate the problem by warning users against playing older versions with it, using WML code like the following in your scenario:

Code: Select all

```
#ifver WESNOTH_VERSION < 1.12.2
    [message]
        speaker=narrator
        message= _ "You have an outdated Wesnoth version which is affected by a gold carryover bug — you will get OOS errors when the campaign transitions between scenarios, and you will have to save and reload each time to proceed. Please consider upgrading Wesnoth to version 1.12.2 or later."
    [/message]
#endif

```

Refer to [PreprocessorRef](//wiki.wesnoth.org/PreprocessorRef) on the wiki for further information on using the [`#ifver`](//wiki.wesnoth.org/PreprocessorRef#.23ifver_and_.23ifnver) directive.
Multiplayer carryover fix for randomly-generated maps»An issue (bug [#23454 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23454)) with variables and other state not being transferred correctly when transitioning to a randomly-generated map scenario was fixed.
Multiplayer event synchronization fix»WML `time over` events were previously not synchronized (bug [#23331 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23331)). This means if you do any of the following things in such an event handler in a game with at least one client with a version earlier than 1.12.2, you will get OOS errors:

* Using `[set_variable] rand=`
* Creating units (`[unit]`, `[unstore_unit]`, `wesnoth.put_unit`, etc.)
* Displaying a `[message]` requiring user input (`[option]`, `[text_input]`)
* Using `[get_global_variable]`
* Calling `wesnoth.synchronize_choice`

Miscellaneous fixes and improvements»

* The campaigns *A Tale of Two Brothers*, *Delfador’s Memoirs*, *The Hammer of Thursagan*, *Northern Rebirth*, and the epilogue of *Legend of Wesmere* now make use of the new story maps introduced in 1.11.x.
* Enemy reinforcements are now summoned as intended in *Under the Burning Suns* scenario 5 “A Subterranean Struggle”.
* Undoing player actions after deactivating Delayed Shroud Updates should no longer generate OOS errors.
* Clicking during the execution of `[delay]` actions in prestart no longer results in a segmentation fault (bug [#23243 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23243)).
* The Terrain Description context menu option can no longer be used to reveal shrouded terrain (bug [#23426 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23426)).
* Sliders in certain parts of the game interface (using the GUI1 framework) now process input focus correctly, allowing to adjust them using arrow keys ([#22984 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?22984)).
* Several issues with specific Micro AI engines have been fixed. See [this post](http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?p=578365#p578365) for details.

Known bugs»**General bugs:**

* HP/XP bars of allied units are drawn over shroud with some side configurations (bug [#23460 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23460)).
* Wesnoth may occasionally crash to desktop when/while music is enabled. Thus far, this has been observed on Windows XP SP3 (bugs [#23203 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23203) and [#23026 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?23026)) and Debian GNU/Linux 8 “jessie” (report pending).

  **More information is needed to help us determine the cause of this issue** — in particular, your Wesnoth build configuration (if compiling from source), and OS and library versions, as well as any customizations you may have made to your install. Backtraces and semi-reliable steps to reproduce are highly desirable due to the nature of this bug.
* It’s not possible to clear some default hotkeys with the Clear Hotkey option (bug [#21983 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?21983)). This will not be fixed in 1.12.x.
* Attempting to assign hotkeys including both the Ctrl and Alt modifiers does not work (bug [#22219 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?22219)).

**Bugs specific to Microsoft Windows:**

* ClearType font rendering is disabled as it causes glitches (bug [#21648 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?21648)).

  This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process.
* Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [#21649 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?21649)).

  This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.

**Bugs specific to Apple OS X:**

The following issues affecting Wesnoth on Apple OS X are known and they are pending fixes. However, many of them are beyond the scope of the 1.12.x series and require significant re-engineering that can only be done in 1.13.x development releases later, or cannot be properly addressed due to a lack of experienced OS X coders in our team. Thus, unless someone can contribute patches to address them, it is unlikely that these bugs will be fixed during the 1.12.x series.

* Color cursors are forcibly disabled on this platform due to severe performance issues (bug [#18112 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?18112)).
* Fullscreen mode does not fill the entire screen when maximum resolution is selected in Preferences → Display, and user interface elements are scaled and distorted.
* System commands do not work while Wesnoth is running in fullscreen mode (bug [#21943 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?21943)).
* The mouse cursor is not mapped correctly to the game screen contents on Retina displays due to problems with detected vs. real screen resolution mismatches (bug [#20332 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?20332)).

  A workaround is in place making Wesnoth default to 800x600 on OS X regardless of the incorrectly-detected maximum resolution.
* Trackpad tap clicking is sometimes not recognized ([forum post](http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=39788)).
* Unofficial builds with OpenMP support enabled randomly freeze (bug [#18144 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?18144)).
* Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [#21649 [Gna.org]](https://gna.org/bugs/?21649)).

  This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.

There are a few more changes in addition to the aforementioned, including translation updates and minor bug fixes. Most of these items are listed in the [full changelog](https://raw.github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/1.12.2/changelog) for enthusiasts and content creators. An alternative [players changelog](https://raw.github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/1.12.2/players_changelog) is also available, including only items deemed relevant for regular players.

Package        : wesnoth-1.10
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-0844

Ignacio R. Morelle discovered that missing path restrictions in the
"Battle of Wesnoth" game could result in the disclosure of arbitrary
files in the user's home directory if malicious campaigns/maps are
loaded.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.3-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.10.7-2 and in version 1:1.12.1-1 of the wesnoth-1.12
source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth-1.10 packages.
