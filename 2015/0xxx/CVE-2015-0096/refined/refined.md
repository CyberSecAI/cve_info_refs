Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2015-0096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Windows improperly handles the loading of DLL files when parsing shortcuts. Specifically, when the icon of a specially crafted shortcut is displayed, a malicious DLL could be loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper DLL loading: Windows does not properly validate the DLL files loaded when rendering shortcut icons.
- Lack of proper input validation: The system fails to validate the source of the DLL files, allowing malicious ones to be loaded when a shortcut icon is displayed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can gain complete control of the affected system.
- Full system compromise: Attackers can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Privilege escalation: Users with fewer rights on the system are less impacted, implying potential privilege escalation for less privileged users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Browsing a malicious website: An attacker can host the malicious shortcut and DLL file on a website, and when a user browses to it with Windows Explorer the vulnerability is triggered.
- Accessing a remote network share: Similarly, a network share containing the malicious shortcut and DLL file can trigger the vulnerability upon access with Windows Explorer.
- Browsing a local working directory: Accessing a local directory containing the malicious shortcut and DLL via Windows Explorer can trigger the vulnerability.
- USB Removable Drives: The vulnerability can be exploited through USB drives, particularly with AutoPlay enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or place a specially crafted shortcut file and a corresponding malicious DLL file within a location that the target user will browse with Windows Explorer.
- The attacker does not require user interaction beyond convincing the user to browse a directory.

**Additional notes:**
- Browsing via methods such as cmd.exe or powershell.exe does not trigger the exploit.
- The vulnerability is triggered when Windows Explorer attempts to display the icon of the specially crafted shortcut.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Microsoft Windows handles the loading of DLL files.
- Workarounds exist that can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling icon display for shortcuts or disabling the WebClient service.
