- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element. The application loads DLLs from a predictable location without verifying their integrity or origin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not validate the DLL before loading, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution at the privilege level of the application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with administrative access to the default installation directory can place a malicious DLL. The exploit is triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application, loading the malicious DLL. Social engineering may be required to convince the user to load the malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative access to the default install location to plant the malicious DLL. Some level of social engineering may be needed to trick a user into running the vulnerable application and loading the malicious file.
