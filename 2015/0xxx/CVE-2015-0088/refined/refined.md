- **Attack vectors**:
    - Viewing a specially crafted file (e.g., document with a malicious embedded font).
    - Visiting a website hosting a specially crafted web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.
    - Opening a malicious attachment sent via email
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious font file or link to a malicious website to the targeted user. This can be achieved via email, instant messaging, or hosting the content on a compromised website.
    - No special privileges or access is required on the victim's machine, the vulnerability can be exploited by the targeted user.
