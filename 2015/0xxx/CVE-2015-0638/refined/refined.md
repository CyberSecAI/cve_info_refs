    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process malicious ICMPv4 messages received on a VRF-enabled interface. When a malicious ICMP message enters the packet queue of the affected interface, it may fail to be properly processed or may not be cleared from the input queue, resulting in a queue wedge.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of ICMPv4 messages",
        "Failure to clear packet queues"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The affected device will stop processing any additional packets received on the wedged interface.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote. An attacker sends specially crafted ICMPv4 messages to a VRF-enabled interface on a Cisco IOS device.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send ICMPv4 messages to a vulnerable interface. No authentication is required."
