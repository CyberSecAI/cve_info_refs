"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability within the virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) subsystem of Cisco IOS software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process malicious ICMP version 4 (ICMPv4) messages received on a VRF-enabled interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting ICMPv4 messages designed to trigger the vulnerability on an affected device. When the ICMPv4 messages are processed, the packet queue of the affected interface may not be cleared, leading to a queue wedge. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets received on the wedged interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The March 25, 2015, Cisco IOS & XE Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Cisco Security Advisories. The advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS & XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_mar15.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_mar15.html\"]\r\n\r\n"

"text": "Only devices with specific configurations are affected. Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions are vulnerable when one or more interfaces are assigned to a VRF interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether an interface on a device is enabled for VRF, use the show vrf command-line interface exec CLI command. If the device is not configured for VRF, there will be no output to indicate that VRF is enabled. In the following example, VRF is not enabled on any interface:\n\r\nRouter#show vrf\n\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the device is configured for VRF, the output will indicate that VRF is enabled and identify the device interfaces on which it has been enabled as shown in the following example:\n\r\nRouter#show vrf\n\r\n Name\t\tDefault RD\t\tProtocols\t\tInterfaces\r\n VRF-01\t\t\tipv4\t\t Gi0/0\r\n\r\nIf the preceding output is returned, but no interfaces are assigned, VRF may be configured but is not enabled on an interface. This output in this situation is shown in the following example:\n\r\nRouter#show vrf\n\r\n Name\t\tDefault RD\t\tProtocols\t\tInterfaces\r\n VRF-01\t\t\tipv4\r\n\r\nOnly IPv4 traffic directed to the device will trigger the vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod\_rel\_team\r\n!--- output truncated\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n"

"text": "Devices running Cisco IOS and configured to perform virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) are affected by a vulnerability that may be triggered during the processing of ICMP version 4 (ICMPv4) messages destined for the interface enabled for VRF. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process malicious ICMPv4 messages received on a VRF-enabled interface. When a malicious ICMP message enters the packet queue of the affected interface, it may fail to be properly processed or may not be cleared from the input queue, resulting in a queue wedge. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets received on the wedged interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nQueue wedges occur when certain packets are received and queued by a Cisco IOS router or switch but, due to a processing error, are never removed from the queue. Consult the \"Workarounds\" section of this advisory for more information about queue wedges and some detection mechanisms that may be used to identify a blocked interface in Cisco IOS Software. Also see the Cisco Security Blog Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained[\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco\_ios\_queue\_wedges\_explained/\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nICMP for IP version 4 (IPv4) messages transiting the device will not trigger this vulnerability; only packets terminating on an affected device can trigger the vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsi02145[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsi02145\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0638."

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but the following identification mechanisms exist for this vulnerability:\n\r\n\n\r\nEmbedded Event Manager\n\r\n\n\r\nA Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS device and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download at the \"Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community\" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337[\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nFor additional information, see the Cisco Security Blog Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained[\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco\_ios\_queue\_wedges\_explained/\"]."

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsOnly devices with specific configurations are affected. Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software versions are vulnerable when one or more interfaces are assigned to a VRF interface.      To determine whether an interface on a device is enabled for VRF, use the **show vrf** command-line interface exec CLI command. If the device is not configured for VRF, there will be no output to indicate that VRF is enabled. In the following example, VRF is not enabled on any interface:   ```   Router#show vrf   Router#      ```      If the device is configured for VRF, the output will indicate that VRF is enabled and identify the device interfaces on which it has been enabled as shown in the following example:   ```   Router#show vrf     Name		Default RD		Protocols		Interfaces     VRF-01			ipv4		        Gi0/0      ```   If the preceding output is returned, but no interfaces are assigned, VRF may be configured but is not enabled on an interface. This output in this situation is shown in the following example:   ```   Router#show vrf     Name		Default RD		Protocols		Interfaces     VRF-01			ipv4      ```   Only IPv4 traffic directed to the device will trigger the vulnerability.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software.

Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS-XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco NX-OS Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Devices running Cisco IOS and configured to perform virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) are affected by a vulnerability that may be triggered during the processing of ICMP version 4 (ICMPv4) messages destined for the interface enabled for VRF. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly process malicious ICMPv4 messages received on a VRF-enabled interface. When a malicious ICMP message enters the packet queue of the affected interface, it may fail to be properly processed or may not be cleared from the input queue, resulting in a queue wedge. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets received on the wedged interface.      Queue wedges occur when certain packets are received and queued by a Cisco IOS router or switch but, due to a processing error, are never removed from the queue. Consult the "Workarounds" section of this advisory for more information about queue wedges and some detection mechanisms that may be used to identify a blocked interface in Cisco IOS Software. Also see the Cisco Security Blog [Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/).      ICMP for IP version 4 (IPv4) messages transiting the device will not trigger this vulnerability; only packets terminating on an affected device can trigger the vulnerability.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCsi02145](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsi02145) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0638.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but the following identification mechanisms exist for this vulnerability:      **Embedded Event Manager**      A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS device and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.      The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: <https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337>      For additional information, see the Cisco Security Blog [Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/).  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Alerts archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.         Cisco IOS Software Cisco provides a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication The tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
