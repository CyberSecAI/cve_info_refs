# Honeywell XL Web Controller Directory Traversal Vulnerability

Last RevisedAugust 27, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-076-02

## OVERVIEW

Martin Jartelius of Outpost24 has identified a directory traversal vulnerability in Honeywell’s XL Web Controller. Honeywell has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following XLWeb controller versions are affected:

* XL1000C50          EXCEL WEB 52 I/O,
* XL1000C100        EXCEL WEB 104 I/O,
* XL1000C500        EXCEL WEB 300 I/O,

* XL1000C500U      EXCEL WEB 300 I/O UUKL, and
* XL1000C1000U    EXCEL WEB 600 I/O UUKL.

## IMPACT

An attacker may use this vulnerability to generate a valid login for an administrative user on the Honeywell XLWeb controller giving the attacker full administrator access to the system. The XLWEB application effectively becomes an entry point into the network where it is located.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Honeywell is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide.

The affected products, XLWeb controllers, are web-based SCADA systems. According to Honeywell, XLWeb controllers are deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems, and others. Honeywell estimates that these products are used primarily in Europe and the Middle East.

Linux: <https://www.centraline.com/index.php?id=847&route=article/index&directory_id=140&direct_link=1>

CARE: [https://www.centraline.com/index.php?id=847&route=article/index&directory\_id=138&direct\_link=1](https://www.centraline.com/index.php?id=847&route=article/index&directory_id=138&direct_link=1%20)

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at**:**[http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf) ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2015-0984 SCADA - Gaining remote shell on Honeywell Falcon XLWEB

---

*From*: Martin Jartelius <mj () outpost24 com>

*Date*: Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:08:59 +0200

```

SCADA - EXPLOITING CVE-2015-0984 FOR SHELL ACCESS

This post is a follow up detailing how to achieve control of the actual
XLWEB SCADA controller. The vulnerability is assigned with reference
CVE-2015-0984.

Rather than the application level administrative access as discussed in
the email regarding CVE-2014-2717, this focuses on issues with the FTP,
default accounts which could not be changed, and high privileges of the
web server user resulting in a simple shell on the server.

In this case we are looking at CVE-2015-0984, or ICSA-15-076-02, but we
expect to be back with a second disclosure soon when the vendor have had
a chance to look at the latest finding, still pending a CVE, if one will
be assigned.

For those interested in a more readable version of this disclosure and
additional information, see
<https://www.outpost24.com/hacking-industrial-control-systems-case-study-falcon/>

Please note that the CVE at NVD uses a different CVSS vector than the
one in this disclosure or from ICS-CERT, stating partial confidentiality
and no availability or integrity impact. As this gives shell access to
the system, I am relatively certain the C:C/A:C/I:C is the correct
evaluation.

_________________________

*BACKGROUND*

Honeywell is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide.

The affected products, XLWeb controllers, are web-based SCADA systems.
According to Honeywell, XLWeb controllers are deployed across several
sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Waste water
Systems, and others. Honeywell estimates that these products are used
primarily in Europe and the Middle East.

_________________________

*VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW*

The vulnerability is defined as a PATH TRAVERSAL. By using a directory
traversal vulnerability in the FTP server, it is possible to gain access
to the web root directory.

A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string
is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

That is;
Access Vector – Network

Access Complexity – Low

Authentication – None <--- Built in account used to target the system

Complete impact to availability, integrity and confidentiality.

Note that NVD uses an incorrect scoring which lists integrity and
availability as unaffected, and confidentiality as partial.

_________________________

*MITIGATION*

The update for this vulnerability is Excel Web Linux version 2.04.01
(March, 2014) or later plus the programming tool CARE version 10.02
(March 2014) or later. Customers are encouraged to contact their local
Honeywell HBS branch to have their sites updated to the latest version.

In the Centraline partner channel, Excel Web controllers also have been
sold under the brand name “FALCON.” Centraline partners can directly
access <http://www.centraline.com> and get these versions.

CARE:

_________________________

*EXTENDED DISCLOSURE*

The system has an account for localization and customization of parts of
the interfaces. The account is available in numerous guides as found
online, account name is XWADMIN.

This account has access to the FTP server, and is also available for
login via TELNET if present. The XWADMIN user is also the user executing
the web-server on the platform.

The platform uses a version of PHP with some vendor modifications, of
importance to an attacker however is that the server support all the
basic functionality one would need from a simple web-shell such as the
exec and passthru functions.

As patch penetration currently is close to 0 among the internet facing
systems, and only very few have patched the critical risk from 2014, we
will not be releasing the script-kiddie friendly tools for neither
CVE-2014-2717 nor CVE-2015-0984, but the information here should be
sufficient to demonstrate the implications of the issue and the need to
apply patches.

As mentioned in the lead in, other issues were found during
documentation for this advisory, leading to shell access even on fully
patched systems, and the devices should be isolated from public
networks. Just as the vendor recommends.

*FINAL WORDS
*Many thanks to Honeywell. During a year of research in the field, only
3 vendors have reacted responsibly and remediated reported issues
associated with SCADA systems. Honeywell have done it the fastest, and
most efficient. This is why they appear in this disclosure – they have
remediated and fixed the critical risk, and we hope other vendors will
assume the same responsibility.
