- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains complete control of the system, enabling them to install software, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The user must be convinced to visit the website, typically by clicking a link in an email or instant message, or by opening a malicious attachment. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content can also be used to deliver the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick a user into visiting it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
