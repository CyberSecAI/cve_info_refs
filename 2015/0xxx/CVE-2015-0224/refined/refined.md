{
  "CVE-2015-0224": {
    "Description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way the Qpid daemon (qpidd) processed certain protocol sequences. An unauthenticated attacker able to send a specially crafted protocol sequence set could use these flaws to crash qpidd.",
    "Root cause": "The Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not properly validate certain protocol sequences, specifically the handling of sequence-sets with invalid ranges or maximal gaps.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Improper handling of malformed protocol sequences"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the Qpid daemon (qpidd).",
    "Attack vector": "An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted protocol sequences over the network.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system running the Qpid daemon (qpidd)."
