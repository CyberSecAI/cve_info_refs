- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridge has a default root password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Usage of a default password for the root account.
    - The root account can be accessed through various interfaces: ssh, telnet, command line interface, and HTTP.
    - Credentials Management (CWE-255)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain administrative privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via network through ssh, telnet, command line interface or HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the device. No authentication is required if the default password has not been changed. The attacker also needs to know (or easily find) the default password which is often publicly available.
