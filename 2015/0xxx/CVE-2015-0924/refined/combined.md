## Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridge contains a default root password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#936356

Original Release Date: 2015-01-16 | Last Revised: 2015-01-21

---

### Overview

Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridge contains a default root password.

### Description

| [**CWE-255**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html)**:****Credentials Management**  Ceragon FiberAir IP-10 Microwave Bridges contain a default root password. The root account can be accessed through ssh, telnet, command line interface, or via HTTP.The affected vendor, Ceragon, has provided the following statement:*The FibeAir IP-10 products have an embedded Linux OS.* *The root password that is within the IP-10 products is a default password and can be changed by our customers in a simple manner. The existence of such a password is documented in the product user documentation, is highlighted to the customer post shipment, and it is recommended to be changed in accordance with common password management policies.**Many of our customers have chosen to change the root password and that is based on information provided within the product documentation referring to capability and ways of changing all Admin privileges, as well as access to the Linux OS Shell.**We would like to remind again, those customers who have not changed the default root password on their installed IP-10 devices are encouraged to contact your local Ceragon representative, who will assign a customer service expert to provide a means for quick and secure update of root password in multiple devices, simultaneously.* |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain administrative privileges on the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Change your Password**Change any default passwords, and do not deploy without changing default passwords. Search engines such as Shodan can index systems exposed to the internet and default passwords are usually documented and well-known. It is often trivial for an attacker to identify and access systems on the internet using default passwords. |
