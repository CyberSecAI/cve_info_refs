## Vulnerability in Windows Photo Decoder Component Could Allow Information Disclosure (3035126)

Published: March 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user browses to a website containing a specially crafted JPEG XR (.JXR) image. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows processes JPEG XR image format files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3035126](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3035126).

## Vulnerability Information

## JPEG XR Parser Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0076

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows fails to properly handle uninitialized memory when parsing certain, specially crafted [JPEG XR](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) (.JXR) image format files. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker runs a specially crafted application on an affected system.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could host a specially crafted website (or leverage a compromised website or one that accepts or hosts user-provided content or advertisements) and then convince a user to visit the website. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit a website. A user would have to be convinced to do so, typically by way of a link in an email or Instant Messenger message that directs the user to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content through banner advertisements or other methods capable of delivering web content to affected systems.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows processes JPEG XR (.JXR) image format files.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
