Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2015-0999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the storage of OPC (OLE for Process Control) user credentials in cleartext within a configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** OPC User Credentials are not encrypted and are stored directly as plain text in a configuration file. This constitutes a violation of secure coding practices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Access to Control System:** An attacker who gains access to the configuration file can obtain the cleartext OPC credentials.
-   **Potential for System Compromise:** With the stolen OPC credentials, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to and control of the industrial control system through the OPC interface.
- The impact is rated as high for confidentiality and partial for integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with access to the local system where the configuration file is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access to the system:** An attacker needs to have access to the file system where the vulnerable configuration file resides.
-  **Low skill level:** The vulnerability is considered easily exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both "InduSoft Web Studio" and "InTouch Machine Edition 2014," version 7.1.3.2 and all previous versions.
- Schneider Electric has assigned a CVSS v2 base score of 5.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N).
-  The vulnerability is classified under CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
- A patch has been released by Schneider Electric to remediate the vulnerability.
