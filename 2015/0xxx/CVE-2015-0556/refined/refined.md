  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2015-0557",
      "root_cause": "The ARJ archiver strips a single leading slash from file paths during extraction, but fails to remove multiple leading slashes, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Directory Traversal"
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system by crafting an ARJ archive with file paths containing multiple leading slashes. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if critical files are overwritten.",
      "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted ARJ archive",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious ARJ archive and trick a user or automated system into processing it.",
      "details": "The vulnerability arises because the ARJ archiver only removes one leading slash from a file path, leaving multiple leading slashes which then allows the attacker to write to arbitrary locations. For example an attacker can create an archive containing a file path such as `//tmp/file` which would allow the attacker to write to `/tmp/file`."

    {
      "cve": "CVE-2015-0556",
      "root_cause": "The ARJ archiver follows symlinks during extraction, including those created within the archive, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Symlink Race Condition",
          "Directory Traversal"
        ],
       "impact": "An attacker can write to arbitrary locations by creating an ARJ archive that creates a symlink pointing to a location outside the target directory, and subsequently writes a file to a location relative to that symlink.  This could lead to arbitrary code execution if critical files are overwritten.",
      "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted ARJ archive.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious ARJ archive and trick a user or automated system into processing it.",
       "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to ARJ following symlinks during unpacking, even ones created within the unpacking process. For example, an attacker could create an archive that creates a symbolic link 'tmp' that points to '/tmp', and then a file 'tmp/moo' which will then write a file to '/tmp/moo'."
