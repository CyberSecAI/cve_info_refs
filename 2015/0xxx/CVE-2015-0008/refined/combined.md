## Microsoft Windows domain-configured client Group Policy fails to authenticate servers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#787252

Original Release Date: 2015-02-13 | Last Revised: 2015-02-13

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows domain-configured client Group Policy fails to authenticate servers over Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths.

### Description

| Microsoft has released [MS15-011](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-011), detailing a critical flaw in which Windows domain-configured client Group Policy fails to authenticate servers over [Universal Naming Convention (UNC)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg465305.aspx) paths. Upon connecting to a network, Group Policy runs logon scripts to receive and apply policy data from a domain controller. By joining an attacker-controlled network, the vulnerable system will execute attacker-provided scripts since the server is not required to authenticate itself. Because of the way that the Multiple UNC Provider (MUP) iterates through UNC providers to establish a connection to the domain controller, the vulnerability may be remotely exploitable when a UNC path is resolved over the Internet.  For more detailed information, visit Microsoft's [blog about hardening Group Policy](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2015/02/10/ms15-011-amp-ms15-014-hardening-group-policy.aspx) and JAS's [JASBUG Fact Sheet](https://www.jasadvisors.com/about-jas/jasbug-security-vulnerability-fact-sheet/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary code and completely compromise vulnerable systems. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update and configure Group Policy settings**In addition to [applying an update](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/MS15-011#ID0EULAC), administrators need to [configure additional Group Policy settings](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3000483) in order to protect against the vulnerability.Note that in addition to the unsupported Windows XP and 2000, Windows Server 2003 will not be receiving an update to address this vulnerability despite being a supported operating system. Furthermore, Microsoft has not identified any workarounds or mitigations, recommending that security-conscious users upgrade their operating systems. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Many versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems are confirmed vulnerable, including:       - Microsoft Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, RT, and RT 8.1 - Microsoft Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2  Unsupported operating systems such as Microsoft Windows XP and 2000 may also be affected. |

[1]Windows Server 2003 is affected, but an update is not being issued for it. See the **Update FAQ** for more information.

[2]This update is available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130) only.

## Update FAQ

**Does this update install any additional functionality?**

Yes. For customers with automatic updating enabled, this update also installs new functionality that is being deployed with [Microsoft Security Advisory 3004375](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/3004375). The new functionality, which pertains to the Windows Command Line Audit Process Creation policy, is unrelated to the vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin. When installation is complete, updates 3000483 and 3004375 will be listed as installed updates.

**Important** Customers who download and install updates manually will need to install both updates (3000483 and 3004375), which can be installed in any order.

**Windows Server 2003 is listed as an affected product; why is Microsoft not issuing an update for it?**
Although Windows Server 2003 is an affected product, Microsoft is not issuing an update for it because the comprehensive architectural changes required would jeopardize system stability and cause application compatibility problems. Microsoft recommends that security-conscious customers upgrade to a later operating system in order to keep pace with the changing security threat landscape and benefit from the more robust protections that later operating systems provide.

## Vulnerability Information

## Group Policy Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0008

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in how Group Policy receives and applies policy data when a domain-joined system connects to a domain controller. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince a victim with a domain-configured system to connect to an attacker-controlled network.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system and then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability by improving how domain-configured systems connect to domain controllers prior to Group Policy accepting configuration data.

# JASBUG: Cutting Through the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)

*Posted by Jeff Schmidt, CEO and Founder of JAS Global Advisors (11 February 2015)*

Wow. Given the rather odd nature of the JASBUG (and the story behind it), there has been a lot of discussion. As can be expected, some of the discussion gets things right, and some not so much.

To clear through the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) and focus on a few points that really matter, I’ve written some additional clarifications below. And – most importantly – I provide practical, actionable recommendations for IT professionals.

There is a lot going on here.  Let’s jump-in.

**Issue #1: The headline technical issue is an improper use of the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) for authentication.**

The DNS is a directory, not an authentication tool. It’s a phone book, not a driver license. This is why we focus so much on the infamous lock icon (and green bar) in the web browser – the TLS/X.509 certificate mechanisms provide the cryptographic authentication layer on top of the DNS lookups and subsequent traffic. Without the lock icon, you have no guarantee that you’re actually talking to www.bank.com.

Many – if not most – information security problems have roots in identification and authentication subtleties. When software designers, implementers, and/or users don’t get identification and authentication right, things usually go awry.

The web browser is designed to convey identification and authentication information to the human behind the keyboard, but what if it’s machine-to-machine communication? For example, when your Windows machine is talking to a remote file server? Or when your domain-joined Windows machine (i.e. a member of a corporate Active Directory) talks to the Active Directory Controllers?

When you browse remote file systems in Windows (e.g. \\fileserver\homedirectory), where is the lock icon and reassuring green text? When your Windows machine connects to the corporate Active Directory Controller and downloads really important things like Group Policy Objects to manage your machine, where is the cute little lock? There isn’t one. That doesn’t mean all is lost, it just means that the computers do all of this hard cryptographic authentication work in the background without making a fuss.

Or so we thought it worked like that. In the case of Windows clients, it doesn’t always happen correctly, leaving a situation where browsing to \\fileserver\homedirectory – or more interestingly \\fully.qualified.domain.name.com\homedirectory or \\1.2.3.4\homedirectory (all supported syntaxes) – your computer simply “trusts” that the remote host is who they claim without performing a cryptographic authentication. This leaves the machine vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks.

Not only are Windows clients too trusting of the responses they get back from DNS, they can also be fairly easily tricked into downgrading to unauthenticated and unencrypted transit protocols (like WebDav over http).

Microsoft’s response to both of these problems was to add a new feature called *UNC Hardened Access.* UNC Hardened Access ensures that the proper level of authentication (and/or in-transit encryption) is in place based on the sensitivity of the communication. Instead of being subject to the OS “trying too hard” to make communication work, the UNC infrastructure within Windows now allows the higher layer resource requestor to specify whether Mutual Authentication, Integrity, and/or Privacy are required for the communication. This is the right, general-purpose solution to this problem.

**As an IT system administrator, unless you have strong physical control of your entire network from end-to-end, are sure devices never physically leave your network or connect to other networks, and can assure that only trusted devices are on your network, you’ll want to enable this feature – after carefully reviewing the material from Microsoft of course.**

As developers and architects, we should be ever vigilant to improper use of the DNS for authentication. Every secure interaction that starts with a DNS resolution requires a subsequent authentication step.

**Issue #2: Active Directory relies on the DNS and interacts with the DNS in unanticipated ways.**

One can think of Active Directory is a hierarchical database layered on top of DNS technology and protocols. The interactions between Active Directory and the global Internet DNS are opaque and not universally understood by Microsoft administrators.

Active Directory clients locate resources in a Microsoft network largely through special DNS requests for A and SRV records. Bits of the Active Directory structure like the name of the Active Directory forest, Organizational Units (OUs), and the Active Directory Root wind-up in DNS queries when clients try to find resources. The DNS queries are then mutated by DNS Search Path Processing, which is also, unfortunately, opaque and sloppy.

The resulting exploration of the DNS namespace when a Windows client is looking for resources is surprising: while a simple Windows client is looking for a resource called, say, *printer.myou.myad*, that may actually result in Internet DNS queries for *printer.myou.myad.com, printer.myou.myad, printer.myou, printer.myou.com,* and so-on. If the machine is connected to the public Internet – and/or the network is configured in such a way that those queries “leak” out of the enterprise – the Internet DNS infrastructure will attempt to resolve those queries and provide pointers to these resources. Which is almost certainly not what is desired; a result from the local Active Directory controller for your domain is expected.

This is a perverse issue.  Over the course of our research, over 200,000 distinct Active Directories *reached-out to us* over the Internet via DNS registrations we contrived in various ways.  Think Robert Stucke’s fantastic DEFCON21 [talk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPbyDSvGasw "talk")

See [SAC064](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-064-en.pdf "SAC064") for more information about DNS search list processing.

Microsoft did not address “query leakage” or Active Directory naming problems as related to the global Internet DNS in this round of patches. However, if UNC Hardened Access is enabled, at least in theory even leaked queries would not result in an exploitable situation because the strong authentication step is still required providing cryptographic proof that the client is talking to the server it thinks it is. So even if these queries make it out to the Internet, no harm done.

**As an IT system administrator, you should have mechanisms in place to monitor DNS query leakage. Internal DNS queries associated with Active Directory should not be permitted to leave the enterprise boundaries. Additionally, your Active Directory should be named within a global Internet DNS namespace you control to further reduce your risk. For example, if you own company.com, your Active Directory should be rooted in corp.company.com or something similar, so any queries that do leak onto the global Internet DNS go back to you and not to someone else.**
