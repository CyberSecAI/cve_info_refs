{
  "cve": "CVE-2015-0225",
  "description": "It was found that Apache Cassandra bound an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces. A remote attacker able to access the RMI, an API for the transport and remote execution of serialized Java, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the user running Cassandra.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Apache Cassandra, by default, binds an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface",
      "Binding to all network interfaces"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution as the user running Cassandra.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the JMX/RMI interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the JMX/RMI interface exposed by Cassandra. No authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mitigation": "Users can mitigate this vulnerability by manually configuring encryption and authentication for JMX or by upgrading to Cassandra versions 2.0.14 or 2.1.4.",
     "patches": "The vulnerability was patched in JBoss Operations Network 3.3.4, which included updated Cassandra artifacts with the fix and configurations to disable the unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface."
