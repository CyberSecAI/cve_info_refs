Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the All in One SEO Pack WordPress plugin's automatic meta description generation feature. This feature, enabled by default, extracts content from a page to create the meta description. The vulnerability lies in the fact that this description is generated and exposed even for password-protected pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The core weakness is that the plugin exposes parts of password-protected content through the automatically generated meta description. This bypasses the intended access control mechanisms of password-protected pages.
*   **Default Configuration:** The automatic meta description generation is enabled by default, making the vulnerability more widespread.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to potentially sensitive content from password-protected pages by viewing the meta description. This can lead to unauthorized access to information that was meant to be kept private.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network access, as the meta description is included in the HTML source code of the page which can be accessed remotely.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The meta description is generated and exposed regardless of whether the viewer is authenticated or not, thus the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires only a web browser and network access to the affected website.
*   No specific privileges or credentials are required to access the exposed meta description.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is due to the plugin's default behavior of creating meta descriptions from page content, which is then exposed publicly, even when the page is password-protected. This leads to information exposure with the content of the page which was supposed to be private.
