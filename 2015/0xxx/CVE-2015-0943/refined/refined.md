Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2015-0943:

**CVE-2015-0943**

*   **Root Cause:**  The communication between the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne thick client and the backend SQL server is done in plain text without tamper protection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Plain Text Communication:** All data exchanged between the client and server is unencrypted.
    *   **Lack of Tamper Protection:** No mechanisms exist to verify the integrity of the data in transit, allowing for manipulation.
    *  **Lack of Replay Protection:**  Captured messages sent from the client to the server during user login can be re-used to gain access.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack would allow the attacker to:
        *   Completely modify all banking/payment information.
        *   Access bank account encryption keys.
        *   Modify all payment records.
    *   **Data Exposure:**  Even without a man-in-the-middle attack, packet captures can reveal:
        *   Sensitive banking information.
        *   User credentials for the banking system.
        *   Possibly also encryption keys.
    *   **Impersonation:** Attackers can potentially impersonate authorized users to the banks using compromised data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** Intercepting network traffic between the client and the server.
    *   **Packet Capture:**  Obtaining network captures to extract sensitive data.
    *   **Replay Attack:** Re-using captured login messages to gain access.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. This could be on the local network, or possibly through a compromised network device or router.
    *  **Packet capture capability:** The attacker needs to be able to capture the network traffic.
    *   **Knowledge of the System:** The attacker would benefit from a basic understanding of the Basware Banking/Maksuliikenne system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor acknowledged the issue and promised a fix using native Solid DB encryption in 2015.
*   A workaround involving third-party encryption solutions was suggested.
*   Affected versions include at least versions 8.40.1.0 to 8.90.07.X.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSSv2 score of 8.3 (High).
*   The CVSSv2 Vector is (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating Adjacent Network, Low Complexity, No Authentication, with complete Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact.
