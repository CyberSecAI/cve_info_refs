## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.8.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 8 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6549, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591,
CVE-2014-6593, CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403,

# RHSA-2015:0079 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.7.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 7 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591, CVE-2014-6593,
CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403, CVE-2015-0406,
CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412, CVE-2015-0413)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

Note: With this update, the Oracle Java SE now disables the SSL 3.0
protocol to address the CVE-2014-3566 issue (also known as POODLE). Refer
to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section for
instructions on how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed.

All users of java-1.7.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 7 Update 75 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

Updated:
2015-01-26
# RHSA-2015:0086 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: java-1.6.0-sun security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-sun packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 6 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6585, CVE-2014-6587, CVE-2014-6591, CVE-2014-6593,
CVE-2014-6601, CVE-2015-0383, CVE-2015-0395, CVE-2015-0403, CVE-2015-0406,
CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412)

The CVE-2015-0383 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

Note: With this update, the Oracle Java SE now disables the SSL 3.0
protocol to address the CVE-2014-3566 issue (also known as POODLE). Refer
to the Red Hat Bugzilla bug linked to in the References section for
instructions on how to re-enable SSL 3.0 support if needed.

All users of java-1.6.0-sun are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 6 Update 91 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-ibm packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Satellite 5.6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the IBM Java
Runtime Environment shipped as part of Red Hat Satellite 5.6. In a typical
operating environment, these are of low security risk as the runtime is not
used on untrusted applets.

Several flaws were fixed in the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment.

CVE-2015-0407, CVE-2015-0408, CVE-2015-0410, CVE-2015-0412)

The CVE-2014-4262 and CVE-2014-6512 issues were discovered by Florian
Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.

Users of Red Hat Satellite 5.6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain the IBM Java SE 6 SR16-FP3 release. For this
update to take effect, Red Hat Satellite must be restarted
("/usr/sbin/rhn-satellite restart"), as well as all running instances of
IBM Java.

## Solution

Oracle JRE is updated in VMware products to address a critical security issue that existed in earlier releases of Oracle JRE.

VMware products running JRE 1.7 Update 75 or newer and JRE 1.6 Update 91 or newer are not vulnerable to CVE-2014-6593, as documented in the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory of January 2015.

This advisory also includes the other security issues that are addressed  in JRE 1.7 Update 75 and JRE 1.6 Update 91. The References section provides a link to the JRE advisory.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2014-6593 to this issue. This issue is also known as "SKIP" or "SKIP-TLS".

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Java Runtime affect Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus (Multiple CVEs)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition, Versions 6 and 7 that are used by Tivoli Netcool/OMNIbus. . These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in April 2015. This bulletin also addresses FREAK: Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT keys" SSL/TLS vulnerability and RC4 Bar Mitzvah Attack for SSL/TLS vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:**[CVE-2015-0488](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0488)An unspecified vulnerability related to the JSSE component could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

CVSS Base Score: 5

**CVEID:**[CVE-2015-2808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2808) **DESCRIPTION:**The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to remotely expose account credentials without requiring an active man-in-the-middle session. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve credit card data or other sensitive information. This vulnerability is commonly referred to as "Bar Mitzvah Attack".

CVSS Base Score: 5

**CVEID:**[CVE-2015-0204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0204) **DESCRIPTION:**A vulnerability in the OpenSSL ssl3\_get\_key\_exchange function could allow a remote attacker to downgrade the security of certain TLS connections. An OpenSSL client accepts the use of an RSA temporary key in a non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite. This could allow a remote attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques to facilitate brute-force decryption of TLS/SSL traffic between vulnerable clients and servers. This vulnerability is also known as the FREAK attack.
