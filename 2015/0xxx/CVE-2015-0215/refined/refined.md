Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0215:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient access check in the calendar functions of Moodle's web services. Specifically, the `calendar/externallib.php` file lacks the necessary `self::validate_context($context)` call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper context validation in the web services calendar functions, allowing unauthorized access to calendar event data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:**  An attacker, even without sufficient permissions, could access information about calendar events via web services. This could expose sensitive schedule data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Services:** The attack vector is through the web services interface of Moodle. By using the API, an attacker can call calendar functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Enrolled User:** The attacker needs to be an enrolled user on the Moodle platform.
- **Web service access:** The attacker needs the capability to send requests to the web service interface.

**Additional Notes:**
