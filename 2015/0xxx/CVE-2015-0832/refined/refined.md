{
  "CVE-2015-0832": {
    "description": "Appended period to hostnames can bypass HPKP and HSTS protections",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the browser treats hostnames with a trailing period (e.g., 'example.com.') as a different origin than the same hostname without a period ('example.com').",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypassing of HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)",
      "Bypassing of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a valid certificate for the domain including the trailing period could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, potentially intercepting or manipulating user communications and credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor would need to obtain a valid certificate for a domain name that includes a trailing period.",
       "The attacker would need to perform a MITM attack by routing the victim's traffic through their malicious server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the victim's network traffic (e.g., by being on the same network) and possess a valid certificate for the target domain with the appended period."
