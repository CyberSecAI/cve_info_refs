- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect escaping of quotes used for identifiers and values in the Zend\Db PostgreSQL adapter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Potential SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or other database-related attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating input that is used in SQL queries through the vulnerable PostgreSQL adapter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that is used in the SQL queries constructed using the vulnerable Zend Framework component.
