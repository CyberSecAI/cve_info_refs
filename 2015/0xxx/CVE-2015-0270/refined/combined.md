# ZF2015-02: Potential SQL injection in PostgreSQL Zend\Db adapter

`Zend\Db`'s [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) adapter was incorrectly
escaping quotes used for identifiers and values, which could lead to potential
SQL injection vectors.

## Action Taken

A patch was written that provides the correct PostgreSQL escaping sequence for
quotes used for identifiers and values, and tests were added to ensure
correctness going forward.

The patch fixing the issue has been applied in the following versions:

* Zend Framework 2.2.10
* Zend Framework 2.3.5

This vulnerability has also been disclosed as [CVE-2015-0270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0270).

## Recommendations

If you are using the Zend\Db PostgreSQL adapter, we recommend upgrading immediately.
