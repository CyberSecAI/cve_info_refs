Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the KENT-WEB Clip Board software. This allows a remote attacker to manipulate file paths and delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The software does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directory. This is the primary weakness that enables the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A remote attacker can delete any file on the server accessible by the web server process, leading to data loss, website malfunctions, and potential system instability.
*   **Availability Impact:** The deletion of necessary files can render the web application or the entire server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, meaning an attacker doesn't need local access to the server.
*   **Unauthenticated:** Exploitation does not require any form of authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the path traversal vulnerability (presumably, by manipulating file paths in the request).

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is present in Clip Board versions 4.02 and earlier. The attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the server. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication, making it relatively easy to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS base score is 6.4, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
*   The provided documentation does not specify the exact mechanism for exploiting this path traversal, but it typically involves manipulating file paths, e.g., using "../" sequences to traverse up directory structures.
*   The vulnerability is described in JVN#62298871 and JVNDB-2015-000028, both referencing CVE-2015-0888.
* The vendor (WebCreate Ltd) has been notified and a solution is to update the software to the latest version.
