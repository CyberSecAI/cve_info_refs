Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco TelePresence VCS   extends the benefits of face-to-face video collaboration across networks   and organizations by supporting any-to-any video and telepresence   communications.      Cisco Expressway is designed specifically for   comprehensive   collaboration services provided through Cisco Unified Communications   Manager, Cisco Business Edition, or Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution.   It features established firewall-traversal technology and helps   redefine traditional enterprise collaboration boundaries.      Cisco TelePresence Conductor simplifies multiparty video collaboration by orchestrating the allocation of conferencing resources for every user in a   meeting.      **SDP Media Description Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) packet handler   function could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a   reload of the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling of an exception when receiving crafted SDP packets. An   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SDP   packets to the affected system.      **Note:** This vulnerability can be triggered by SDP messages sent via UDP or   TCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.   The default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP   port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061. This vulnerability can be triggered via IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) packets.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCus96593](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus96593) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID [CSCun73192](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun73192) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor.      This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0652.      **Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the authentication   code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the system   login and successfully authenticate to the system.   The   vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters passed   during the login process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability   by sending a crafted request to the system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the authentication   controls and successfully log in to the system. An attacker would need to   have knowledge of a valid username. The attacker will receive the privilege of that user after logging in. This vulnerability could give the attacker administrative access to the affected system.         **Note:** This vulnerability can be exploited over HTTPS only and targeting the management interface of the affected system. A valid TCP handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via IPv4 and IPv6 packets.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCur02680](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur02680) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID [CSCur05556](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur05556) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor      This vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0653.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF//CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 0.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 0.0 |
