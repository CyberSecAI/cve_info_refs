## Overview

Squid contains a vulnerability where inputs are not properly validated.

## Products Affected

* Squid versions prior to 3.1.1-STABLE

According to the developer, this vulnerability was addressed in 3.1.0.10-beta and that all stable Squid versions 3.1.x and later are not affected by this vulnerability.

## Description

Squid is a caching proxy server. Squid contains a vulnerability where server responses that contain invalid values in the Content-Length of the HTTP header are sent to the client.

## Impact

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

This JVN publication was delayed to 2015/2/20 after the developer fix was developed. From the fiscal year 2011, JPCERT/CC is using a new vendor coordination procedure. This new procedure came from the recommendation of the fiscal year 2010 "Study Group on Information System Vulnerability Handling" aimed at more timely JVN publications.

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2015.02.20 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | The access conditions are somewhat specialized. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |

Base Score:4.3
