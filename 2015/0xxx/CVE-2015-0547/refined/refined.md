ESA-2015-108: EMC Documentum D2 Multiple DQL Injection Vulnerabilities
```

Based on the provided information, this content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple DQL Injection Vulnerabilities

**Affected Product:** EMC Documentum D2

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious DQL queries.

**Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in DQL queries. This allows for manipulation of queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify existing data, and potentially disrupt the functionality of the application.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious DQL code within the application's input fields or parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have some form of interaction with the affected application, such as access to user input fields.
