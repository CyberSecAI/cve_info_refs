# CVE-2015-0260: Kallithea: API key of repository's creator exposed by get\_repo API method

---

*From*: Andrew Shadura <andrew () shadura me>

*Date*: Tue, 10 Feb 2015 23:32:57 +0100

```
Hello,

We have recently discovered a security issue in Kallithea [0].
API key of repository's creator is exposed by get_repo API method.

Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been found in Kallithea, allowing remote attacker to gain
access to the repositories with privileges of another existing user.

Description
===========

The get_repo API method doesn't check the identity of the caller and exposes
all details about the repository "followers" regardless of whether they have
access to such data or not.

The structures returned by this method contain such sensitive information as
last login timestamp, IP addresses, authentication method details and private
API access keys:

    "followers": [
        {
            "active": true,
            "admin": true,
            "api_key": "f5****9c",
            "api_keys": [
                "f5*****9c"
            ],
            "email": "user.name () company com",
            "emails": [
                "user.name () company com"
            ],
            "extern_name": "username",
            "extern_type": "pam",
            "firstname": "User",
            "ip_addresses": [],
            "last_login": "2015-02-08T18:17:39",
            "lastname": "Name",
            "user_id": 3,
            "username": "username"
        }

Impact
======

The exposed information allows attacker to track users and gain access to the
repositories using their API keys. In the case the user also has administrator
rights, it is possible for the attacker to gain full administrator access to
the Kallithea instance.

Workaround
==========

Users are advised to remove the API controller to prevent potential attackers
from accessing the API. This can be achieved by deleting or commenting out
lines 458-460 in kallithea/config/routing.py. An alternative to that may be
blocking or limiting access to /_admin/api URLs in the configuration of the
webserver or a front-end reverse proxy.

A patch to remove API controller may look like this:

    diff --git a/kallithea/config/routing.py b/kallithea/config/routing.py
    --- a/kallithea/config/routing.py
    +++ b/kallithea/config/routing.py
    @@ -455,9 +455,6 @@ def make_map(config):
         #==========================================================================
         # API V2
         #==========================================================================
    -    with rmap.submapper(path_prefix=ADMIN_PREFIX,
    -                        controller='api/api') as m:
    -        m.connect('api', '/api')

         #USER JOURNAL
         rmap.connect('journal', '%s/journal' % ADMIN_PREFIX,

Resolution
==========

Kallithea project has released a patch fixing this issue by removing the
sensitive information from API calls. It is strongly recommended that users
apply this patch. The patch applies to both 0.1 release and the latest
Mercurial tip.

Unfortunately, this patch disables some API functionality where the information
exposure occured. We will continue seeking a solution which prevents unauthorised
access and at the time doesn't break existing API functionality. As soon
as such solution is developed, we'll notify our users.

Users are also advised to re-set or remove all existing API keys from the
database. For the users having SQLite or PostgreSQL as the database backend
a possible way to do so is to run the following SQL statements:

    update users set api_key='disabled-'||random();
    update user_api_keys set api_key='disabled-'||random();

Affected versions
=================

The issue is currenly present in all available Kallithea versions. Also,
the issue affects publicly available versions of RhodeCode that support
JSON-RPC API interface.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## RhodeCode Enterprise 2.2.7 Security Release

Published on February 12, 2015, by Sebastian

---

As part of our on-going efforts to keep our software stable and secure, we are informing our users today that our team discovered a security issue within the RhodeCode Enterprise API. We are releasing today RhodeCode Entprise 2.2.7 which fixes the security issue.

#### Vulnerability description

Users with both API and read access to a repository can obtain other users API keys (`api_keys`). The API methods listed below reveal the `api_keys` of the repository owner, or members of a particular User Group (`user_group`). The new release contains a security patch to obfuscate user API keys when these methods are used, as well as a few other improvements to the system.

* `get_repo`
* `update_repo`
* `get_locks`
* `get_user_groups`

These API methods don’t check if the caller has super-admin access and expose all repository details. This only applies if there is an existing user that already has access to the RhodeCode system.

The exposed data from an API call allows an attacker to obtain access to other users `api_keys`. If that user has administrator rights, the attacker could start using the obtained `api_keys` to change system parameters.

#### Upgrade to 2.2.7 Is Fixing Issue

Today we are releasing RhodeCode Enterprise 2.2.7 which contains an **complete fix to that vulnerability**. To expedite the adoption at our complete user base and to ensure a smooth upgrade we are offering **free support to our full customer base**, paying and non-paying.

Please [contact us](https://rhodecode.com/contact/) for assistance how to upgrade your RhodeCode Enterprise installation to the latest version 2.2.7

#### Additional Security Measures

System administrators are advised to reset or remove all existing API keys from the database. For users with the `ishell` command, you can use the following example reset after running `paster ishell production.ini`:

```
from rhodecode.lib.auth import generate_auth_token
for u in User.query().all():
    u.api_key = generate_auth_token(u.username)
    Session().add(u)
    Session().commit()

for auth_token in UserApiKeys.query().all():
    auth_token.api_key = generate_auth_token('hello')
    Session().add(auth_token)
    Session().commit()

```

For database access only, we advise running an update statement on those database tables:

```
update users set api_key='';
update user_api_keys set api_key='';

```
