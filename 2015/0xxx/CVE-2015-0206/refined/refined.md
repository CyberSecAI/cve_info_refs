Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `dtls1_buffer_record` function within the `d1_pkt.c` file of OpenSSL. This function handles incoming DTLS records and buffers them for later processing.  The root cause is when duplicate records for the next epoch arrive and are not correctly handled, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** When duplicate DTLS records for the next epoch are received, the `dtls1_buffer_record` function fails to detect and drop them, which causes a memory leak.
*   **Improper Error Handling:**  The function does not properly treat errors from `ssl3_setup_buffers` or `pqueue_insert` as fatal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending numerous specially crafted DTLS packets. These duplicate records consume excessive memory resources, causing a memory leak leading to a DoS by exhausting all available memory on the DTLS server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious DTLS records over the network to a vulnerable OpenSSL server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send network packets to the target system.
*  **Understanding of DTLS:** The attacker needs the capability to craft DTLS records with duplicate sequence numbers and for the next epoch.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided content also highlights the 'FREAK' downgrade attack, but it is related to CVE-2015-0204 and not CVE-2015-0206
* The Suse information lists a CVSS base score of 10 for this vulnerability. However, the vulnerability affects only the OpenSSL client side, not the server, so the complete C-I-A impact is only relevant for the client. The correct base score for a pure client-side vulnerability is 4.3, as reported by NVD. The SUSE information also lists fixes for a number of other CVEs, these are not directly related to CVE-2015-0206.
* The Red Hat information confirms the vulnerability affects the client, and provides a low severity rating. It also notes the flaw can be triggered by sending repeated DTLS records with the same sequence number but for the next epoch, causing a crash.
* The OpenSSL advisory highlights that this vulnerability occurs when OpenSSL is built with the "no-ssl3" option.
* The Suse Security advisory indicates the issue was fixed in OpenSSL versions before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a
* The fixes address the memory leak by correctly handling duplicate records for the next epoch and returning a fatal error if buffer setup or queue insertion fails.

In summary, CVE-2015-0206 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable OpenSSL DTLS server by exploiting a memory leak in the handling of duplicate records.
