## Vulnerability Information for CVE-2015-0051

The provided document contains information about CVE-2015-0051.

**Title:** Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability

**Description:**
A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.

**Affected Software:** Internet Explorer 8

**Severity:**
- Windows Clients: Important
- Windows Servers: Low

**Impact:**
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use an ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

**Attack Vector:**
Successful exploitation requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer.

**Mitigation:**
The update addresses the vulnerabilities by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.

**Mitigating Factors:**
Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for these vulnerabilities.

**Workarounds:**
Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for these vulnerabilities.
