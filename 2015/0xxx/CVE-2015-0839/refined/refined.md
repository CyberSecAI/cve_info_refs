{
  "cve": "CVE-2015-0839",
  "description": "The hp-plugin utility, included in the hplip package, downloads a binary driver and verifies it via a key specified by the key's short ID. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to generate a key with the expected short ID and trick a user into downloading a malicious binary.",
  "affected_components": [
    "hp-plugin utility in hplip package"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The hp-plugin utility uses a short GPG key ID to verify downloaded binary drivers. This makes it vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker could generate a key with the same short ID.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Insecure verification of downloaded plugins using short key ID."
  ],
  "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can cause systems running hp-plugin to download and execute malicious code by providing a malicious plugin signed with a crafted key that has a matching short key ID.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Man-in-the-middle attack during the download of the hp-plugin."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify the network traffic between the system running hp-plugin and the keyserver (pgp.mit.edu). The attacker must be able to upload a malicious key with the expected short key ID to the keyserver.",
  "additional_details": [
   "The vulnerability was reported on the oss-security mailing list.",
   "The vulnerability was fixed by changing the verification process to use the full fingerprint or the full key instead of the short key id.",
   "Some Linux distributions opted to disable the hp-plugin functionality completely due to the insecurity of the download mechanism.",
   "The Debian maintainer suggested shipping the whole public key with HPLIP to avoid the keyserver step.",
    "An interim fix involves using the long key ID instead of the short key ID, but the proper fix is to ship the whole public key with the HPLIP software."
