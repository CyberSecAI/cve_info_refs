Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2015-0057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel-mode driver (Win32k.sys) due to improper handling of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory handling in the `win32k.sys` driver.
- Allows for elevation of privilege.
- The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges.
- An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- Attackers could read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.
- Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode may also be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- An attacker needs to log on to the system first.
- A specially crafted application needs to be executed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid logon credentials.
- The attacker must be able to log on locally to the system.
- The attacker must be able to run a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was addressed by correcting how the kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft was informed about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- There was no indication of public use of the vulnerability to attack customers at the time the security bulletin was released.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified by Microsoft.
