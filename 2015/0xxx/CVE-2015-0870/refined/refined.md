Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Fumy News Clipper2 weblog CGI application, specifically within the `hb.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view a page containing the injected script. This could result in:
  - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
  - Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim without their knowledge.
  - Defacing or altering the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed, injects a script into the vulnerable `hb.cgi` script. This indicates the attack vector is likely through user-controlled input via HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click on a malicious link, or browse to a malicious site which contains the exploit.
- They do not need special access to the target server.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions 2.4.0 and earlier of Fumy News Clipper2.
- The vulnerability is located in the `hb.cgi` file.
- The vendor has released version 2.5.0 to address the vulnerability.
