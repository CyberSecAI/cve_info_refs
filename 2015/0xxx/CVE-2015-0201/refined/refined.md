- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Java SockJS client generates session IDs that are not sufficiently random.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure session ID generation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially send messages to another user's session by predicting or guessing the session ID.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the predictable session ID generation in the Java SockJS client, an attacker can potentially send messages to another user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send messages using the Java SockJS client.
