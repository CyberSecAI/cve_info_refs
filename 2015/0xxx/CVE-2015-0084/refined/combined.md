## Vulnerability in Windows Task Scheduler Could Allow Security Feature Bypass (3030377)

Published: March 10, 2015

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow a user with limited privileges on an affected system to leverage Task Scheduler to execute files that they do not have permissions to run. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass access control list (ACL) checks and run privileged executables.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows RT, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Task Scheduler validates impersonation levels. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

## Vulnerability Information

## Task Scheduler Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2015-0084

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Windows Task Scheduler fails to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels. The vulnerability could allow a user with limited privileges on an affected system to leverage Task Scheduler to execute files that they do not have permissions to run.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass ACL checks and run privileged executables. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Task Scheduler validates impersonation levels.

Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was originally issued Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.
