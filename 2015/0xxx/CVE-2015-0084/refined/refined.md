- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the Windows Task Scheduler failing to properly validate and enforce impersonation levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Security feature bypass. The Task Scheduler does not properly validate impersonation levels, allowing users with limited privileges to execute files that they don't have permissions to run. This bypasses access control list (ACL) checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass ACL checks and run privileged executables. This can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to system resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves leveraging the Task Scheduler to execute files that a user would not normally have permission to run.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with limited privileges on the affected system. They need to be able to interact with the Task Scheduler.
