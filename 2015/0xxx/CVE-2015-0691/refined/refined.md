Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2015-0691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within a Cisco-signed Java Archive (JAR) executable, specifically the `cache.jar` file, which is part of the Cache Cleaner component of Cisco Secure Desktop. The root cause is attributed to "insufficient controls while executing the `cache.jar` file."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the client host.
*   **Insufficient Controls:**  The lack of adequate controls during the execution of `cache.jar` allows the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user who executes the affected JAR file. This means the attacker can gain control over the victim's system.
*   **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:C/I:C/A:C). This signifies that an attacker could read sensitive data, modify system configurations, and render the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Malicious Website Redirect:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious website that serves a crafted package. This package contains the vulnerable `cache.jar` file along with additional malicious executables.
*   **Exploitation of Signed JAR:** Because the malicious `cache.jar` file is signed by Cisco, it can be exploited against any user, not just users of Cisco Secure Desktop. This is due to the way Java handles signed JAR files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and redirect users to it.
*   **Crafted Package:** The attacker needs to create a malicious package containing the vulnerable `cache.jar` file and additional malicious executables.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability, hence the "unauthenticated" aspect of the attack vector

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory mentions that the Cache Cleaner feature had been deprecated since November 2012.
* Cisco provided SHA-1 hashes for the vulnerable .jar files, which can be blacklisted using Java's Blacklist Jar feature
* Cisco also requested that Java blacklist the identified .jar files by default.
* No fixed software was released, and customers were advised to migrate away from using the Cisco Secure Desktop packages that include the vulnerable .jar file
