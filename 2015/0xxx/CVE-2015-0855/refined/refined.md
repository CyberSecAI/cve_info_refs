Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-0855

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `os.system()` in the `_mediaLibraryPlayCb()` function within `pitivi/mainwindow.py`. This function is triggered when a user double-clicks a file in Pitivi's media library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Command Injection:** The `os.system()` function directly executes a string containing a filename/path, which is constructed using user-provided data. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a file path with embedded shell metacharacters (e.g., `$(command)`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the same privileges as the user running Pitivi.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially-Crafted File Path:** An attacker needs to create a directory hierarchy or file path that includes shell commands within it (e.g., using `$()`).
*   **Media Library Interaction:** The attacker must trick the user into adding this specially-crafted path/file to Pitivi's media library and then double-clicking it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create files or directories with malicious paths/names and have the user add these files/directories to their Pitivi media library. This could be achieved through sharing files via removable media, a network share, or a website offering media files.
* The attacker does not need local access to the target machine, as the exploit is triggered through user interaction with the Pitivi application.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
*   The provided content includes details on the vulnerable code location (`pitivi/mainwindow.py:_mediaLibraryPlayCb()`).
*   It also provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the vulnerability using a crafted directory structure (`images/$(xeyes)/`)
*   The provided patch shows the fix, which replaces the insecure `os.system()` with `subprocess.call()`, thereby avoiding command injection.
*   The content mentions that `_playRenderedFileButtonClickedCb()` in `render.py` is also likely affected.
