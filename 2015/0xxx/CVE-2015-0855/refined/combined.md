### Bug Description

SYNOPSIS:

       Double-clicking a file in the user's media library with

       a specially-crafted path or filename allows for

       arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the

       user running Pitivi.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

    1. Create a directory hierarchy like so: "images/$(xeyes)/"

    2. Place an image "hello.png" in "images/$(xeyes)/".

    2. Drag and drop "images" to the Pitivi media library.

    3. Double click the image "hello.png" in the media library

The `xeyes` program (if installed on your system) should start.

See pitivi/mainwindow.py:\_mediaLibraryPlayCb().

An exploit scenario would require an attacker to provide a

specially-crafted directory hierarchy or file path. Since Pitivi does

not expose the path to the user, and a workflow of consuming content

created by others is common when working with media files, such a

scenario occurring is not hard to imagine.

See [original description](comments/0)

Subject: pitivi: CVE-2015-0855: Insecure use of os.system()

Hi

Luke Faraone reported the following issue in pitivi[0] to the Debian
security team on 13th of september, which got CVE-2015-0855 assigned.
There seems to have been a problem in propagating the CVE assigned
though, so we apologies for that. The assigned CVE is not mentioned in
the NEWS, but see below for the fixing commit.

Luke Faraone <lfaraone@...ian.org>:
> SYNOPSIS:
>                 Double-clicking a file in the user's media library with

>                 arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the

>              2. Drag and drop "images" to the Pitivi media library.

This issue was fixed upstream in 0.95 with commit
45a4c84edb3b4343f199bba1c65502e3f49f5bb2[1].
