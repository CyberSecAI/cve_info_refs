Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect permissions check in the Beans component of OpenJDK during resource loading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Permissions Check:** The core weakness is that the Java sandbox incorrectly grants permissions to code when loading resources using the Beans component. This could lead to access to resources that should be restricted.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:**  An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
*   **Access to Sensitive Resources:** Attackers could request and access resources that should not be accessible, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious actions.
* **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution** Through memory corruption via other CVEs, this could lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Java Applications/Applets:** The vulnerability can be exploited by running a malicious Java application or applet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to run untrusted Java code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious Java application or applet within a vulnerable Java environment. This could be achieved by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page hosting a vulnerable applet, or executing a malicious Java application.

**Additional Information:**

*   Multiple vendors mention the vulnerability affects OpenJDK, Oracle JDK and IBM JDK.
*  The vulnerability is also related to a directory traversal issue when handling jar files (CVE-2005-1080, CVE-2015-0480)
*  Multiple sources indicate the fix is related to Oracle Critical Patch Update - April 2015
* The fix is present in IcedTea6 1.13.7 and IcedTea7 2.5.5
