Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0800:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in the DNS resolver of Firefox for Android. This PRNG was derived from an older version of the `Bionic` libc library. The insufficient randomness made the generated identifiers predictable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Weak PRNG:** The core issue was that the DNS resolver used a predictable algorithm to generate random IDs for DNS queries.
- **Vulnerable Code:** The code was based on an older, vulnerable version of the Android Bionic library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **DNS Poisoning:** An attacker could predict the DNS query IDs. This allows them to inject false DNS records into the resolver's cache.
- **Spoofing:** By poisoning the DNS cache, the attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Cookie Theft:** This could potentially lead to the theft of cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned in the network path could inject malicious DNS responses when a user makes a DNS request. By correctly guessing the ID, they can make their malicious response accepted by the resolver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify DNS traffic between the user's device and the DNS server. This could be achieved through a MitM attack on a public or compromised network.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the spoofed response within a specific time window before the legitimate response arrives.
- **Prediction:** The attacker needs to correctly predict the DNS transaction ID generated by the weak PRNG, which was made possible due to its insufficient randomness.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was specific to the Firefox for Android platform and did not affect desktop versions.
- The fix involved updating the random number generation logic within the DNS resolver with a more robust algorithm from the upstream Bionic library.
- The bug report references CVE-2012-2808, which is the original vulnerability in Android's DNS resolver. This CVE-2015-0800 is related to the same vulnerability being present in Firefox for Android due to an outdated component.
- The fix was included in Firefox 37.
