Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of WebSocket PING frames within the `mod_lua` module of the Apache HTTP Server. Specifically, after a Lua script calls the `r:wsupgrade()` function to establish a WebSocket connection, the module fails to properly handle subsequent PING frames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect WebSocket PING Handling:** After a Lua script initiates a WebSocket upgrade using `r:wsupgrade()`, the `mod_lua` module does not respond correctly to WebSocket PING frames. Instead of sending back a PONG frame, it attempts to invoke the Lua script again.
*   **Child Process Crash:** A maliciously crafted WebSocket PING frame sent after the upgrade can lead to a crash in the child process handling the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing the child process. This can disrupt the availability of the web service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending a specifically crafted WebSocket PING frame.
*   **WebSocket Protocol:** The attack leverages the WebSocket protocol and its PING frame functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server.
*   **WebSocket Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send WebSocket PING frames.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:**  The attacker must target a WebSocket endpoint using mod_lua and `r:wsupgrade()`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions up to 2.4.12.
*   The fix involves ensuring mod\_lua correctly responds to a WebSocket PING after `r:wsupgrade()` by sending a PONG frame rather than invoking the Lua script again.
*   The issue was discovered by Guido Vranken and submitted/fixed by Edward Lu.

The provided content from GitHub shows the fix was included in commits `643f0fcf3b8ab09a68f0ecd2aa37aafeda3e63ef` and `78eb3b9235515652ed141353d98c239237030410` which involve modifications to the `CHANGES` file and `modules/lua/lua_request.c` file. The `CHANGES` file notes that mod\_lua was not properly responding to a websockets PING and was instead invoking the specified script, and `lua_request.c` shows that the fix prevents a recursive call to lua\_websocket\_read function. The ubuntu and opensuse mailing list contents confirm the vulnerability and provide patch information
