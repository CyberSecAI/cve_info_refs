Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-0647, CVE-2015-0648 and CVE-2015-0649 which are all related:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CVE-2015-0647:** Incorrect handling of malformed UDP packets directed at a CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) port.
*   **CVE-2015-0648:** Incorrect handling of a sequence of TCP packets directed at a CIP port.
*  **CVE-2015-0649:** Incorrect handling of malformed TCP packets directed at a CIP port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation and handling of malformed packets in the CIP implementation within Cisco IOS Software. This leads to exploitable conditions when processing crafted packets.
*   Specifically for CVE-2015-0648, a memory leak vulnerability due to a specific sequence of TCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2015-0647 & CVE-2015-0649:** Denial of Service (DoS) - Successful exploitation leads to a reload of the forwarding plane, interrupting services on the affected device. Repeated exploitation can cause a sustained DoS.
*   **CVE-2015-0648:** Memory leak which can eventually lead to a device reload and DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated attackers** can exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **CVE-2015-0647:** Sending crafted IPv4 UDP packets to ports 2222 or 44818 of a CIP enabled device.
*   **CVE-2015-0648 & CVE-2015-0649:** Sending crafted IPv4 TCP packets to port 44818 of a CIP enabled device. TCP three-way handshake needs to be successful in these cases.
*   Only IPv4 packets can be used. IPv6 packets, UDP packets for TCP based vulnerabilities and packets that transit the affected device cannot trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the targeted device.
*   No authentication is required.
*   The targeted device needs to have the CIP feature enabled. CIP is not enabled by default.
*   For TCP based attacks, a successful TCP three-way handshake is needed before the crafted packets are sent

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerabilities are independent, and a device affected by one may not be affected by others.
*   Cisco IOS XR and Cisco IOS XE software are not affected.
*   No workarounds are available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address these issues.
