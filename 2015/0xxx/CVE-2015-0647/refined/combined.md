| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/R/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets destined to UDP ports 2222 or 44818 on an affected device. TCP packets, packets transiting an affected device, or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 packets to UDP ports 2222 or 44818 on an affected device that is configured for CIP.      Cisco IOS Software may be affected if CIP is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. By default, CIP is not enabled in Cisco IOS Software.      To determine whether CIP is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include cip** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **cip enable** in the output of **show running-config | include cip** indicates that CIP is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include cip** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS Software with the CIP feature enabled:   ```   Switch# show running-config | include cip cip security password  cip enable   ```      **Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Packet Memory Leak Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to leak memory and eventually reload while processing crafted CIP packets over TCP when CIP is configured on an affected device.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets destined to TCP port 44818 on an affected device. UDP packets, packets transiting an affected device, or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 packets to TCP port 44818 on an affected device that is configured for CIP.      Successful establishment of a TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS Software may be affected if CIP is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. By default, CIP is not enabled in Cisco IOS Software.      To determine whether CIP is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include cip** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **cip enable** in the output of the **show running-config | include cip** command indicates that CIP is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include cip** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS Software with the CIP feature enabled:   ```   Switch# show running-config | include cip cip security password  cip enable   ```      **Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted CIP packets over TCP when CIP is configured on an affected device.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets destined to TCP port 44818 on an affected device. UDP packets, packets transiting an affected device, or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 packets to TCP port 44818 on an affected device that is configured for CIP.      Successful establishment of TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS Software for access points may be affected if CIP is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. By default, CIP is not enabled in Cisco IOS Software.      To determine whether CIP is enabled on an interface, use the **show running-config | include cip** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **cip enable** in the output of the **show running-config | include cip** command indicates that CIP is enabled.      The following is the output of the **show running-config | include cip** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS Software with the CIP feature enabled:   ```   Switch# show running-config | include cip cip security password  cip enable   ```    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated   ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.      Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) is an industrial protocol for industrial automation applications. It is supported by the Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA), an organization that supports network technologies based upon CIP such as DeviceNet, EtherNet/IP, CIP Safety, and CIP Sync. CIP uses UDP/TCP ports 44818 for explicit messaging and UDP port 2222 for implicit messaging.      **Cisco IOS Software UDP CIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed UDP packets directed at a CIP port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed UDP packets destined to a CIP port when CIP is enabled on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.         This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets destined to UDP ports 2222 or 44818 on an affected device. TCP packets, packets transiting an affected device, or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCum98371](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum98371) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0647.      **Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Packet Memory Leak Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of a sequence of TCP packets directed at a CIP port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of TCP packets destined to a CIP port when CIP is enabled on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.      This vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets destined to TCP port 44818 on an affected device. UDP packets, packets transiting an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCun49658](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun49658) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0648.      **Cisco IOS Software TCP CIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.
