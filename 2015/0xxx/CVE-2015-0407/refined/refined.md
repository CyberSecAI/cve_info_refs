Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0407:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content confirms that CVE-2015-0407 is related to a vulnerability in OpenJDK, specifically within the Swing component's file chooser implementation. This aligns with the official description for CVE-2015-0407.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the file chooser within the Swing component of OpenJDK handles directory information, allowing an untrusted application or applet to obtain file and directory information that should be restricted by the Java sandbox.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure flaw. An attacker can access directory contents that they should not normally have access to through the file chooser.
*   **Sandbox Bypass:** The vulnerability can bypass some Java sandbox restrictions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain knowledge of files present in a directory, potentially gaining information about the system's structure.
*   The vulnerability allows bypassing sandbox restrictions, potentially leading to further compromise of the system if combined with other vulnerabilities

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Java Applets/Web Start Applications:**  The primary attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability through untrusted Java applets or Java Web Start applications.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Code Execution**: The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious java applet or java web start application.
*   **No Authentication:** No specific authentication is required as the vulnerability is triggered by simply opening the file chooser in a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information from multiple sources (Gentoo, HP, RedHat, Ubuntu, SuSE, Oracle, VMware, etc.) highlights the widespread impact of the vulnerability and the need to patch various systems.
*   Several sources mention that this vulnerability is fixed in OpenJDK versions 6u91, 7u75, and 8u31 (and related IcedTea versions), which is valuable information when patching affected systems.
*   The `bugzilla.redhat.com` content provides specific details about the fix and related upstream commits, as well as links to advisories.
*   The `www.vmware.com` content explains the scope of the vulnerability and lists various affected Vmware products

In summary, CVE-2015-0407 is an information disclosure vulnerability in OpenJDK's Swing component that enables a remote attacker to gain knowledge of file paths by bypassing certain Java sandbox restrictions via a file chooser.
