Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Debian packaging for `smokeping` was flawed.
- The CGI implementation within Apache httpd (`mod_cgi`) was configured to pass additional arguments to the `smokeping_cgi` program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** The vulnerability allowed for the execution of arbitrary code due to the improper handling of arguments passed to the CGI script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could craft malicious HTTP requests that, when processed by the vulnerable `smokeping_cgi`, would lead to arbitrary code execution. This could result in complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP requests sent to the web server running smokeping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable smokeping instance. This implies network accessibility to the affected server.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-0859 describes a vulnerability in the Debian packaging of `smokeping` where incorrect CGI configuration exposed the system to arbitrary code execution. By sending crafted HTTP requests, an attacker could execute malicious code on the server. The advisory notes that the vulnerability is corrected in versions 2.6.8-2+deb7u1 for wheezy and 2.6.9-1+deb8u1 for jessie.
