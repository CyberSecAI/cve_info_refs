ICS Advisory
# Network Vision IntraVue Code Injection Vulnerability

Last RevisedAugust 29, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-15-057-01

## OVERVIEW

Researcher Jürgen Bilberger from Daimler TSS GmbH has identified a code injection vulnerability in Network Vision’s IntraVue software. Network Vision has produced a new version that mitigates this vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

## AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following IntraVue software versions are affected:

* IntraVue, all Windows versions prior to Version 2.3.0a14.

## IMPACT

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an affected server.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## BACKGROUND

Network Vision is a US-based company headquartered in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

The affected product, IntraVue, is a software package for network visualization. According to Network Vision, IntraVue is deployed across several sectors including Critical Manufacturing, Transportation Systems, and Water and Wastewater Systems. Network Vision estimates that these products are used globally with a significant portion in North America and Europe.

## VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZATION

### VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### OS COMMAND INJECTIONCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'), http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html, web site last accessed February 26, 2015.

The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary operating system commands on an affected server system.

CVE-2015-0977NVD, http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0977, NIST uses this advisory to create the CVE web site report.

## MITIGATION

Network Vision has released a new version of the IntraVues software that mitigates the code injection vulnerability. It is recommended that the new version be applied as soon as possible. Users who have software support contracts with Network Vision can upgrade to the newest version at no cost. For more information, please contact Network Vision:

Toll Free (US): (877) 499-8100

Phone: (978) 499-7800

Email: help@intravue.net

Additional mitigations could be implemented as interim prevention measures until the new version is applied. The following mitigations could be used to help limit the impact of the code injection vulnerability; however, the following suggestions may not be appropriate for all environments. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

* Isolate the vulnerable system from the Internet and untrusted systems; however, if connectivity is required, use a VPN solution and implement network monitoring.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
* Implement a runtime policy to prevent the use of any command that does not appear in a whitelist of allowable commands.
* Utilize good design practices that include network segmentation; use of DMZs with properly configured firewalls to selectively control traffic; and monitor traffic passed between zones and systems.
* If possible, create isolated accounts using lowest privileges to accomplish minimum required tasks.

ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT web page at: [http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf)

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS‑CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the ICS-CERT web site ([http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/](/ics/)).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
