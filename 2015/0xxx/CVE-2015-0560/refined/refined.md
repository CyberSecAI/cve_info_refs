Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) dissector within the Wireshark software. Specifically, the dissector does not handle certain malformed packets correctly, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed WCCP packets.
- Lack of input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a crash of the Wireshark application. This can interrupt network analysis activities.
- A successful attack can be triggered by either injecting malicious packets into a network being monitored by Wireshark or by opening a malicious capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Injection: Attacker injects specially crafted WCCP packets onto the network that Wireshark is monitoring.
- Malicious Capture Files: Attacker tricks a user into opening a capture file containing the malformed WCCP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For network injection: The attacker needs to be in a position to inject network traffic into the network being analyzed by the victim.
- For malicious capture files: The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in Wireshark versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.12.
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2015-0559 but is separate from it.
- The opensuse mailing list indicates that this CVE was part of a larger security update that fixed six vulnerabilities.
