- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of Velocity syntax within weblog page templates in Apache Roller allows for arbitrary Java code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unrestricted use of Velocity syntax by admin-level users.
    - Vulnerable versions of Apache Roller (5.1.1, 5.1, and likely pre-5.1).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin-level access can execute arbitrary Java code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin-level access to a weblog can edit the weblog's page templates and inject malicious Velocity syntax.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an admin-level user of a vulnerable Apache Roller weblog.
