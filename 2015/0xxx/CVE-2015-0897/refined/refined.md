Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The LINE application allowed non-SSL/TLS communication, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of secure communication protocols (non-SSL/TLS)
- Allowing arbitrary API invocation via injected scripts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A MITM attacker could inject malicious scripts into the communication stream.
- This injected script could be used to invoke any API within the LINE application.
- Potential for unauthorized access, modification of data (e.g., chat history, friend lists).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on unencrypted network traffic.
- Specifically targeting scenarios where users connect to untrusted Wi-Fi networks (e.g., malicious hotspots).
- Opening pages within the LINE app or accessing URLs in messages/timeline could trigger the vulnerability when connected to a malicious wifi network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the LINE app and the server (e.g., through a rogue Wi-Fi access point).
- Ability to perform a MITM attack.
- Ability to inject malicious scripts into the communication stream.

The provided information gives more detail than a typical CVE description, specifying that the vulnerability lies in the lack of SSL/TLS encryption, the attack vector is MITM via untrusted Wi-Fi and the impact includes potential data exfiltration and tampering.
