**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the Maroyaka Image Album CGI script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the context of a user's browser.
