{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection through the 'conditionXML' parameter in the Server Task Log feature when creating a custom filter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authenticated XXE vulnerability",
    "Use of a static key for encryption",
    "Weak encryption cipher (AES-128-ECB)",
    "Default SQL 'sa' user and application certificate keystore share the same password."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem using the XXE vulnerability, specifically the 'keystore.properties' file, which contains an encrypted passphrase. This passphrase can be decrypted due to weak encryption, revealing the password for the 'sa' SQL user and potentially the initial admin user, allowing remote command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator, specifically through the 'Server Task Log' feature when creating a custom filter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator."
