Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0079:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper memory management within the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Specifically, the issue arises when multiple RDP sessions are created, and the system fails to properly free objects in memory associated with these sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition triggered by the failure to deallocate memory used by RDP sessions. This leads to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the target system to stop responding. Legitimate users may be prevented from logging on through remote desktop. The vulnerability does not allow for code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple RDP sessions that do not properly release allocated memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need authentication to trigger this vulnerability. They need to be able to connect to the target system using RDP. The attacker needs to be able to initiate multiple RDP sessions.

**Additional Details:**
- RDP is not enabled by default on Windows systems. Systems without RDP enabled are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how RDP manages objects in memory.
- The affected systems include Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Window 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.
- Disabling RDP can serve as a workaround.
- For Windows 7, all supported editions are affected if RDP 8.0 is installed, otherwise only Enterprise and Ultimate editions are affected.
- It is recommended to upgrade to RDP 8.1 instead of applying the 3035017 update for Windows 7 users running RDP 8.0 locally that do not require server-side RDP 8.0 features.
