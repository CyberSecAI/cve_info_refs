Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-0214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that messaging-related functions in Moodle's web services did not properly check if messaging was enabled on the site before allowing access to these functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue was the lack of a check to verify if the messaging system was enabled before granting access to related functions via web services.
*   **Information Leakage:**  This allowed unauthorized access to messaging-related functionalities, potentially exposing user information that should have been restricted when messaging was disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access user information through messaging-related functions like "people search", even when messaging was disabled on the Moodle site. This could include details about users, which would otherwise be kept private when messaging is turned off.
*   **Minor Risk:** The severity was classified as minor, which indicates limited potential for direct harm to the system or its users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Services:**  The vulnerability was exploitable through Moodle's web services interface.
*   **Remote Access:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Service Access:** The attacker would need to be able to interact with Moodle's web services, which could be done using legitimate or crafted requests.
*   **No special privileges required:** An attacker did not require special privileges beyond what was required to use the webservices.
