  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2015-0023",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
      "root_cause": "Improper memory access when handling objects in memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website.",
         "The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities."
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or email message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email."
