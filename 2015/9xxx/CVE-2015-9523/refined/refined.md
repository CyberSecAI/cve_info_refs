Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` WordPress functions when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core issue is that if an attacker can control the third parameter (the URL) passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`, they can inject malicious URLs into the query string.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises because the application doesn't properly escape or sanitize the provided URL before using it in the query string. Specifically, the URL is not being passed through `esc_url()` to ensure it's a valid and safe URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Redirect to Malicious Sites:** An attacker could inject a malicious URL into the query string, which would then be used by the application. If the application redirects a user to that crafted URL, the attacker could then redirect the user to a phishing site, malware download, or other malicious resource.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulating URL Parameters:** Attackers could potentially manipulate query parameters, form data or any other user input that is later used to construct the URL which is then passed as the 3rd parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the third parameter that is passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- The attacker would need to identify a vulnerable endpoint where the application uses these functions with user-controlled input as the third parameter.
