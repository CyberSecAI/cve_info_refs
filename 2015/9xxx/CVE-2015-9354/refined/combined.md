Since the latest update of the plugin, users are no longer able to have their GigPress dates appear on top of a boxed background (which either makes the text blend in with the background photo, or forcing all other pages to be boxed & in no way manipulatable).
I love this app for keeping fans up-to-date on shows, past & present, but in recent times it’s been nearly unusable for myself & my fanbase.

Best concert listings plugin. Period.
Please keep Gigpress alive, it’s amazing in its versatility and quality. The visual customisations and backend exceed ANY other plugin out there so far.

I don’t know why everybody says it is “intuitive”, it is not. In order to change the style of it, you have to modify the .css file and upload it via .ftp. That takes extra time. Plus, the browsers take some time to register the changes, so you have to wait 10 minutes to see if the colors you chose are right. Then, you have to go through all the css styles, and find what you want to change, everything is explained but… it’s not intuitive at all.

Used it a number of times years ago, and glad to see it’s still around, stable, and gets the odd update since being taken over.
Would hate to see it disappear or become obsolete. Would 100% pay for it.
Well built, intuitive, and really useful.

I loved this plugin until I looked at my site today and the DATES were no longer on the listings!
Last support was a YEAR ago, so I am changing plugins.

GigPress is wonderful, but I can’t really rate it 5/5, because the default show listing isn’t responsive.
In order to make the show listing responsive, you need to do quite drastic changes to the templates. Not for the inexperienced.
I hope this will change, now that Modern Tribe is behind the wheel.
