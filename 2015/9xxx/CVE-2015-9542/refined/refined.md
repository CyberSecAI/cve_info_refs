{
  "CVE-2015-9542": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The `add_password` function in `pam_radius_auth.c` did not correctly check the length of the input password.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted long password to an application using the `libpam-radius-auth` library, causing it to crash (denial of service). In some circumstances, it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker sending a crafted password via network traffic to a system using the vulnerable libpam-radius-auth.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an application using the vulnerable library."
    },
    {
     "Root cause": "The `add_password` function in `pam_radius_auth.c` incorrectly copies the password without proper length validation, which could lead to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending a crafted password that overflows a buffer, leading to a crash of the application using the `libpam-radius-auth` library.",
     "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted network packet containing a password with excessive length to a service using pam_radius.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service."
