Package        : libpam-radius-auth
Version        : 1.3.16-5+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-9542
Debian Bug     : 951396

`add_password` in pam_radius_auth.c in pam_radius 1.4.0 does not
correctly check the length of the input password, and is vulnerable
to a stack-based buffer overflow during memcpy(). An attacker could
send a crafted password to an application (loading the pam_radius
library) and crash it. Arbitrary code execution might be possible,
depending on the application, C library, compiler, and other factors.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.3.16-5+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-radius-auth packages.

For the detailed security status of libpam-radius-auth please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libpam-radius-auth>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Best,
Utkarsh

Package        : libpam-radius-auth
Version        : 1.3.16-4.4+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-9542
Debian Bug     : 951396

A vulnerability was found in pam_radius: the password length check was
done incorrectly in the add_password() function in pam_radius_auth.c,
resulting in a stack based buffer overflow.

This could be used to crash (DoS) an application using the PAM stack
for authentication.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.3.16-4.4+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-radius-auth packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Best,
Utkarsh

This could be used to crash (DoS) an application using the PAM stack for authentication.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1686980#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-12 09:11:41 UTC  ``` Upstream fixes : <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius/commit/01173ec> <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius/commit/6bae92d> <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius/commit/ac2c1677>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1686980#c2)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-12 09:43:05 UTC  ``` Created pam_radius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1802060](show_bug.cgi?id=1802060 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-9542 pam_radius: buffer overflow in password field [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1686980#c3)  Alex Scheel    2020-02-12 13:28:47 UTC  ``` - Fixed in epel-8 since release, - Fixed in Fedora since pam_radius-1.4.0-14 (in Fedora 28), - Fixed in epel-7 since pam_radius-1.4.0-4.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1686980#c4)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-12 13:41:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  As shipped in epel-6, the gcc compiler opts for __memcpy_chk() [with the correct buffer length] to ensure that there is a crash instead of an an overflow.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
