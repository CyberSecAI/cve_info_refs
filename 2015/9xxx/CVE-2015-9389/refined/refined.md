The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the mTouch Quiz WordPress plugin.

**Vulnerability 1: Reflected XSS on Quiz Manage**

*   **Root cause:**  The "quiz" parameter in the URL was not properly sanitized.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Attack vector:**  Maliciously crafted URL containing XSS payload in the `quiz` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Ability to create a malicious URL and lure a user to click on it.

**Vulnerability 2: CSRF on General Options**

*   **Root cause:** Missing security tokens (like wp_nonce) in the plugin's general options form.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of CSRF protection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can forge requests to change the plugin's general settings on behalf of an authenticated admin.
*  **Attack vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form with hidden fields to change plugin options and tricks an authenticated admin user into visiting a malicious web page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create a malicious HTML form and lure an authenticated admin to visit it.

**Vulnerability 3: Add a question using CSRF and get a persistent XSS**

*   **Root cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in the question creation form and insufficient input validation.
*   **Weakness:** CSRF vulnerability leading to persistent XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can add a malicious question containing an XSS payload. When an admin views the quiz question the malicious script will execute. This could lead to a variety of issues, including malware distribution and admin takeover.
*   **Attack vector:**  Malicious HTML form that adds a question containing an XSS payload to the quiz, requiring an authenticated user to visit the crafted page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create a malicious HTML form and lure an authenticated admin to visit it.

**Vulnerability 4: Quiz Name XSS**

*   **Root cause:** Inadequate sanitization of the quiz name input.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation leading to persistent XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject an XSS payload into the quiz name, which will be executed when the quiz is viewed.
*   **Attack vector:**  Maliciously crafted quiz name containing an XSS payload.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to modify a quiz name, which might be accessible by users with lower privileges depending on plugin settings.

The vendor patched these vulnerabilities in version 3.1.3, and credited David Sopas for reporting them. The plugin was later closed due to security issues.
