{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in the V8 JavaScript engine causes certain dates to raise exceptions instead of returning an `Invalid Date` object when parsed using the `Date` constructor. This happens with specific date strings, like '275760-09-24'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The node-ecstatic library does not handle the exception thrown by the Date constructor, leading to a crash.",
      "Improper error handling when parsing the `If-Modified-Since` header."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can crash the node-ecstatic server by sending a crafted `If-Modified-Since` header, which causes a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP request with a malicious `If-Modified-Since` header containing a date string that triggers the V8 bug.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server running node-ecstatic."
  }
