{
  "CVE-2015-9016": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the multiqueue block layer (blk-mq) when retrieving a request from a tag within a timeout handler.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `blk_mq_tag_to_rq()` function was retrieving a request based on a tag, which could be freed at any time, leading to accessing potentially invalid memory. Additionally, the flush request could share the same tag as a cloned request, leading to further race conditions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could potentially trigger a kernel oops or achieve a denial of service. Privilege escalation may also be possible.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by interacting with drivers using the blk-mq framework (e.g., mtip32xx, null_blk, or virtio_blk) and triggering a timeout, which will try to access a potentially freed request.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access is required to interact with the vulnerable drivers and trigger the timeout mechanism."
  },
  "CVE-2017-15265": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the ALSA (sound) sequencer core between the creation and deletion of a port via ioctl. The `snd_seq_create_port()` function creates a port object and returns a pointer without increasing its reference count, so the port could be deleted immediately by another thread while the original thread still attempts to use it.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability because the port object could be freed by another thread before it is fully initialized or used by the creating thread. This involves insufficient synchronization and improper reference counting.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with access to a sequencer device could cause a kernel crash (use-after-free) or potentially achieve privilege escalation.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by concurrently creating and deleting a port via ioctl. Specifically, `snd_seq_ioctl_create_port()` calls `snd_seq_create_port()`, and then uses the returned pointer which may have already been deleted. Also, there is another use-after-free by sprintf call in `snd_seq_create_port()`, and this is moved inside the lock",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access with access to a sound sequencer device."
