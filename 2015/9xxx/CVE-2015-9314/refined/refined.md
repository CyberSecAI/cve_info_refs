The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "NewStatPress" and mentions multiple vulnerabilities, but it does not contain specific information about **CVE-2015-9314**. However, it does contain information about other vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the changelog:

**1. SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities (Fixed in version 1.0.5):**
   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities were present in the old StatPress routine related to image tags.
   - **Weakness:**  Unsanitized user inputs leading to SQL injection and XSS.
   - **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution via SQL injection or execution of malicious JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).
   - **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious code into image tags.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the image tag.

**2. Reflected XSS vulnerability (Fixed in version 1.0.6):**
  - **Root Cause:** The plugin had a reflected XSS vulnerability.
  - **Weakness:** Unsanitized input being reflected back to the user.
  - **Impact:** Could lead to execution of malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
  - **Attack Vector:**  An attacker could craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript.
  - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**3. Persistent XSS via HTTP-Header (Referer) (Fixed in version 1.0.4):**
   - **Root Cause:** The plugin had a vulnerability related to the handling of the Referer HTTP header.
   - **Weakness:** The plugin was not sanitizing the Referer HTTP header, leading to persistent XSS.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript through the Referer header, which would be executed when a user accessed the site.
   - **Attack Vector:**  An attacker would need to send a request to the website with a malicious Referer header.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker could perform this action without any authentication.

**4. SQL Injection vulnerability (Fixed in version 1.0.1):**
   - **Root Cause:** The plugin had an SQL injection vulnerability within the old Statpress search code, which wasn't fully sanitized.
   - **Weakness:** Unsanitized user inputs were being used in SQL queries.
   - **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution via SQL injection.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious SQL injection in search queries.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious SQL through the search functionality.

**5. XSS and SQL Injection (Fixed in version 0.9.9):**
   - **Root Cause:** The old Statpress search routine had XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Weakness:** Unsanitized user inputs in search routine.
  - **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution via SQL injection, and malicious JavaScript execution.
  - **Attack Vectors:** Malicious input into the search functionality.
  - **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code through the search routine.

**6. Stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (Fixed in version 1.2.5):**
   - **Root Cause:** The plugin had stored XSS vulnerabilities.
   - **Weakness:** Unsanitized user inputs in the plugin configuration or data.
   - **Impact:** Could lead to execution of malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious JavaScript stored in the plugin database, which is then rendered in user's browser.
  - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to manipulate stored data, usually requires admin access.

**7. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Fixed in version 1.3.6):**
    -  **Root Cause:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
    - **Weakness:** Unsanitized input reflected back to the user.
    -  **Impact:** Malicious JavaScript execution within a user's browser.
    -  **Attack Vector:**  Malicious URLs with injected JavaScript.
    -  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**8. Potential SQL Injection (Addressed in versions 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5):**
    - **Root Cause:** The plugin contained potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Weakness:** Insufficient sanitization of user input.
    - **Impact:** Could allow attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or arbitrary code execution.
    - **Attack Vector:** Injection of malicious SQL code through various input parameters.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to inject SQL code into various input fields.

The content highlights a history of security issues within the NewStatPress plugin, mainly stemming from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied inputs, leading to XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. The changelog also shows the plugin developers actively addressing security issues and improving input sanitization.
