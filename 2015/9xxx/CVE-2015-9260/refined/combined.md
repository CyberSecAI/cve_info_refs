[`ed2e47c`](/bedita/bedita/commit/ed2e47c5ff5ff9dc843caf39d20ef6b830b14bd3)

We are happy to announce the immediate availability of BEdita 3.7.0 corylus\*.

All 3.6.0 instances should be upgraded to this last stable version. For this version a lot of work has been done under the hood so you wouldn't see many cosmetic changes.

Main changes are:

* fix XSS vulnerability adding contents in Publications module [#755](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/755). Many thanks to **Arjun** from [Cyber Security Works Pvt Ltd](http://cybersecurityworks.com)
* improved REST API adding several functionality like

  + get collection of objects and posters by comma separated id [#765](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/765), [#767](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/767)
  + filter objects by URL query string [#744](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/744)
  + ability to customize the URL query string supported for every endpoint
  + show all custom properties also those not populated [#763](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/763)
  + saving custom properties [#761](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/761)
  + ability to request objects related embedded in main objects data [#768](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/768)
* improved the calendar view in Events module
* if you need to handle events' dates before 1000 AD now you can [#670](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/670).

  If `date_items` is empty simply alter table changing `start_date` and `end_date` to BIGINT. If you have data in `date_items` you need to follow the instructions you can see launching the shell script

  ```
  $ cd /path/to/bedita
  $ ./cake.sh migration_date_items help
  ```
* added [Redis](http://redis.io) support for caching [#746](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/746).

  Once you have Redis installed you can configure it as

  ```
  Cache::config('redis_cache_name', array(
      'engine' => 'Redis',
      'prefix' => 'myapp_',
      'duration' => '+1 hour',
  ));
  ```
* easily use of avatars via [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com) service with the new `Gravatar` helper [#766](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/issues/766)

  ```
  // with BEdita user
  echo $gravatar->image($user);

  // go directly with email
  echo $gravatar->image('test@example.com');
  ```

See also the [changelog](https://github.com/bedita/bedita/blob/3-corylus/CHANGES.md#version-370---corylus) for all changes.

Moreover you can find a new documentation about REST API at <http://bedita.readthedocs.org>

# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2015-9260 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in BEdita

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### BEdita

#### Affected Product

##### BEdita

#### CVE

##### CVE-2015-9260

#### Securin ID

##### 2015-CSW-10-1010

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### October 14, 2015

### Description

A cross-site scripting vulnerability wasÂ identified on the Bedita CMS 3.6.0 Publication module. An XSS attack occurs via a crafted pages/showObjects URI, as demonstrated by appending a payload to a pages/showObjects/2/0/0/leafs URI.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

Issue:Â The POST request URL <http://192.168.56.104/bedita/beditaapp/pages/showObjects/2/0/0/leafs> of Bedita CMS 3.6.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(5).png)

***Figure 01: XSS Payload injected in the given URL <http://192.168.56.104/bedita/beditaapp/pages/showObjects/2/0/0/leafs> is reflected back in the response.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(4).png)

***Figure 02: XSS Payload gets executed in the browser.***

### Impact

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim’s browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can: Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. View any information that the user is able to view. Modify any information that the user is able to modify. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.

### Remediations

Download the latest updated version ofÂ  Bedita and apply the update as per vendor advisory.

### Timeline

**OctÂ 14, 2015:** Reported to Vendor

**OctÂ 14, 2015:** Vendor Responded

**OctÂ 15, 2015:** Vendor Responded “Under Investigation”

**Oct 31, 2015:**Â Follow up Email

**Dec 11, 2015:**Â Vendor Released Fixed

**Apr 07, 2018:** CVE Assigned
