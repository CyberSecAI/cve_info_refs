Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the BEdita CMS 3.6.0 Publication module. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how the application handles the `pages/showObjects` URI, particularly when appending a payload to a URI like `/pages/showObjects/2/0/0/leafs`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `pages/showObjects` URI. As a result, malicious JavaScript code embedded within the URI is reflected back in the response and executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the victim's browser session, allowing them to:
  - Perform any action the user can perform within the application.
  - View any information the user is authorized to see.
  - Modify any information the user is authorized to modify.
  - Initiate interactions with other application users, making them appear to come from the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code. The attacker would need to entice a user to click or otherwise load the crafted URL. This could be achieved via a phishing email or malicious link.
- The specific vulnerable URL is in the format: `<http://192.168.56.104/bedita/beditaapp/pages/showObjects/2/0/0/leafs>` with an XSS payload appended to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and distribute it to potential victims. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker does not require any access to the server, instead they rely on users of the BEdita application clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Arjun Basnet from Cyber Security Works Pvt Ltd.
- The issue was reported to the vendor on October 14, 2015, and a fix was released on December 11, 2015.
- The vulnerability affects BEdita CMS version 3.6.0.
