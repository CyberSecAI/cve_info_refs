Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9098:

**Description of Vulnerability:**

CVE-2015-9098 describes a security vulnerability in Redgate Monitor that allows an attacker with network access to the web application or Base Monitor components to access information or perform actions without authorization.  Specifically, the connection between the Redgate Monitor web application and the Base Monitor service can be compromised, circumventing the user role authentication mechanism.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication mechanism between the Redgate Monitor web application and the Base Monitor service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass that allows unauthorized access to Redgate Monitor's data and functionality.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Exploitation grants access to any data collected by Redgate Monitor.  This could include privileged data present in query fragments from Deadlock alerts, Long Running Query alerts, or SQL Server Error Log alerts.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution (Redgate Monitor v3.0 or later):**  The *Custom Metrics* feature can be abused to run arbitrary T-SQL statements on a monitored server.
*   **Credential Exposure:** A malicious endpoint attack can reveal SMTP credentials or expose SQL Server and machine credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data collected by Redgate Monitor.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In Redgate Monitor v3.0 and later, attackers can execute arbitrary T-SQL commands, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or even operating system command execution if SQL Server is configured with sufficient privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By executing arbitrary SQL commands, attackers can potentially elevate their privileges on the monitored SQL Server instances.
*   **System Compromise:** If the Base Monitor uses an account with SQL admin privileges, and MS SQL is running with Windows administrator rights, code execution on the operating system can result in full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromising the Connection:** The attacker compromises the connection between the Redgate Monitor web application and the Base Monitor service.
*   **Malicious Endpoint:** A determined attacker can create a malicious endpoint (e.g., a custom client, server, or proxy) to gain access to additional data communicated to, and stored by, a vulnerable Base Monitor service.
*   **Custom Metrics Abuse (v3.0+):** Attackers can leverage the custom metrics feature to inject and execute arbitrary T-SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to either the Redgate Monitor web application (default TCP port 8080) or the Base Monitor component (default TCP port 7399).
*   **Knowledge of the System:** Fingerprint the Red-Gate SQL monitor version on the target machine, by examining the web page source code on the log in page. E.g. "/static/4.1.0.2226/Content/RedGate.Response.css" implies version 4.1.0.2226.
*   **Ability to Intercept/Impersonate:**  The attacker needs the ability to intercept or impersonate communication between the web application and the Base Monitor, or to create a malicious endpoint that can communicate with the Base Monitor.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade Redgate Monitor to version 3.10 or 4.2 (or later).
*   If upgrading is not immediately feasible, restrict network access to the Base Monitor's port (default 7399) to only allow connections from the Redgate Monitor web server.  Note that Redgate does not provide support for firewall configuration.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All released versions of Redgate Monitor prior to v3.10 and v4.2 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, Redgate, discovered the vulnerability internally and is not aware of any instances of it being exploited in the wild.
*   The exploit details provided show how an attacker can fingerprint the version and then configure a test system to connect to the target Base Monitor without authentication.
