# Security vulnerability in Redgate Monitor

## 27th May 2015

We recently discovered a security vulnerability in Redgate Monitor.

This issue has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID [CVE-2015-9098](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9098).

This vulnerability would have made it possible for an attacker with network access to the web application or Base Monitor components of Redgate Monitor to access information or perform actions without authorization.

This discovery was made in-house: we don't have any examples of anyone exploiting this vulnerability.

We're really sorry this has happened. We're continuing to work with security experts to make sure we handle this incident in the safest way possible for our customers and users.

## What is the vulnerability?

We have discovered that the connection between the Redgate Monitor web application and the Base Monitor service can be compromised.

## Am I affected?

This vulnerability exists in all released versions of Redgate Monitor.

Note that this vulnerability does not exist in SQL Response, an older monitoring product that has been retired.

## How could this be exploited?

An attacker could circumvent Redgate Monitorâs user role authentication mechanism (as described at [https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/SM4/Managing+user+roles](https://documentation.red-gate.com/display/SM4/Managing%2Buser%2Broles)).

* This would provide an unauthorized user with access to any data collected by Redgate Monitor. Depending on the database design, query fragments collected by Deadlock alerts, Long Running Query alerts, or SQL Server Error Log alerts could contain privileged data.
* Additionally, for Redgate Monitor v3.0 or later, the *Custom Metrics* feature could allow an attacker to run any T-SQL statement on a monitored server. This could allow someone to change or delete data or databases on the monitored server.

A determined attacker could create a malicious endpoint (e.g. a custom client, server, or proxy) to gain access to additional data communicated to and stored by a vulnerable Base Monitor service.

* This could reveal the SMTP credentials, which could lead to further exploit if these are reused elsewhere.
* The SQL Server and machine credentials used by the Base Monitor service are stored encrypted in the Data Repository; however, if credentials were entered into the Redgate Monitor web application during an ongoing malicious endpoint attack, these could be visible to an attacker.
* **Note: due to the nature of the vulnerability, it is very unlikely that an attacker could divine the mechanism by which they could launch a malicious endpoint attack.**

## Further mitigating factors

The following are additional mitigating factors:

* For exploits against the Base Monitor, the attacker would need to be able to communicate with the Base Monitor component of Redgate Monitor, which listens by default on TCP port 7399.
* For exploits against the web application, the attacker would need to be able to communicate with the web application component of Redgate Monitor, which listens by default on TCP port 8080 when running under Redgate Monitorâs built-in web server.
* For either exploit, this typically means that an attacker would either need to be on your network, or would need to circumvent your normal network security mechanisms such as firewalls.
## How can I resolve this vulnerability?

We have made fixes available in both the v3 and v4 release streams of Redgate Monitor.

[Download Redgate Monitor v3.10](https://download.red-gate.com/checkforupdates/SQLMonitorWeb/SQLMonitorWeb_3.10.1.25.exe) [Download Redgate Monitor v4.2](https://download.red-gate.com/checkforupdates/SQLMonitorWeb/SQLMonitorWeb_4.2.0.243.exe)

Any Redgate Monitor customer can upgrade to either of these releases, regardless of their support status.

**Note: Under some circumstances, the Redgate Monitor installer can report an error message "Port is not available". If you encounter this error, you will need to stop the Redgate Monitor Windows services before you run the installation.**

1. From the Start Menu, open `services.msc`.
2. Locate the services named "`Redgate Monitor [*] Base Service`" (and, if you're using Redgate Monitor's own web server "`Redgate Monitor [*] Web Service`") - where `[*]` stands for the version you have installed.
3. Right click on each of these services and select "Stop".
4. Re-run the installer.

If you are unable to upgrade Redgate Monitor, then you could instead secure the port on the machine running the Base Monitor, to only allow connections from the web server running the Redgate Monitor web application. The port used is configured during installation: the default port is 7399, but you can check this via the Redgate Monitor UI (go to *Configuration* -> *About*).

**Please note that, due to the wide variety of firewall technologies, Redgate cannot offer customer support on firewall configuration settings.**

## Are there any implications of upgrading to Redgate Monitor v4.2?

For Redgate Monitor v4 customers upgrading to Redgate Monitor v4.2:

* There are no performance implications.
* There are no data collection or storage change implications.
* If you upgrade from a version earlier than v4.1.1, there are schema changes associated with upgrading to Redgate Monitor v4.2. Before you upgrade to a later version, we recommend that you back up your current Data Repository. Once the upgrade is completed, you won't be able to roll back to a previous version of your Data Repository database.

For Redgate Monitor v2 or v3 customers, upgrading to Redgate Monitor v4.2:

* There may be a small additional performance load (up to 10%) on the machine running the Base Monitor service.
* There is a small (less than 10%) increase in the rate of data collection, and in storage requirements for the Data Repository.
* There are schema changes associated with upgrading to Redgate Monitor v4.2. Before you upgrade to a later version, we recommend that you back up your current Data Repository. Once the upgrade is completed, you won't be able to roll back to a previous version of your Data Repository database.

## Are there any implications of upgrading to Redgate Monitor v3.10?

For Redgate Monitor v3 customers upgrading to Redgate Monitor v3.10:

* There are no performance implications.
* There are no data collection or storage change implications.
* There are no schema change implications.

For Redgate Monitor v2 customers, upgrading to Redgate Monitor v3.10:

* There are no performance implications.
* There are no data collection or storage change implications.
* There are schema changes associated with upgrading to Redgate Monitor v3.10. Before you upgrade to a later version, we recommend that you back up your current Data Repository. Once the upgrade is completed, you won't be able to roll back to a previous version of your Data Repository database.

# Exploit Title: Red-Gate SQL Monitor authentication bypass
# Version: Redgate SQL Monitor before 3.10 and 4.x before 4.2
# Date: 2017-08-10
# Red-Gate made a security announcement and publicly released the fixed version more than two years before this exploit was published
# Vendor Advisory: http://www.red-gate.com/products/dba/sql-monitor/entrypage/security-vulnerability
# Software Link: ftp://support.red-gate.com/patches/SqlMonitorWeb/09Apr2015/SQLMonitorWeb.exe
# Exploit Author: Paul Taylor / Foregenix Ltd
# Website: http://www.foregenix.com/blog
# Tested on: SQLMonitor 4.1.2.404, SQLMonitor 4.1.0.2226
# CVE: CVE-2015-9098

1. Description

A remote attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the Base Monitor, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on any monitored Microsoft SQL Server machines. If the Base Monitor is connecting to these machines using an account with SQL admin privileges, then code execution on the operating system can result in full system compromise (if Microsoft SQL Server is running with local administrator privileges).

2. Proof of Concept

Fingerprint the Red-Gate SQL monitor version on the target machine, by examining the web page source code on the log in page. E.g. "/static/4.1.0.2226/Content/RedGate.Response.css" implies version 4.1.0.2226.

Download and install the corresponding version of SQL monitor on a test VM. Microsoft SQL Express can be used to get base monitor to work properly, and test out the functionality. Connect the SQL monitor and base monitor together on your test VM machine and log in.

Then browse to "Configuration / Base Monitor connection" and update the Base Monitor computer details to a different Base Monitor IP address and Port number (on the target or victim machine). Click "Change connection". Now you will be connecting to the target Base Monitor without authentication, but with full privileges.

Use Configuration / Custom-metrics / Create, and then provide a Metric name and Description, and enter a T-SQL query. If Base Monitor is running with SQL admin rights, and MS SQL is running with Windows administrator rights, then the following will work:

EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
RECONFIGURE with override;
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
RECONFIGURE with override;
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net user testuser MyLongPassword_1 /add'
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net localgroup administrators testuser /add'

Select a SQL server instance (or all instances), and then select "Specify databases" and type: master
Click "Test metric collection."
In the popup dialog, ensure the desired instances are ticked, and then click "Test metric collection".

This will execute your SQL query with the rights of the Base Monitor SQL user, and any xp_cmdshell with the rights of the service account in use by MSSQL.

The return value will contain an error, because the result is not an integer, but you should be able to see some of the xp_cmdshell command response in the error, e.g. "Unable to convert.... The command completed successfully"

3. Solution:

Update to latest version of Red-Gate SQL monitor

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
