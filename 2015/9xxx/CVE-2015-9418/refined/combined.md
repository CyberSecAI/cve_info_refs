## Advisory:

# CSRF in Watu PRO allows unauthenticated attackers to delete quizzes

## Vulnerability

Last revised: August 11, 2015

An attacker able to convince an admin to visit a link of their choosing is able to delete quizzes.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 4.3 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | None |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | None |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

Assuming there is a quiz with ID 1, the following link will delete it when visited by a logged-in admin:

http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=watupro\_exams&action=delete&quiz=1

## Advisory timeline

* 2015-08-11: Discovered
* 2015-08-11: Reported to Author via email
* 2015-08-11: Author responded
* 2015-08-26: Author reported fixed in version 4.9.0.8
* 2015-09-01: Published

## Mitigation/further actions

This issue has been discussed with the author, who disagrees that there is an exploitable issue. We maintain that the above proof of concept demonstrates this issue. Nonetheless, the author has told us that they have made changes to address the problem in version 4.9.0.8 of this plugin. We have not verified these changes, so our recommendation is to upgrade to version 4.9.0.8 or later, and ideally conduct your own security assessment of this plugin.
