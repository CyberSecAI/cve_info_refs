Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9418 (Note: The dxw advisory incorrectly states the CVE as CVE-2015-6741, this has been corrected below)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Watu PRO plugin for WordPress lacked proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection when deleting quizzes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin's delete quiz functionality was vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This means an attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally deleting quizzes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Quiz Deletion:** An attacker could delete quizzes from the WordPress site without being authenticated. This could lead to loss of data and potential disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attack requires an attacker to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in administrator to click it.
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, as the malicious link would be visited via the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to convince a logged-in admin user to click on a malicious link they provide.
- **Targeted Admin User:** The victim must be a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates a malicious link that will delete a quiz with ID 1: `http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=watupro_exams&action=delete&quiz=1`
- The vulnerability was reported to the plugin author and supposedly addressed in version 4.9.0.8. However, the reporting entity did not verify the fix and recommended a security audit.
- The vulnerability was present in Watu PRO version 4.8.8.4
- The CVSS score was deemed a medium severity due to the requirement of social engineering and partial impact on Integrity. Availability was deemed none as the site itself isn't impacted

**Note:** The dxw advisory states "We maintain that the above proof of concept demonstrates this issue. Nonetheless, the author has told us that they have made changes to address the problem in version 4.9.0.8 of this plugin." This suggests there may have been some disagreement on the validity of the CSRF vulnerability but the author still implemented changes to address the concerns.
