Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress. Specifically, when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL, it creates a security risk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization when constructing URLs using `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`. If a malicious URL is inserted as the third parameter, it could lead to unintended redirects or other malicious behavior.
- **Unescaped URLs:** The functions themselves are not inherently vulnerable. The problem lies in the fact that the third parameter accepts unescaped URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Redirects:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL, inject it into the vulnerable parameter, and redirect users to a phishing or malware-laden website.
- **Potential for Other Attacks:** Depending on how the crafted URL is processed by the application or user's browser, other attacks might be possible, although not explicitly described.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate URLs by injecting a malicious redirect or other harmful URL as a parameter.
- **Third-Party Input:** If the URL being used with `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` originates from external user inputs or other untrusted sources and is not properly escaped, it introduces a vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** An attacker would need to identify instances where the vulnerable functions are used with user-controlled input or where unescaped URLs are used as a parameter.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs that can cause harm upon redirect or when executed by the user's browser.
- **Access to Affected System:** An attacker can be a user of the website or can use crafted URLs in social engineering campaigns targeting users of the site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post mentions that this was an automatically deployed update, which mitigates risk by proactively patching systems.
- The discussion in comments indicates that the vulnerability is not in all uses of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`, only when the third parameter is an unescaped URL.
- The comment thread explicitly mentions that `esc_url()` should be used to sanitize such URLs before passing them to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
