# WordPress Users Ultra Plugin [Blind SQL injection]

---

*From*: pan.vagenas () gmail com

```
* Exploit Title: WordPress Users Ultra Plugin [Blind SQL injection]
* Discovery Date: 2015/10/19
* Public Disclosure Date: 2015/12/01
* Exploit Author: Panagiotis Vagenas
* Contact: <https://twitter.com/panVagenas>
* Vendor Homepage: <http://usersultra.com>
* Software Link: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/users-ultra/>
* Version: 1.5.50
* Tested on: WordPress 4.3.1
* Category: webapps

Description
================================================================================

One can perform an SQL injection attack simply by exploiting the following WP ajax actions:

1. `edit_video`
2. `delete_photo`
3. `delete_gallery`
4. `delete_video`
5. `reload_photos`
6. `edit_gallery`
7. `edit_gallery_confirm`
8. `edit_photo`
9. `edit_photo_confirm`
10. `edit_video_confirm`
11. `set_as_main_photo`
12. `sort_photo_list`
13. `sort_gallery_list`
14. `reload_videos`

POST parameters that are exploitable in each action respectively:

1. `video_id`
2. `photo_id`
3. `gal_id`
4. `video_id`
5. `gal_id`
6. `gal_id`
7. `gal_id`
8. `photo_id`
9. `photo_id`
10. `video_id`
11. `photo_id`, `gal_id`
12. `order`
13. `order`
14. `video_id`

In case #7 a user can also change the gallery name, description and visibility by setting POST parameters `gal_name`,
`gal_desc` and `gal_visibility` respectively.

In case #8 `photo_id` is first casted to integer and a query to DB is performed. If results are returned then for each
result a new query is performed without casting the `photo_id` to integer. So if an attacker knows a valid video id
then it can perform the attack in the second query. This achievable because `<?php (int)'1 and sleep(5)' === 1; ?>

In case #9 a user can also change the photo name, description, tags and category by setting POST parameters
`photo_name`, `photo_desc`, `photo_tags` and `photo_category` respectively.

In case #10 a user can also change the video name, unique id and type by setting POST parameters `video_name`,
`video_unique_id` and `video_type` respectively.

Because function wpdb::get_results() and wpdb::query() are in use here, only one SQL statement can be made per request.
This holds severity of the attack low.
In addition all actions are privileged so the user must have an active account in vulnerable website, in order to
perform the attack.

PoC
================================================================================

Send a post request to `[http://my.vulnerable.website.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`](http://my.vulnerable.website.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php%60) with data:
`action=edit_video&video_id=1 and sleep(5) `

Timeline

When I am logged out and click on ”see profile” ( profile of another member ) tells me to login/sign in, which is fine, even tho I might not want to have it set it up that way.
I login and I click on a profile ( again, not my profile) and I am redirected to my profile, therefore, I can not see members profiles, which again, I actually don’t need members to not see other members profiles.
I would appreciate a solution to this please.

In October 2020, we tried out the free version of Users Ultra. A pre-sales enquiry we made was answered within a few hours, so we were assumed that there was a robust support mechanism behind the software. We purchased the Pro version on the strength of the answer to our pre-sales question.
However, once we had purchased and installed the Pro version of Users Ultra, we found that it did not function correctly on our site. We therefore requested assistance by logging a technical support ticket with Users Ultra. Our support ticket went unanswered and so six days later we resubmitted it. This support request too went unanswered and so we requested a refund under the terms of their 30-day money back guarantee. Perhaps not surprisingly, this request was ignored as well.
We now had three open tickets on our Users Ultra account and, because it turns out that this is the maximum number of open requests you can have, we could no longer contact them through this route. We tried emailing directly to the technician that had given us the initial pre-sales support but, again, heard nothing back.
Fortunately, we had taken screenshots of the support section of our Users Ultra account showing the dates of our last three support tickets (those logged since paying Users Ultra and including the refund request) and that they were all still showing as “Unassigned”. As we had used a credit card to make the purchase, we were able to send those screenshots to our card supplier as proof of the lack of support and claim our money back.

We paid for a PRO version and now 16 months later we can’t get ANY support. Have an open ticket for 3 weeks now and no response. We simply updated our WP to latest and stuff is broken now.
I’d be happy to rereview this plugin if anyone would ever contact me because we like the functionality, but if I can’t get support my site is down

Purchased their ultimate package. Does not work, no support or response after trying to get it to work for over a year. I would give it zero stars if I could.

Thank you for free use this plugin.
Please fix it compatibily with WP5.5/JQuery migrate. The issue is:
users-ultra/admin/scripts/admin.js:26:36): jQuery.fn.live() is deprecated
[..]
“users-ultra/admin/scripts/admin.js:659:49): jQuery.fn.live() is deprecated”
Recommends for fix:
$(‘.myButton’).live(‘click’, function)
replcae to:
$(‘#parentElement’).on(‘click’, ‘.myButton’, function)
