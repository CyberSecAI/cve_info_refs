Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the WordPress Users Ultra plugin. Specifically, several AJAX actions in the plugin directly use POST parameters in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through various POST parameters (`video_id`, `photo_id`, `gal_id`, `order`) used in AJAX actions. This allows an attacker to interact with the database in a way that was not intended.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize input parameters before using them in SQL queries. This is the primary cause of the SQL injection vulnerability.
*  **Type Casting Bypass:** The vulnerability is exacerbated in the `edit_photo` action where, even though a `photo_id` is initially cast as an integer, a subsequent query uses the same `photo_id` *without* type casting if the first query returns a result, enabling SQL injection if the attacker knows a valid ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** While the attack is limited to a single SQL statement per request, by chaining multiple requests an attacker might gain more significant control over the system if used to exfiltrate admin user information and then authenticate with it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable AJAX Actions:** The following AJAX actions are susceptible to SQL injection: `edit_video`, `delete_photo`, `delete_gallery`, `delete_video`, `reload_photos`, `edit_gallery`, `edit_gallery_confirm`, `edit_photo`, `edit_photo_confirm`, `edit_video_confirm`, `set_as_main_photo`, `sort_photo_list`, `sort_gallery_list`, and `reload_videos`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an active account with privileges on the vulnerable WordPress website, as these AJAX actions are privileged.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable POST parameters and AJAX actions.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit author noted that due to the use of `wpdb::get_results()` and `wpdb::query()`, only one SQL statement can be executed per request, which limits the severity of the attack to some degree.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description would provide and clearly outlines the mechanics of the SQL injection vulnerability within the WordPress Users Ultra plugin.
