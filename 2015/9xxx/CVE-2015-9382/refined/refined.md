  "description": "freetype: mishandling ps_parser_skip_PS_token in an FT_New_Memory_Face operation in skip_comment, psaux/psobjs.c, leads to a buffer over-read",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from mishandling the `ps_parser_skip_PS_token` function within the `skip_comment` function in `psaux/psobjs.c` during an `FT_New_Memory_Face` operation. Specifically, a lack of proper validation in `ps_parser_skip_PS_token()` allows the reading cursor to move beyond the end of the text content when handling PostScript balanced expressions. This leads to an out-of-bounds read in the `skip_comment()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a crafted font file that, when processed by FreeType, causes an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or low confidentiality impact through exposure of unexpected data. In particular, the over-read may expose unexpected data in memory.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "A crafted font file is provided to the vulnerable function"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted font file to be processed by FreeType library.",
    "affected_components": [
        "FreeType library (versions prior to 2.6.1)",
        "psaux/psobjs.c: `ps_parser_skip_PS_token`, `skip_comment`"
        ]
  },
    "affected_systems":[
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
      "Ubuntu 14.04 ESM",
      "Ubuntu 12.04 ESM"
    ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is located in the `psaux/psobjs.c` file, specifically within the `ps_parser_skip_PS_token` and `skip_comment` functions, and can be triggered when opening a font using `FT_New_Memory_Face`. The fix involves ensuring that the cursor position does not exceed the limit when a token is enclosed in balanced expressions."
