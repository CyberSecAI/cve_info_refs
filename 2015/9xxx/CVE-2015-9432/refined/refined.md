Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9432 (based on the provided content, the content references a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in "Alpine PhotoTile for Instagram" which aligns with CVE-2015-9432)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `tab` parameter within the plugin's settings page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the `tab` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including:
    - Stealing session cookies and other sensitive information
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is a crafted URL with malicious script in the `tab` parameter. The attacker would need to lure a logged-in administrator to click the link or otherwise have the vulnerable URL loaded in their browser.
- **GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter is part of a GET request, making the attack vector relatively easy to exploit by crafting a malicious URL.
- **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is found within the admin panel, indicating that only authenticated administrators are vulnerable

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and how to inject malicious code.
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The plugin version affected is 1.2.7.5
- The vulnerable parameter is `tab`
- The vulnerability is located in `alpinebot-admin.php` file at line 793 in the function `PhotoTileForInstagramAdmin::admin_build_settings_page`
- The vulnerability exists because there is no CSRF protection to prevent the injection.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download.
