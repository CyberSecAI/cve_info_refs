Love this plugin, but it will break your site if you upgrade to php 7.0 since it uses the deprecated function ereg\_replace.
Has anyone made a nice fork that I can use instead?

Sad to say this plugin is no longer maintained. It was intuitive and really user friendly. Alpine Press maintenance is missing. Please keep up the good work! üôÇ

This is by far the best Instagram plugin for WordPress. The others fail to live up to this free plugin, the only downside is the developers haven‚Äôt updated it in a while.
For such a fantastic plugin with lots of potential, it‚Äôs a shame that it doesn‚Äôt get a little Update Love from the developers.

This used to be a really useful plugin that was fairly easy to set up and gave you just the right amount of options for the display of either your own Instagram pictures or a feed based on an universal tag.
Unfortunately it is no longer maintained. This spring it has slowely stopped working. First the tag-stopped. Not everywhere, just in a couple of places but now it is more broken than working.
I have tried other options (I will not mention which because then one of the moderators will turn up and deleate this) but haven‚Äôt found anything as useful.
