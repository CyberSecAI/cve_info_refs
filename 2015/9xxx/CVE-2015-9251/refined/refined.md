      ],
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from how jQuery handles cross-domain Ajax requests when the `dataType` option is not specified. Specifically, it's triggered when a server returns a `text/javascript` response.  jQuery attempts to process the response and unintentionally executes the JavaScript code contained within it. This happens because jQuery, upon receiving such response from a cross-origin request without explicit dataType, bypasses the XSS prevention mechanisms which would otherwise prevent code execution.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	"Inadequate input validation"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can perform a cross-site scripting attack, which can allow them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing, and defacement of websites.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Performing a cross-domain Ajax request without the dataType option"
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the response of the cross-domain AJAX request."

    "Detection": {
      "detection_methods": [
        "Verify the jQuery version in use.",
		"Check if the application is making cross-domain AJAX requests without the dataType option"
      ],
      "Detection_logic": "Verify if the target system uses a version of jQuery prior to 3.0.0, and if the system performs cross-domain AJAX requests without specifying the `dataType` option. A vulnerable system is one that meets the specified conditions with the vulnerable version of jQuery.",
