Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in GoCodes plugin 1.3.5:

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization of the `deletegc` parameter in the `tools.php` page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected XSS vulnerability due to the direct output of the unsanitized user-supplied `deletegc` parameter.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This could allow them to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attack is carried out via a crafted URL, specifically targeting the `deletegc` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in user (like an editor) to click on it. The user must have sufficient permissions to access the vulnerable page. There is no CSRF protection, making it easier to trigger the vulnerability.

**2. Blind SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of input sanitization of the `gcid` parameter in the `tools.php` page when resetting the count.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Blind SQL injection due to the injection of arbitrary SQL commands in the `gcid` parameter within database queries.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service. By using time-based techniques like `SLEEP()`, the attacker can infer information about the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted URL, specifically targeting the `gcid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in user (like an editor) to click on it, and that user must have sufficient permissions to access the vulnerable page. There is no CSRF protection, making it easier to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified SQL injection vulnerability exists at multiple locations: `menus.php:79`, `menus.php:63`, and `menus.php:158`.
*   Both vulnerabilities require an authenticated user (like an editor) to be logged in.
*  The plugin has been closed due to an unknown reason as of November 28, 2017.
