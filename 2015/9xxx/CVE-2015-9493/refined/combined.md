### [Great plugin, just missing one function](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-just-missing-one-function/)

Does what it says it will be doing. Very easy to manage. Haven’t done much styling yet, but can’t see any problems with this.
Just one thing I am missing is an email to the person that has selected a gift and put their name and email down.
Instead the list owner gets a notification.
Thanks
