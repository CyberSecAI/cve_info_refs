Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the usage of `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin where the third parameter, which should be a properly escaped URL, is instead an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core issue is the failure to properly sanitize URLs passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin did not use `esc_url()` or a similar escaping function on the URL parameter before using it in the query string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Redirect Vulnerability:** By injecting a malicious URL, an attacker could redirect users to a harmful site. This can be used for phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious URL Injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL and injects it as the third parameter of vulnerable `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` function calls.
-   **User Interaction:** The attack typically requires some form of user interaction, such as clicking a link containing the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** An attacker needs to identify instances where the plugin uses `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` with an unescaped URL parameter.
-   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs that redirect users to a site under their control.
