Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9451 (though not explicitly mentioned, this vulnerability is the reason for the plugin closure, and the report aligns with the vulnerability description)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input (specifically, the `pmfb_tid` parameter) before using it in SQL queries. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection. This means the attacker cannot directly see the results of their SQL queries, but can infer results based on the time it takes the server to respond.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to:
    - Data Breach: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Data Modification: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Privilege Escalation: Potentially gaining higher access to the system.
    - Denial of Service: Disrupting the functionality of the application or the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, which is part of WordPress, using the vulnerable actions `pmfb_cc` and `pmfb_mailchimp`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `pmfb_tid`, which is sent as part of the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated or logged in to the WordPress system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site, thus being a remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the `admin-ajax.php` file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in version 2.0.13 of the "Plugmatter Optin Feature Box" plugin.
- The plugin was closed due to this security issue.
- The exploit was verified using SQLMap, which is a tool designed for SQL injection testing.
