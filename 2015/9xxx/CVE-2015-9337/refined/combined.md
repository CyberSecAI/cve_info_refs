## FAQ

### How do I display the user registration and user profile forms in the front-end?

You simply need to add the available plugin blocks or the following shorcodes: **[wppb-register]** & **[wppb-edit-profile]** to a page and publish it. You can also use the plugin setup wizard to create the pages for you.

### Is Profile Builder user registration plugin compatible with page builders like Elementor, Divi, etc.?

Yes, Profile Builder is fully compatible with [Elementor](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/304814-elementor-register-form-free/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=pb-description-page&utm_campaign=PBFree), Divi, WordPress Block Editor, Brizy, Visual Composer and more.

### I navigated away from Profile Builder and now I cannot find it anymore; where is it?

User Profile Builder can be found in the default menu of your WordPress installation below the Users menu item.

### Why do the default WordPress user fields still show up in the back-end?

Profile Builder can only remove the default user fields in the front-end of your site/blog, it doesn’t remove them from the back-end.

### I can’t find a question similar to my issue; Where can I find support?

For more information please check out the [documentation section](https://www.cozmoslabs.com/docs/profile-builder/) from Profile Builder – front-end user registration plugin.

Great plugin (in fair price if you decide to get the pro version). I’m using it together with the Membership plugin and I’m pretty satisfied with the solution. Excellent documentation, very helpful and explaining support. Keep up the good work !

This plugin is a great start when you use the free version. It helps immensely with the initial form setup and the shortcode customization. The registration, login logout and the forgot password pages. Then when I got the paid version. WOW!! It added a ton of plugins addons that are included with the paid version. I have added 8 addons so far to enhance my membership login area. This has been one of the easiest installations I have ever been through. The only down sides are –
so many addons (Like that is a problem) it takes quite a bit to understand which addons get installed how and then to configure them.
There is no where on the page listing to show what pages are locked down and to what user groups. You have to go into each page to look to see if you have the page locked down or not. It would be easier to see that information on the page listing page.
I whole heartly recommend this plugin. I have not had an issue yet that I have not been able to figure out with the documentation that comes with the plugin.
Try it out, you won’t regret your decision!
