Plugin developers are an odd lot. They think it’s ok to sell a plugin and then not provide access to terms and condtions or a way to contact them about billing issues.
I bought this plugin and ended up deleting it and now I get a fucking NO REPLY email about auto renewal, telling me to go to my paypal account, which does not exist.
This plugin creates a huge load and really slows a websites load speeds down big time. And the conflicts!!! OYVEY!!!
Signed,
Hell in a Handbasket
