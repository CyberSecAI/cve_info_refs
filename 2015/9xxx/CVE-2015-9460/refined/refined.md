Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9460

**Vulnerability Description:** The provided content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the "Booking System" WordPress plugin version 2.0. This vulnerability is present in the `DOPBSPBackEndTranslation::display()` function.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `language` parameter within the `DOPBSPBackEndTranslation::display()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability in the `language` parameter.
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability is further compounded by the absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, allowing an attacker to potentially execute the attack through a crafted web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to various impacts:
    - **Data theft:** Sensitive data can be extracted from the database.
    - **Data modification:** Data can be altered or deleted, potentially disrupting the website functionality.
    - **Privilege escalation:** An attacker could potentially gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`language` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `language` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. This includes roles like subscriber, editor, etc.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint and the `dopbsp_translation_display` action, as well as the vulnerable parameter, `language`.

**Technical Details:**
The provided example uses a `sleep(10)` statement in the SQL injection to confirm the vulnerability. This will cause the server to pause for 10 seconds if the injection is successful, confirming that the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
```
curl --cookie "..." --request POST --data "action=dopbsp_translation_display&language=en t1 where id=(select sleep(10))-- -&text_group=all" <http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php>
```

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 2.0 of the "Booking System" plugin.
- The `DOPBSPBackEndTranslation::display` function is located in `/booking-system/includes/translation/class-backend-translation.php`.
- The SQL query is executed via the `wpdb::get_results` function.

This information aligns with the typical characteristics of a SQL injection vulnerability.
