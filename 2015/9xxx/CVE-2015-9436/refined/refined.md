Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Dynamic Widgets plugin, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to both reflected and potentially stored XSS attacks.

    *   **Reflected XSS via POST:** Authenticated users can inject HTML/JavaScript code through the `prefix` and `widget_id` parameters in a POST request to `admin-ajax.php?action=term_tree`.
    *   **Reflected XSS via GET:** Authenticated administrators can inject HTML/JavaScript code through the `page_limit` parameter in a GET request to `themes.php?page=dynwid-config`.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability affecting administrators lacks CSRF protection, making it easier to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim (e.g., change settings, modify content, add malicious code).
    *   Redirect the victim to a malicious website.
    *   Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Request Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code using a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **GET Request Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code through a crafted URL when accessing the plugin's admin configuration page (`themes.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For the POST-based XSS, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user, even a low-privileged subscriber can exploit this.
*   For the GET-based XSS, the attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with the malicious parameters or convince a victim to click on a crafted URL.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The `dynamic-widgets.php` file at line 831, and `custompost_module.php` at line 278 are involved in the POST based XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability using the `page_limit` parameter is located in `dynwid_admin_overview.php` file on line 146.
*   The provided verification examples clearly demonstrate how to inject the malicious javascript payloads.
