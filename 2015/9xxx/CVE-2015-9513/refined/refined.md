Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security fix:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises when the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions are used with an unescaped or untrusted URL as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unescaped URL parameter: The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of the URL passed as a parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`. These functions are used to modify URLs by adding or removing query parameters. If the URL is not properly escaped, it can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content doesn't specify the exact impact, but using an unescaped URL could lead to various issues, including:
   - Redirection to malicious sites (phishing)
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the URL is reflected in the page.
   - Other potential vulnerabilities depending on how the URL is used further in the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that is then used in conjunction with the vulnerable functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL that is being passed as the third parameter to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions. This could involve manipulating user-controlled input or exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow URL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The blog post indicates that the security fix was automatically deployed, suggesting the vulnerability was considered critical.
- The comment by "Philip" and the response by "Pippin Williamson" give more technical insight into the nature of the vulnerability.
- The fix likely involves wrapping the URL parameter with `esc_url()` to ensure it's properly sanitized before being used.
