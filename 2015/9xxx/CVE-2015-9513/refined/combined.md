 [About this capture](#expand)

COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/NO404)

These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.

Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.

The goal is to [fix all broken links on the web](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/).
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.

Collection: [Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)](https://archive.org/details/NO404-WKP)

This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.

This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to [rid the web of broken links](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/).

Hey Pippin, thanks for this, I am waiting to hear back from my developer about this update now. Would not doing the update cause functionality problems with the site? Eg in the last day or so my landing pages post payment are no longer working (I was not aware until a few moments ago that you had released a security fix).

Thanks.

Unless you have opted out of automatic updates, your site probably already has the update installed since this was an automatically deployed update.

We’d be happy to help track down the payment issue for you if you’d like to open a support ticket.

I’m not sure I understand. Does the vulnerability lie in the mere presence of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` without those being wrapped in `esc_url()` ? I must be wrong because I see unescaped `add_query_arg` in EDD 2.3.8 ..

No, not all cases of add/remove\_query\_arg() are vulnerable. They are only vulnerable if the 3rd parameter passed to the function is an unescaped / trusted URL.
