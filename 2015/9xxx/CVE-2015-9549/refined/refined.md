Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9549:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `field_name` parameter within the `OCF_EMOTICON_CELL.tpl` template file. Specifically, the `field_name` variable wasn't marked with an asterisk (`*`), which would have triggered the XSS filter. This oversight allows unsanitized user input to be directly included into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. User-supplied input is reflected back in the response without proper sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `field_name` parameter before including it in the HTML output.
*   **Template Handling Error:** The templating system, designed to escape potentially harmful HTML, failed to do so for this specific variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application via the `field_name` parameter.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks against users who view the malicious link.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is via a crafted URL containing a malicious script in the `field_name` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to click on the malicious link, which results in the malicious script being executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application.
* Example GET request: `http://localhost/ocportal/data/emoticons.php?field_name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>&keep_session=1840048647&utheme=default&overlay=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct and distribute a URL containing a malicious script in the `field_name` parameter
*   The attacker needs to rely on social engineering to lure a victim to click on the malicious link.
*   No special privileges are required on the target server for this reflected XSS attack.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in OcPortal CMS version 9.0.20.
* The vulnerable file is `/ocportal/themes/default/templates/OCF_EMOTICON_CELL.tpl`.
* The `emoticons.php` file uses `field_name` parameter from a GET request, and renders it using the template file without proper sanitization.
* The issue was reported by Arjun Basnet of Cyber Security Works Pvt. Ltd.
