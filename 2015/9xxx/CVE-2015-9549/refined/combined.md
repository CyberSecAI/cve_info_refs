## Description

[![@cybersecurityworks](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13975575?u=82c9d5126699baf529f74090bfd755fcbf93025c&v=4&size=48)](/cybersecurityworks)[cybersecurityworks](https://github.com/cybersecurityworks)opened [on Nov 13, 2015](https://github.com/cybersecurityworks/Disclosed/issues/11#issue-116713139)

As per the documentation of the Ocportal, a value in a template that is not meant to contain HTML is marked as an escaped value ({VALUE\*}). This meant that ‘html entities’ are put in replacement of HTML control characters.

[![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140283/d4bd5918-89fe-11e5-8f92-4feb42ae381e.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140283/d4bd5918-89fe-11e5-8f92-4feb42ae381e.png)

[![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140291/f254b62e-89fe-11e5-9e8f-7de91572aaf0.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140291/f254b62e-89fe-11e5-9e8f-7de91572aaf0.png)

Here the VALUE that is marked with \* symbol will be filtered with the XSS filter and it will be sanitized before displaying it to the user. But they forgot to mark FIELD\_NAME in OCF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tpl file.

\ocportal\themes\default\templates\OCF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tpl

[![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140294/fe5be8fc-89fe-11e5-8700-2ec4cc4a4b15.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140294/fe5be8fc-89fe-11e5-8700-2ec4cc4a4b15.png)

The View\_all link besides the emoticons in the following screen is having this FIELD\_NAME variable

[![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140319/36368cf0-89ff-11e5-870a-5723e26c7f07.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140319/36368cf0-89ff-11e5-870a-5723e26c7f07.png)

The View\_all link is sending the following GET request to the server

[![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140324/48c6c268-89ff-11e5-80c0-059120f7d1b2.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140324/48c6c268-89ff-11e5-80c0-059120f7d1b2.png)

The following is the source code of emoticons.php file

\ocportal\data\emotions.php

[![6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140330/61fb48e4-89ff-11e5-8ebf-24b769dac0d4.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140330/61fb48e4-89ff-11e5-8ebf-24b769dac0d4.png)

The following is the code related to emoticons\_script function in misc\_scritps.php file

\ocportal\sources\misc\_scripts.php

[![7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140346/77638fd4-89ff-11e5-9648-e2592f5167d7.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140346/77638fd4-89ff-11e5-9648-e2592f5167d7.png)

Code that is loading the template file with the user entered input

\ocportal\sources\misc\_scripts.php

[![8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140377/a3e706bc-89ff-11e5-83d4-1fe70e0d1f39.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140377/a3e706bc-89ff-11e5-83d4-1fe70e0d1f39.png)

This code is reading the GET request parameter field\_name and displaying it back to the user without filtering because of the variable is not marked with \* symbol. Obviously it won’t go for any filtration.

[![9](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140391/da542fd6-89ff-11e5-8ef7-49a0106eb4df.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13975575/11140391/da542fd6-89ff-11e5-8ef7-49a0106eb4df.png)

And the inserted payload is reflecting back to the user as shown in the following screen.

## CVE-2015-9549 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in OcPortal CMS

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### OcPortal

#### Affected Product

##### OcPortal

#### CVE

##### CVE-2015-9549

#### Securin ID

##### 2015-CSW-10-1013

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### November 6, 2015

### Description

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability identified on OcPortal CMS 9.0.20. An input variable vulnerable to XSS is âfield\_nameâ in the CF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tplfile.\ocportal\themes\default\templates\OCF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tpl.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

As per the documentation of the Ocportal, a value in a template that is not meant to contain HTML is marked as an escaped value ({VALUE\*}). This means that âHTML entitiesâ are put in replacement of HTML control characters.

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(6).png)

Here the VALUE that is marked with \* symbol will be filtered with the XSS filter, and it will be sanitized before displaying it to the user, but they forgot to mark FIELD\_NAME in OCF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tplfile.\ocportal\themes\default\templates\OCF\_EMOTICON\_CELL.tpl

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(5).png)

The View\_all link beside the emoticons in the following screen is having this FIELD\_NAME variable.

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-3(3).png)

The View\_all link is sending the following GET request to the server

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-4(2).png)

The following is the source code of emoticons.php file\ocportal\data\emotions.php

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-5(1).png)

The following is the code related to emoticons\_script function in misc\_scritps.php file\ocportal\sources\misc\_scripts.php

\ocportal\sources\misc\_scripts.php

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-6.png)

Code that is loading the template file with the user-entered input \ocportal\sources\misc\_scripts.php

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-7.png)

This code is reading the GET request parameter field\_name and displaying it back to the user without filtering because of the variable is not marked with \* symbol. Obviously, it will not go for any filtration.

GET request to emoticons.php with script vector as the value of field\_name

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-8.png)

And the inserted payload is reflecting back to the user, as shown in the following screen.

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-9.png)

### Impact

A reflected cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the emotions.php by providing XSS payload as a value for field\_name.

### Remediations

Download the latest version and update it as per the vendor advisory.
