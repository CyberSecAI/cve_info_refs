The provided content is related to the NewStatPress WordPress plugin, and it mentions several security vulnerabilities that were fixed in different versions, including XSS and SQL injection issues. However, it does not specifically mention CVE-2015-9313.

Specifically, the changelog mentions:

*   **Version 1.0.6 (2015-07-01):** "Close a possible Reflected XSS attack" and "Avoid MySQL error if erroneous input is given"
*   **Version 1.0.5 (2015-06-30):** "Close a XSS and a SQLI Injection involved IMG tag"
*  **Version 1.0.4 (2015-06-30):** "Close a persistent XSS via HTTP-Header (Referer) (no authentication required)"
*   **Version 1.0.1 (2015-06-08):** "Close a SQL injection"
*   **Version 0.9.9 (2015-05-20):** "Close a XSS and a SQL injection and possible other more complex to achieve"

It also states:

*   "IMPORTANT: all previous versions from 1.0.4 are subject to XSS and SQL injection from an old Statpress routine. You have to use at least version 1.0.6 to avoid security issue."

Based on the information provided, we can extract the following vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerabilities stem from an old StatPress routine that was not properly sanitized, leading to XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   SQL Injection (SQLI)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   XSS can lead to arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   SQL Injection can allow attackers to read or modify the database, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Reflected XSS via user input.
*   Persistent XSS via HTTP Referer header.
*   SQL injection via unsanitized database queries using user-controlled parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to induce a user to click on a malicious link or visit a crafted page.
*  For persistent XSS, no user interaction is needed, the attacker just needs a malicious referer header to be processed by the plugin.
*   For SQL injection, an attacker would need to craft malicious input to be processed by the vulnerable SQL queries.
    
**Additional Notes**
*   The content states that versions prior to 1.0.6 are vulnerable to XSS and SQL injection.
*   The plugin's changelog highlights a series of patches aimed at improving sanitization and fixing various XSS and SQL injection issues over multiple releases.
* The external API was also subject to multiple fixes in regards to XSS and SQL injection.

Since the provided document doesn't mention `CVE-2015-9313`, but provides significant information about XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities within the specified timeframe, it is considered **RELEVANT**
