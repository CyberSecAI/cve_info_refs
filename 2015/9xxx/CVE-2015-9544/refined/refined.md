Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-9544:

**CVE-2015-9544** (and related issues)

*   **Root Cause:** The `xdLocalStorage` library, designed for cross-domain local storage, lacks proper origin validation when handling `postMessage` events. This means that messages from any origin can interact with the library, leading to security vulnerabilities.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Origin Validation (CVE-2015-9544, CVE-2015-9545):** The `receiveMessage` functions in both `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` (in the "magical iframe") and `xdLocalStorage.js` (in the client) do not validate the origin of incoming messages. This allows any website to send a crafted message and potentially interact with the local storage of the target domain or execute code via callback functions.
    *   **Wildcard `targetOrigin` (CVE-2020-11610, CVE-2020-11611):** The `postMessage` calls in `xdLocalStoragePostMessageApi.js` and `xdLocalStorage.js` use a wildcard (`*`) for `targetOrigin`. This means that any website can receive the messages sent from the "magical iframe" or the client, potentially leaking sensitive information.
    *  **Lack of input validation:** Even with origin validation, there is no input validation of the data received, and the message is parsed as JSON. This leaves potential for DOM based XSS or other injection issues.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary local storage manipulation:** An attacker can set, modify, or delete local storage data of the target domain. This can compromise the integrity of the application.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract all data from the local storage by combining the lack of origin validation with the wildcard `targetOrigin`.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the lack of origin validation in the client, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the client's context using crafted messages and callback functions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker entices a user to visit a malicious website.
    *   The malicious website embeds the legitimate site with the vulnerable `xdLocalStorage` library in an `iframe` or interacts with the legitimate site which is already loaded.
    *   The malicious website sends crafted `postMessage` events to the embedded iframe with a `namespace` that matches the configured `MESSAGE_NAMESPACE`, or to the vulnerable client.
    *   Due to the missing origin validation, these messages are processed by the legitimate application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to host a malicious website.
    *   Ability to send messages to the target's origin using `postMessage`.
    *   Knowledge of the `xdLocalStorage` library's message structure.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided content includes a blog post from grimhacker.com that discusses these vulnerabilities in detail with proof of concept code. It also highlights the issue being raised in the project's GitHub issues but without resolution, emphasizing that the vulnerabilities are known but not patched.
*   The content from GitHub includes issue #17, which discusses the need for restricting access by origins. The pull request #19 was created to address this, but it was never merged.
*   The grimhacker.com blog post also provides mitigation strategies:
    *   Implement proper origin validation in the `receiveMessage` handlers.
    *   Specify the `targetOrigin` instead of using wildcard (`*`) in the `postMessage` calls.
    *   Consider replacing `xdLocalStorage` with a maintained alternative.
    *   Validate the data received from `postMessage` events.
* The article highlights that all versions of the `xdLocalStorage` library are vulnerable (1.0.1 to 2.0.5).

This detailed analysis provides a more thorough understanding of the security implications of using the `xdLocalStorage` library.
