I chose (and sadly paid for) this program from reading what was offered. I needed something to sell downloads but that had the feature to give them at no charge to people who qualify for a free gift. A coupon code is what you need, right? Offer it with a “code’ that they apply at checkout and make the discount 100%. Unfortunately the code offered by this program lets just ONE person redeem it, then it goes inactive. It also is not per product, but for the entire catalog of products. I don’t wish to give everything on my site free, just the one that was qualified for. Still trying to figure out a way to make this work since the cost is so high.
