Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2015-9253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) handles the `STDIN` stream of child processes when it's set to non-blocking mode.
- When a PHP script uses `stream_set_blocking(STDIN, false);`, it makes the `STDIN` file descriptor non-blocking.
- PHP-FPM, in its initialization process, duplicates the listening socket to the child process's `STDIN`.  When `STDIN` is non-blocking, the child process gets stuck in a loop of attempting to read from the socket without actually blocking, causing a rapid restart of the child processes and high CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect STDIN Handling:**  PHP-FPM incorrectly uses the `STDIN` file descriptor after it has been set to non-blocking, causing the child processes to continuously attempt non-blocking read operations, leading to a crash loop.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The rapid restart of child processes leads to excessive CPU consumption and log file growth, causing a denial of service.
- **Bypassing process limits:** When this happens, the process limits for fpm are not being honored, leading to system overload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by exploiting this vulnerability, making the server unresponsive.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** 100% CPU usage and rapid disk space consumption due to excessive log file growth.
- **Service Instability:** PHP-FPM child processes enter a continuous restart loop, disrupting the execution of PHP scripts.
- **System crash:** In extreme cases the system runs out of diskspace and crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a web request that executes a PHP script containing the vulnerable code (i.e. setting STDIN to non-blocking and using program execution functions).
- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP code on the server.
- **Shared Hosting:** Shared hosting environments are particularly vulnerable, where one user can potentially cause a DoS affecting other users on the same server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP code on the server.  This could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities or through legitimate access to a shared hosting environment.
- **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with the ability to execute PHP code, without needing special system privileges (i.e. root).
- **Low Access Complexity:** Exploitation is simple and requires minimal configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of PHP, ranging from 5.4 to 7.2, and likely earlier versions as well, until the fix has been applied.
- The fix involves changing PHP-FPM to directly listen on the socket instead of redirecting it to `STDIN`.
