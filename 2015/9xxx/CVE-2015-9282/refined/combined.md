#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

Sanitizes user-supplied data in the piechart.

Adds no new dependencies, just makes use of the already installed lodash.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Text panels can contain any html and therefore pose an XSS security problem.

Grafana should come with a backend option to disable and or sanitize html in text panels.

# Exploiting XSS in Grafana's piechart-panel

In late 2018, through a series of coincidences, I became aware of an XSS
vulnerability in the [pie chart](https://github.com/grafana/piechart-panel/)
plugin made by Grafana. For those who are unaware, Grafana is a relatively
popular data visualisation platform: you set up an instance, connect it to
your data, and the promise is that Grafana will help you map that data in
an easy way. I really like it - it forms the interface to a small weather
station in my flat. The pie chart plugin is written by Grafanaâs own devs,
and is reasonably popular; as of writing,
it sits near the top of Grafanaâs plugins [page](https://grafana.com/plugins).

The XSS vulnerability is not new, and there has been a
[Github issue](https://github.com/grafana/piechart-panel/issues/3)
regarding the vulnerability open for over three years now. After I was made
aware of this, I created a
[pull request](https://github.com/grafana/piechart-panel/pull/163) with a fix for the issue.
After some initial activity, nothing has happened on the ticket. As it has been
three years since initial disclosure and well over a month since I submitted my
pull request, I decided to publish this article to provide a deeper dive into how
this issue could be exploited to gain access to a Grafana cluster.

## How the vulnerability works

The vulnerability itself is trivial. The pie chart doesnât sanitise legend data
or tooltip data in any way, so virtually any basic XSS payload that is sent to
be displayed in the legend will execute in the browserâs context
(think `</a><script>alert(1)</script>`, for example).

## Exploiting the issue

Exploiting the issue remotely is much trickier. I am going to assume for this
exercise that you are conducting a red team exercise against an application that
you have already identified as Grafana (running on port 3000 can be one clue, as
that is the default port for a vanilla installation). In many scenarios, it is
probable that Grafana is being used as a visualisation and metrics engine for
web application traffic. I would recommend fuzzing web app endpoints heavily here, with payloads
that call back to a server under your control when they are loaded. If you get
a callback, you know that youâre in. It is probably wise to dump `document.cookie`
into the callback as well, to speed things up.

There are two cookie values that are most relevant for going further, `grafana_sess`
and `grafana_remember`. I havenât looked at the implementation of the cookie logic
closely, but `grafana_sess` appears to be the session cookie, while `grafana_remember`
appears to be some sort of refresh token. I was initially disappointed, as the
`grafana_sess` cookie is set to be `HttpOnly`, which means you canât extricate it
directly using your XSS.

As I soon discovered, however, you can use the `grafana_remember` value (not `HttpOnly`,
and therefore pilferable) and the username (also not `HttpOnly`) to get yourself
a valid `grafana_sess` value. A request like:

```

GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: $YOUR_HOST_HERE
Connection: close
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.98 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: grafana_remember=980132c3a59af478a353d3374ed9e3b9e87400d09c2e45e58a7ce613c22aef670f; grafana_user=$YOUR_USER_HERE

```

will get you a response like:

```

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 05 Feb 2019 19:28:48 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains;
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Location: /login
Content-Length: 29
Set-Cookie: grafana_sess=f6ae05d3f6ecdde7; Path=/; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: redirect_to=%252Fd%252Fnew-dashboard-copy%253ForgId%253D1; Path=/; HttpOnly
Connection: close

[Found](/login).

```

With your `grafana_sess` value from the response, you now have access
to all the application cookies you require to load the application as
an authenticated user.

## What do you get?

The value in Grafana lies in the fact that itâs directly connected to databases.
Browse to `/datasources` on an instance, and you should see DB configuration and
access details. At the very least this will be valuable information in planning
further attacks. A misconfigured Grafana instance could also give you the keys
to all of an appâs data.

Given its importance, I consider the XSS to be a fairly severe vulnerability. In
conjunction with the fact that you can bypass what little `HttpOnly` protection
there is, I have been surprised by how little attention has been given to fixing
the issue.

## How do you protect your Grafana instance?

1. Apply the fix from [my pull request](https://github.com/grafana/piechart-panel/pull/163).
   I am fairly sure it does what it says on the tin, although I havenât received
   any feedback on it so ymmv.
2. Stop using the pie chart plugin, although other XSS vulnerabilities probably
   exist in the platform.
3. Make all the cookies used by Grafana `HttpOnly` - although that might break
   other functionality on the platform, I havenât checked.

## Postscript

[Matt](https://hackerific.net/) suggested that I applied for a CVE, which was
[surprisingly easy](https://cveform.mitre.org/). Within a day,
[CVE-2015-9282](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9282) was granted, and
within two hours of me notifying the developers, my pull request was accepted.
Versions 1.3.6 of the plugin upwards are now fixed.
