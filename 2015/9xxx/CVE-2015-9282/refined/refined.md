Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9282

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data in the pie chart plugin's legend and tooltip data. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the pie chart plugin not sanitizing data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser context of users viewing the affected pie chart.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal `grafana_remember` and `grafana_user` cookies to obtain a valid `grafana_sess` cookie, effectively hijacking the user's session.
- **Data access:** With the hijacked session, the attacker gains access to Grafana's data sources, potentially exposing sensitive information such as database credentials.
- **Further attacks:** A compromised Grafana instance can provide valuable information for planning subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** The XSS vulnerability can be exploited remotely by injecting malicious payloads into data visualized by the pie chart plugin.
- **Web application fuzzing:** Attackers can fuzz web application endpoints with payloads designed to trigger the XSS when loaded by Grafana.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to inject data:** The attacker needs to be able to inject data that will be visualized by the pie chart plugin.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Grafana instance via the network.
- **Knowledge of Grafana:** The attacker needs to know the default port of Grafana (3000), or be able to identify it on a non-standard port.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the Grafana pie chart plugin.
- The vulnerability was reported through a GitHub issue and fixed by a pull request.
- The `grafana_sess` cookie is `HttpOnly`, but the `grafana_remember` and username are not, allowing for session hijacking.
- The article notes that after the CVE was assigned, the fix was accepted by the maintainers and the vulnerability was resolved. The fixed version of the plugin is 1.3.6 and later.

**More detail than the CVE description:** The provided content gives much more information than a typical CVE entry, such as the specific steps an attacker would take, the session hijacking methodology, and specific cookie details, as well as specific code changes to fix the issue.
