*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises when the third parameter passed to `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` is an unescaped or untrusted URL.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper sanitization of URLs passed to `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The content does not specify the impact of exploitation, but it suggests an ability to manipulate URLs, which could potentially lead to various issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or phishing.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would involve crafting a malicious URL and injecting it as the third parameter to vulnerable instances of `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence the URL being passed to the vulnerable functions.
