Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way `picocom` was handling external commands for file transfer operations.  Prior to the fix, it used `/bin/sh` to execute these commands. This allowed for command injection if filenames or extra arguments passed to `send-file` and `receive-file` contained shell metacharacters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By embedding malicious shell commands within filenames or arguments for file transfers, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the host system.
*   **Insecure use of `/bin/sh`:** The program's reliance on `/bin/sh` to execute commands without proper sanitization of user-supplied input created the injection point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running `picocom`. This could lead to data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Transfer Commands:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `send-file` and `receive-file` commands in `picocom`. An attacker could craft malicious filenames or arguments containing shell commands, which would be executed when these commands were used.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to initiate a file transfer with the attacker-controlled malicious filename or arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the filename or arguments passed to the `send-file` or `receive-file` commands when using `picocom`. This could occur through:
    *   Interception of the data transfer or via a compromised computer, where the attacker can modify file paths before picocom is called.
    *   Social Engineering, where the attacker can convince a user to supply the malicious path.

**Additional Information (from the GitHub Commit):**

*   The fix implemented in the commit involves parsing the command line and splitting it into arguments internally by `picocom` itself. This new implementation attempts to mimic shell quoting rules and avoid calling `/bin/sh`.
* The commit removes the reliance on `/bin/sh` and introduces a new `split.c` module to handle command argument parsing.
* The vulnerability was fixed in commit `1ebc60b20fbe9a02436d5cbbf8951714e749ddb1`.
