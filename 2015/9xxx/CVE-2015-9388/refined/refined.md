Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in the mTouch Quiz WordPress plugin:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflected XSS on Quiz Manage:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `quiz` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allows injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted URL with XSS payload in the `quiz` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin into clicking on a crafted URL or visiting a webpage containing the malicious URL.

2.  **CSRF on General Options:**
    *   **Root cause:** Missing security token (nonce) to protect against CSRF attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of CSRF protection.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can make unauthorized changes to the plugin's general settings on behalf of a logged-in admin user.
    *   **Attack vector:** A malicious HTML form submitted via the user's browser.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin into visiting a page with the malicious HTML form.

3.  **Add a question using CSRF and get a persistent XSS:**
    *   **Root cause:** Combination of CSRF vulnerability and lack of sanitization when adding quiz questions.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of CSRF protection when adding quiz questions, and unsanitized input for the question content.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can add a question containing a persistent XSS payload which will be executed when users view the question.
    *  **Attack vector:** A malicious HTML form that adds a new question to a quiz using the CSRF vulnerability.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin into visiting a page with the malicious HTML form.

4.  **Quiz Name XSS:**
     *   **Root cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of the quiz name input.
    *  **Weakness**: Unsanitized input allows XSS payloads.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a persistent XSS payload in the quiz name, which will be executed when other users view the quiz.
     *  **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted quiz name.
     *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the quiz name (likely admin or a privileged user).

**Summary of Impact**

The vulnerabilities found could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in administrator's session.
