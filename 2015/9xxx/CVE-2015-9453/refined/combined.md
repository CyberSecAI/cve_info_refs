As the plugin is listing all attemps to find an URL on your site, it logs bad bots attemps – like looking for a timthumb.php script in a theme you never installed or deleted a long time ago.
I have no time to filter myself relevant broken links and bad reports so, I’m not convinced by the plugin.

Subject: Persistent XSS in Broken Link manager Ver 0.5.5Date: Thu, 16 Jul 2015 10:13:59 +0200

Hello,
Plugin:Â Broken Link manager Ver 0.5.5Â <https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-manager/>

Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious html/javascript. Referer and user-agent headers are not sanitized when displayed in log (<http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wblm-log>) which leads to persistent XSS vulnerability.

1. XSS (\_custom\_redirect())
Url: Non-existent (that produces 404)Function: \_custom\_redirectVulnerable header parameters: Referer, User-Agent
Verification:
curl -A "<script>alert(1);</script>" -e "<script>alert(2);</script>" <http://localhost/index.php/some/url/that/does/not/exist>

And visit <http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wblm-log>

Regards
Marcin Probola,
