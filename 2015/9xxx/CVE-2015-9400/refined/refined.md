Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or validation within the `wp_meta_robots_plugin::meta_robots_insert_post` function. Specifically, the `ID` parameter received via a POST request is directly used in an SQL query without sufficient escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `ID` parameter, which is then executed against the database. The 'blind' aspect means that the attacker does not see the results of the query directly in the response, but can infer information by observing time delays (e.g., using `SLEEP()`) or other side effects.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability is compounded by the absence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection. This allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into submitting a crafted request, thereby enabling the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Data modification: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Privilege escalation: Possibly creating new administrator accounts or escalating privileges of existing accounts.
    *   Denial of Service: By using SQL queries that cause performance problems for the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/post-new.php`.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `ID` parameter is used as the injection point.
*   **User Authentication:** An attacker needs to target an authenticated user, such as an editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:**  The attacker must know about the existence of the `wordpress-meta-robots` plugin and its vulnerability.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious POST request with the injected SQL code.
*   **Targeting an authenticated user:** The attacker needs to either convince an authenticated user (editor) to perform the malicious request (CSRF) or have compromised user credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided email from Marcin Probola gives a detailed example of how the vulnerability could be exploited including vulnerable parameter and example SQL injection payload.
*   The plugin was closed on November 28, 2017 and is not available for download.
*   The "WordPress Meta Robots" plugin is closed and is not available for download. The last update was 7 years ago and tested up to WP 3.9.40.
