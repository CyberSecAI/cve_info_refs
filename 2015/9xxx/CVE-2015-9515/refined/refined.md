Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress without proper escaping of URLs passed as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unescaped URL Parameter:** The core issue is that if the 3rd parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL, it can lead to a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Redirection to Malicious Sites**:  A malicious actor could inject a malicious URL through the unescaped parameter. This would cause users to be redirected to an attacker-controlled site when the vulnerable code is executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  A malicious URL is injected as the 3rd parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- This is likely achieved by crafting a URL with a malicious payload that could be added to the query arguments by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the URL parameters or some data that is eventually passed as a parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- Knowledge of how these functions are used in the vulnerable application is required to craft a suitable malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The specific vulnerability was fixed in an automatic update, implying it affected live websites.
- The discussion in the comment section highlights that not all uses of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` are vulnerable, only those where the 3rd parameter is an untrusted URL.
- The fix was likely to escape the URL before passing it to the functions.
