  "cve": "CVE-2015-9004",
  "description": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability and its fix in the Linux kernel's perf subsystem. The vulnerability is related to the grouping of performance counters and can lead to issues where counters are programmed incorrectly, and semantically broken, if events for different CPUs are combined in the same group.",
  "affected_component": "Linux kernel perf subsystem",
  "root_cause": "The root cause is the incomplete fix from a previous patch that did not prevent grouping of performance counters for different CPUs. The code was confused when an event was migrated to form a group on another CPU and the programming of the counter would be incorrect.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper grouping of performance counters",
    "Incorrect programming of counters",
    "Potential for system instability or breakage"
  ],
  "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that the system would have performance counters that are programmed incorrectly, potentially leading to incorrect performance data and system instability or breakage.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Creating performance event groups with counters for different CPUs",
    "Migrating performance events between CPUs and grouping them"
  ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create and manage performance events, which requires specific permissions. The attacker also needs to be able to move events between CPUs to trigger the error condition"
