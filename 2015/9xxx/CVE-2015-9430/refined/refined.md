Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9430:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin "Crazy Bone" not properly sanitizing the User-Agent HTTP header. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to persistent XSS. The injected malicious code (in this case, a `<script>` tag) is stored and executed when a user visits a specific admin page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on the victim's behalf
    *   Potentially compromising the entire website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP User-Agent Header:** The attacker injects the malicious code into the User-Agent header of an HTTP request.
*   **Vulnerable Admin Page:** The injected payload is reflected and executed when a user visits the `wp-admin/users.php?page=crazy-bone/plugin.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious payload. They can inject the payload via an HTTP request including the user-agent header, even on the login page.
* The attacker does require knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and the specific admin page where the XSS is triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a curl example which demonstrates the attack.
*   The WordPress plugin page indicates that the plugin was closed due to a "Security Issue" and is no longer available for download. This confirms the severity of the vulnerability.
* The plugin version vulnerable is identified as 0.5.5.
