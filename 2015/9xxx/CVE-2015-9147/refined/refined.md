    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability is present in a closed-source component, which makes it difficult to analyze the exact weakness without access to the source code."

    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to cause a high impact, although the specific details are not provided. Given the severity rating is 'High', it implies a significant impact such as arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting a flaw in a Qualcomm closed-source component. The provided details do not specify if this is a local or remote attack, or if user interaction is required. Given that the severity is high, it is likely a versatile vector that can be achieved in different contexts"
