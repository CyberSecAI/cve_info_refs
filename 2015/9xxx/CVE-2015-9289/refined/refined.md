  "CVE-2015-9289": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was not properly validating the size of DiSEqC commands received from userspace, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A buffer overflow can be triggered, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability.",
       "Attack vectors": "A malicious userspace application could send an oversized DiSEqC command.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send ioctl calls to the driver from userspace. "
