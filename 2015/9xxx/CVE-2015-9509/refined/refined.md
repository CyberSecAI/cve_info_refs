Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin where the third parameter, intended for a URL, is an untrusted or unescaped URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core issue is that if a malicious URL is passed as a parameter to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` without proper escaping, it could lead to manipulation of the URL generated by the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potential for Malicious Redirects:** An attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL that redirects users to a phishing site or another malicious domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector would involve an attacker finding a place within the application where the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` function is called with a URL controlled by the attacker or an untrusted input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to identify a vulnerable part of the code where these functions are used with user-supplied data or unescaped URLs.
- The attacker would need the ability to control or manipulate the URL parameters passed to the vulnerable functions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The blog post mentions that not all cases of `add/remove_query_arg()` are vulnerable, only those where the 3rd parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL.
- The issue was addressed with an automatic update, indicating that the developers quickly responded to the vulnerability.
- The comments provide more technical detail than a standard CVE description.
