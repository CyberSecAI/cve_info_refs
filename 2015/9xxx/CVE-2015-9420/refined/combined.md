For a plugin that will obviously have its content seen in crucial pages of a website, it is very unprofessional to allow it to catastrophically break. I have wasted time setting up multiple pages using this plugin only to have them all simultaneously break. Other users have reported the same exact issue on the support forum but the plugin creator has not replied or even acknowledged the issue.
It was a good idea but executed poorly

I’ve been using SoundCloud is Gold for a number of years with great success. It’s always worked extremely well … easy to use … and very effective in delivering my audio files to my website. I give it my highest rating.

Easy to install and to set up, good looking in both widget- and full-width style. Selection of tracks, playlists and favorites makes it easy to have certain songs playing on specific sites. If problems arise then it’s handled very quickly. Thank you for this Plugin!

I had a client who wanted a SoundCloud player added to his site–this plugin made adding it a trivial effort. Does just what it’s supposed to. I ran into one problem after an update–it was immediately addressed by the author.

This is a great and useful plugin for anyone who wants to integrate Soundcloud to his website.
Also, the plugin author really helped out with an issue that had recently occurred.
Thanks!!!
