  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure application-coupling in Good Authentication Delegation. A third-party application can spoof its identity and request access to company servers and data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing authentication",
      "Insufficient protection of authentication delegation API",
       "Android IPC mechanism vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick a user into allowing access to company intranet servers via a faked Good Access app. The server administrator is unable to prevent or detect the unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted third-party Android app",
       "Android package name spoofing"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a third-party Android app that has a package name that starts with 'com.good.gdgma' and convince a user to install this app and grant it permissions."
  },
   "affected_products": [
    "Android Good Dynamics SDK version 1.11.1206",
    "Android Good Access app version 2.3.1.626",
    "Android Good for Enterprise app version 3.0.0.415",
    "Good Control server version 1.10.47.31",
    "Good Proxy server version 1.10.47.2",
    "Good for Enterprise server version 7.2.2.5c",
    "Other products, versions and apps using authentication-delegation may be affected as well."
  ],
  "additional_details": "The Good for Enterprise app could protect its authentication-delegation-API intent (Android IPC mechanism) with the signature level protection provided by the Android operating system (android:protectionLevel=\"signature\"). Only apps signed with the same private key can use such permissions. The Good Dynamics server administrator cannot distinguish between a malicious third-party app and the legitimate app accessing company data."
