**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**

*   **1.9.16.4:** Fix for a vulnerability related to discovering wp-admin URLs in WordPress with Gravity Forms.
    *   **Root cause:** The plugin was not properly handling requests that could reveal the custom login URL, especially when combined with Gravity Forms.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper access control, potentially leaking the custom login URL.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could discover the custom login URL, bypassing the intended security measure of the plugin.
    *   **Attack vector:** Specific request patterns, potentially using Gravity Forms as a part of the attack.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Basic ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site and some understanding of how Gravity Forms might interact with the login process.
*   **1.9.16:** Fix for a "Login Page Disclosure" vulnerability.
    *   **Root cause:**  The changelog entry is vague and does not describe the details of the vulnerability.
    *    **Weakness:** Information disclosure leading to revealing the login page.
    *    **Impact:** Attackers could discover the custom login URL, bypassing the intended security measure of the plugin.
*    **1.9.15:** Fix for a "Login Page Disclosure" vulnerability.
    *   **Root cause:**  The changelog entry is vague and does not describe the details of the vulnerability.
    *    **Weakness:** Information disclosure leading to revealing the login page.
    *    **Impact:** Attackers could discover the custom login URL, bypassing the intended security measure of the plugin.
*   **1.9.12:** Fix for a "Bypass Vulnerability" with multisite WordPress `/wp-admin/install.php`.
    *   **Root cause:**  The plugin did not correctly prevent access to the `/wp-admin/install.php` file on multisite installations, allowing a bypass of the custom login URL.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate access control on multisite installations.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could bypass the custom login URL by directly accessing the `/wp-admin/install.php` file.
    *   **Attack vector:** Direct request to the `/wp-admin/install.php` endpoint on a multisite WordPress setup.
    *  **Attacker capabilities:** Basic ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **1.9.1:** Fix for a security issue that allowed unauthenticated users to get the login page by setting a random referrer string via curl request.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `Referer` header.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the HTTP Referer header, bypassing the custom login.
    *   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker could potentially get access to the login page by crafting a specific request.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a specific HTTP request with a crafted Referer header using curl.
     *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send custom requests to the WordPress site, specifically by using curl.
*  **1.7:** Fix for a vulnerability related to posting "post_password" with arbitrary content to `/wp-login.php` which reveals the normal wordpress login page.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of the `post_password` parameter on the `/wp-login.php` endpoint.
    *    **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the `post_password` parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could bypass the custom login URL by directly accessing the `/wp-login.php` with a crafted request.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/wp-login.php` with a crafted `post_password` parameter.
     *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send custom POST requests to the WordPress site.
*  **1.5.3:** Fix for unspecified "Security vulnerabilities".
    *   **Root cause:** Not specified in the changelog.
    *   **Weakness:** Not specified in the changelog.
    *   **Impact:** Not specified in the changelog.
    *   **Attack vector:** Not specified in the changelog.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Not specified in the changelog.
*  **1.1:** Fix a CSRF security issue when saving option value.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of Cross-Site Request Forgery token.
    *   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection, enabling an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an admin.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially force an administrator to modify the plugin configuration.
    *   **Attack vector:** Social engineering or embedding malicious request within a malicious website or email.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to convince an admin to click on a link or visit a website under the attacker's control.

**Note:**
The plugin is designed to hide the default login URL (`wp-login.php` and `wp-admin`), however, the described vulnerabilities reveal cases where the custom login URL could be disclosed or bypassed. Some vulnerabilities provide more detail than others, indicating that some were more critical or easier to understand than others.
The identified vulnerabilities could potentially allow attackers to bypass the security mechanisms put in place by this plugin, and in cases that they also know the admin's username, it could lead to brute-force attacks.
