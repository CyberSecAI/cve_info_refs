Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions with an unescaped or untrusted URL as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The core issue is that the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions were used without proper sanitization of user-provided or untrusted URLs.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** When these functions are used to modify a URL and subsequently output it in the HTML, the lack of escaping can introduce vulnerabilities. Specifically, the blog post mentions the need to wrap the URL with `esc_url()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly stated in this article, but the comments in this thread suggest that this is a security issue which could lead to:
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the unescaped URL is manipulated by a malicious user and included in the output of the page, it could be used to inject malicious JavaScript into the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL, embedding malicious code or redirect targets, and pass it as an argument where the vulnerable code is called.
- **Phishing attacks:** By manipulating the URLs, attackers could redirect users to malicious websites disguised as the original site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to influence URL parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious URL into an area where it would be used by the vulnerable `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` calls.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints/parameters:** The attacker would need to be aware of the vulnerable parts of the code where these functions are being used without proper escaping and sanitation of URLs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was automatically deployed for most users, implying the severity of the issue.
- The comments confirm the issue was indeed related to the improper use of `add_query_arg`/`remove_query_arg`, particularly when combined with unescaped/untrusted URLs as the third parameter.
