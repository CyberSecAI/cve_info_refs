# CVE-2015-9019

| **Name** | CVE-2015-9019 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier, the EXSLT math.random function was not initialized with a random seed during startup, which could cause usage of this function to produce predictable outputs. |

<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=934119>
There's no indication that math.random() in intended to ensure cryptographic
randomness requirements. Proper seeding needs to happen in the application
using libxslt.

Random values are a set of values whose elements that have equal probability of occurrence. In this context, this set of elements is numbers between 0 and 1.  The problem lies in that the library returns always the same value since it is not using a random initialization vector. Therefore, without distinction on where is executed (python, php, or with xsltproc), the pattern of values will be always the same.   I found the following patch (<https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2013-February/msg06493.html>) related to the random functionality of xsltproc. However, I the random function in libxslt should be the one providing by default a random number. Furthermore, it should use by default an initialization vector and not the other way around. Developers may be using a fixed numbers instead of a "random number from 0 to 1” as the documentation states (<http://exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html>). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=934119#c6)  Petr Gajdos   2017-04-04 09:11:41 UTC  ``` $ cat random.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="random.xsl"?> <root/> $ cat random.xsl <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="<http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform>" xmlns:math="<http://exslt.org/math>" extension-element-prefixes="math"> <xsl:output omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>  <xsl:template match="/"> <xsl:value-of select="math:random()" /><xsl:text>&#xa;</xsl:text>  </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> $  BEFORE (1.2.28)  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.84018771715471  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.84018771715471  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.84018771715471  AFTER (1.2.29)  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.776777266886447  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.134103803026538  $ xsltproc random.xml random.xsl 0.494833716887438 $ ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=934119#c7)  Petr Gajdos   2017-04-04 09:15:53 UTC  ``` Commit from [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=934119#c1) fixes just xsltproc.

My searches didn't return anything for other major distributions. Apparently only openSUSE and Mageia are addressing this CVE with patches.  So should we still carry around our patch, really, even though other downstream distributions dismissed a fix in libxslt, and rather pointed that projects using it should be the ones taking care of the proper seeding?  If so I'd like to, at least, add the "PATCH-FIX-OPENSUSE" tag to the spec file (currently it doesn't have any comments with reasoning, bug ID, or whether it's an UPSTREAM/OPENSUSE/SUSE patch). ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c0)  Tobias Mueller    2015-11-20 14:25:12 UTC  ``` From a bug report via email (Credit go to Fernando Arnaboldi)  The affected products are using a random function that returns a fixed value.  Random values are a set of values whose elements that have equal probability of occurrence. In this context, this set of elements is numbers between 0 and 1.  The problem lies in that the library returns always the same value since it is not using a random initialization vector. Therefore, without distinction on where is executed (python, php, or with xsltproc), the pattern of values will be always the same.   I found the following patch (<https://mail.gnome.org/archives/commits-list/2013-February/msg06493.html>) related to the random functionality of xsltproc. However, I the random function in libxslt should be the one providing by default a random number. Furthermore, it should use by default an initialization vector and not the other way around. Developers may be using a fixed numbers instead of a "random number from 0 to 1â as the documentation states (<http://exslt.org/math/functions/random/index.html>). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c1)  Marcus Meissner    2017-04-04 14:30:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 349240](attachment.cgi?id=349240 "libxslt-random-seed.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=349240&action=edit "libxslt-random-seed.patch") [[review]](review?bug=758400&attachment=349240) libxslt-random-seed.patch  seed randonmness on first call of random  it uses /dev/urandom with fallback of time() ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c2)  Petr    2017-04-05 08:08:34 UTC  ``` Tested the above patch with xsltproc (even without the commit referenced in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c0)) and php-xsl and it works for me. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c3)  Marcus Meissner    2017-04-06 05:42:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2015-9019 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c4)  Remi Gacogne    2017-04-06 08:17:13 UTC  ``` If I'm not mistaken, we should read from then close fd if it's different from -1, not equal to. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c5)  Hanno BÃ¶ck    2017-04-06 08:40:10 UTC  ``` Hi, this just went over oss-security, I'll repost the comments (+ one more thought I only had after the mail) I posted there here:  1. What's the use of the random number and what's the security impact if it's not random? That's not explained. In case a cryptographically secure random number is required then using rand()/srand() is a bad idea anyway. (Unfortunately there's no secure random in the standard libc, but at least glibc now has getrandom.).  2. This part of the patch looks a bit strange:  +	seed = time(NULL); /* just in case /dev/urandom is not there */ +	if (fd == -1) { +		read (fd, &seed, sizeof(seed)); +		close (fd); +	}  You're calling time() unconditionally, although it's kinda just a fallback. Why not +	if (fd == -1) { +		read (fd, &seed, sizeof(seed)); +		close (fd); +	} else { +		seed = time(NULL); +	} ?  (obviously using time is not a secure way to do random numbers, if secure numbers are required cross-plattform you need to do this otherwise anyway)  3. calling srand() from a library is considered bad practice. Sometimes applications expect a deterministic behavior of random(). (In other cases calling srand() unexpectedly was considered a security vuln, see CVE-2012-6702 in expat) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c6)  John Haxby    2020-02-12 12:20:36 UTC  ``` In the light of the previous comment, would it not make sense to close this as NOT-A-BUG and, if possible. have CVE-2015-9019 rejected? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=758400#c7)  GNOME Infrastructure Team    2021-07-05 11:01:01 UTC  ``` GNOME is going to shut down bugzilla.gnome.org in favor of gitlab.gnome.org. As part of that, we are mass-closing older open tickets in bugzilla.gnome.org which have not seen updates for a longer time (resources are unfortunately quite limited so not every ticket can get handled).  If you can still reproduce the situation described in this ticket in a recent and supported software version, then please follow   <https://wiki.gnome.org/GettingInTouch/BugReportingGuidelines> and create a new ticket at   <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/issues/>  Thank you for your understanding and your help. ``` |  |

Hi,

the following vulnerability was published for libxslt.

[CVE-2015-9019](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-9019)[0]:
| In libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier, the EXSLT math.random function was not
| initialized with a random seed during startup, which could cause usage
| of this function to produce predictable outputs.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:
