{
  "CVE-2015-9019": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The EXSLT math.random function in libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier was not initialized with a random seed during startup, leading to predictable outputs.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `math.random` function in libxslt was not properly initialized with a random seed, causing it to produce the same sequence of numbers each time it was used.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Predictable random number generation"
      ],
      "impact": "The predictable output of `math.random` can be exploited in scenarios where random numbers are used for security purposes. For example, if the output is used to generate keys or nonces, an attacker may be able to predict those values and potentially compromise the system.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker would exploit the lack of proper seeding by relying on the predictable output of the `math:random()` function. This could be through XSLT stylesheets or applications utilizing the vulnerable library.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide input that results in the `math:random()` function being called within the affected libxslt library. This could be through crafting specific XSLT stylesheets or controlling input to applications using the library."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier"
    ],
	"patch": "The fix involves seeding the random number generator using `/dev/urandom` if available, with a fallback to using the system time if `/dev/urandom` is not available.",
	"additional_notes": "While the fix addresses the immediate issue of predictable randomness, the discussion in the bug reports indicates that `math.random()` is not intended for cryptographic purposes. Applications needing cryptographic randomness should use a cryptographically secure random number generator instead of relying on `math.random()`."
