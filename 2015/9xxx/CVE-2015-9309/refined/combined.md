I look after a client’s website which I inherited along with the installed WP Maps plugin so I was unfamiliar with it. After many months and regular updates something knocked out the map and it stopped working. I tried everything I coudl think of but could not get teh map back again.
So I contacted support.
They jumped on the issue right away. They logged into the site and made the necessary change to make the map work again. They switched my page from using a Widget to display the map to a Raw Code block using the map shortcode. (About the only thing I didn’t try).
It is always refreshing to experience support to this high standard when you need it. I was very impressed. Thank you for your help. And this was on the plugin’s free version.

I’ve installed the plugin on 2 websites, creating some interactive maps with listings. First I had problems with the maps working correctly, but after I contacted support, they helped me and fixed the problem. Some caching plugin interfered with WP Maps. Now everything is working perfectly.
Thank you
