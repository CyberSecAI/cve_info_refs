Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the prettyPhoto library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DOM XSS vulnerability. This occurs when the application's client-side JavaScript code handles user-supplied input in a way that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which is then executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they interact with content using the vulnerable version of the library. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious javascript into user-supplied data and then using the vulnerable prettyPhoto javascript to execute that malicious javascript on the client side.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into the user-supplied data that is processed by the prettyPhoto library. The attacker may need to target a website that uses this library or control some of the content used by the library.

**Additional Details:**
- The content references a specific issue ([#149](https://github.com/scaron/prettyphoto/issues/149)) and a blog post detailing a DOM XSS vulnerability in the prettyPhoto plugin. The fix is mentioned in the release notes for version 3.1.6.
- There is evidence that the vulnerability was exploited in the wild.
- The issue was reported as early as July 2014, and a fix was released in May 2015.
