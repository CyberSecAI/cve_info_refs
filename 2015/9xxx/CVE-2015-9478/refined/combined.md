## Description

[![@anantshri](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/236843?u=83f5003313af65ab6e47ee79463d507f22da02f7&v=4&size=48)](/anantshri)[anantshri](https://github.com/anantshri)opened [on May 5, 2015](https://github.com/scaron/prettyphoto/issues/149#issue-73274231)

Someone reported a Dom XSS vector in 07-2014

<http://www.perucrack.net/2014/07/haciendo-un-xss-en-plugin-prettyphoto.html>

I can see evidences of this issue being exploited in wild. Can you suggest when a fix would be ready.

Created a public issue coz the disclosure was long back but still a lot of people are using this library and all of them are susceptible to this attack.
