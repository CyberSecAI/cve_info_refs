The provided content is related to CVE-2015-9373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress plugins. Plugin developers incorrectly assumed that these functions would automatically escape user input, which is not the case. This led to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in many plugins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unescaped user input in URL query parameters.
- Incorrect assumptions about the behavior of WordPress functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing web pages
    - Other unauthorized actions

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious crafted URLs with unescaped user input in query parameters.
- An attacker can craft a URL that exploits the vulnerability and trick a user into clicking it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to click the malicious link, typically via social engineering or other means.
- No special privileges are required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
