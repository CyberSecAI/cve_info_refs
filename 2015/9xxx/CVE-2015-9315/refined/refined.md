The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "NewStatPress". While it doesn't directly describe a CVE, it does mention several security fixes in its changelog that could be related to past vulnerabilities. Specifically, it mentions fixes for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are common types of security issues.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant security information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    *   Multiple mentions of XSS fixes:
        *   Version 1.0.4: "Close a persistent XSS via HTTP-Header (Referer) (no authentication required)"
        *   Version 1.0.5: "Close a XSS and a SQLI Injection involved IMG tag"
        *   Version 1.0.6: "Close a possible Reflected XSS attack"
        *   Version 1.2.5: "Fix Stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities"
    *   These indicate the presence of both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities in earlier versions of the plugin.
    *   The XSS vulnerabilities were found in various contexts: HTTP Referer header, IMG tag, and other unspecified locations.

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Multiple mentions of SQL injection fixes:
        *   Version 1.0.1: "Close a SQL injection"
        *  Version 1.0.5: "Close a XSS and a SQLI Injection involved IMG tag"
        *   Version 0.9.9: "Close a XSS and a SQL injection and possible other more complex to achieve"
        *   Versions 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5 "Improving on preventing potential SQL injection"
    * These indicate the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in earlier versions of the plugin.
    *  The SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in the search routine and possibly other areas.
        
**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user input. This includes data from HTTP headers (Referer), user-provided data for search queries, and potentially other input vectors such as widget variables and API calls. The plugin was based on an older plugin "StatPress" which had these vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin's output. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Steal user session cookies
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Deface the website
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL queries to:
    *   Gain access to sensitive database information
    *   Modify or delete data in the database
    *   Potentially gain control over the server (in severe cases)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Referer Header:** Manipulating the Referer header in HTTP requests.
*   **Search Functionality:** Providing malicious input into the search feature.
*   **IMG Tags:** Injecting malicious code into IMG tags.
*   **Widget Variables:** Exploiting user-provided variables in the widget.
*   **External API:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the external API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **XSS:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests or inject malicious code into user-provided fields.
*   **SQL Injection:** Ability to craft SQL injection payloads.  May require some knowledge of the database structure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The changelog entries show a clear effort by the developers to address the security issues through sanitization and input validation.
*   The plugin explicitly states that versions prior to 1.0.6 are vulnerable to XSS and SQL injection, emphasizing the importance of updating to the latest version.
