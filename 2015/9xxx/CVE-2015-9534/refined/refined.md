The provided content is a blog post about a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads, a WordPress plugin. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions where the third parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper URL escaping: The code was not properly escaping URLs passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`. These WordPress functions build URLs by adding parameters. If the URL provided as a parameter is not escaped, it could be manipulated by an attacker to perform unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The blog post does not specifically detail the exact impact, but unescaped URLs in these functions can lead to various issues, including:
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker might be able to inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted URL which gets executed when a user clicks on the link.
  - **Open Redirection:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL with injected code or a malicious redirect target.
- The attacker would need to find a place in the application where an unescaped URL is passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`.
- The attacker would then need to make the victim visit the crafted malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft URLs
- Knowledge of where vulnerable code exists within the application
- Ability to get a user to click on the malicious link
