- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress plugins. These functions were used without proper sanitization/escaping of user input. Plugin developers incorrectly assumed these functions would automatically escape user input, leading to the injection of malicious code via URL query parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of proper sanitization of user input allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website through URL parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to various attacks like redirection, stealing user session cookies, and defacing websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that contain malicious JavaScript code in the query parameters. These URLs could be spread through various means such as phishing emails or malicious links on other websites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick users into clicking on them. They do not require any special access to the server.
