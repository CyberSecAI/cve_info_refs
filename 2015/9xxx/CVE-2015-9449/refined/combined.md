By auto sharing your old blog posts, you keep them alive and increase traffic to your blog!

**Additionally Filter posts** to be published/cross posted to social networks based on categories.

(General section settings)

**Multiple Accounts per social site supported.**

Possibility to nicely format the posted message per account, **shortcodes supported**.

**Logs are generated** each time there is an auto posting activity for each configured social network account.

**twitter.com accounts** [Help with screenshots](https://efficientscripts.com/web/microblogposter/twitter-auto-publish "Twitter auto publish help with screenshots.")

Your Twitter username and password won’t suffice in order to post automatic updates, Twitter API requires some more steps described below.

No worries, it’s rather a simple procedure.

```
1. In order to auto post updates through the Twitter API you'll need
to create your own Twitter App here: https://apps.twitter.com/

2. Once you have created your Twitter App you have to change its Access Level
to be Read and Write.
Browse to the settings tab and click on 'Modify App Permissions'.
Check the Access Level to be Read and Write. Save your Settings.

3. Once this is done return to the API Keys tab, at the bottom you
should have a button 'Create My Access token', please do it.

4. Now, on the API Keys tab you have all what you need,
i.e. API (Consumer) key / secret, Access token and Access token secret.

5. If you don't see immediately the Access Token at the bottom,
please refresh the API Keys tab page.

```

**plurk.com accounts** [Help with screenshots](https://efficientscripts.com/web/microblogposter/plurk-auto-publish "Plurk auto publish help with screenshots.")

```
1. Please browse to this url http://www.plurk.com/PlurkApp/
and click on 'Create a New Plurk App'.
For App Type choose 'Third-party web site integration'.
For App Website you can put http://localhost

*Token Key and Token Secret* by clicking on

## FAQ

### My blog is hosted on shared hosting, can I use MicroblogPoster?

Warning about inherent php script execution time limitation that some Hosting Providers apply on shared accounts (max\_execution\_time PHP setting).

Since *MicroblogPoster* needs time to update all your social accounts when publishing a new blog post, this limit might be reached and script execution stopped.

In order to avoid it, please limit the number of social accounts based on your environment script execution time limit.

### The PHP cURL extension is required?

Yes, otherwise the plugin simply won’t function at all.

Seemed promising but not working anymore. You can do some config but it’s not possible to link social media accounts. Seems like there weren’t any updates in many years. (Google+ still listed for instance)

Jumped through the hoops of setting it up for pintrest. Authorized the app, set everything up per the instructions. 3 days later, still no post has been pinned to pintrest boards.

Hi, When posting to Google Blogger(blogspot.com) the tags/labels do not appear at the bottom of the post.
I have tried {labels} as well as {tags}.
Any ideas? Will this be fixed?
Thanks
