The provided content describes a security vulnerability in the Microblog Poster WordPress plugin version 1.6.0, specifically a blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `microblogposter_settings_output()` function in `/microblog-poster/microblogposter_options.php` file, specifically around line 543.
- The `account_id` parameter, received via a POST request, is not sanitized properly before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL injection: The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `account_id` parameter. The injection is blind, meaning the attacker doesn't receive direct error messages, but can infer the results of the injected SQL using time-based techniques (e.g., `SLEEP()`).
- No CSRF protection: The vulnerability can be exploited without any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the WordPress database. This could lead to a wide range of impacts, including:
    - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data from the database.
    - Data modification: Altering data, including user accounts and configurations.
    - Complete compromise: Potentially gaining full access to the WordPress site by exploiting the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=microblogposter.php`.
- The `account_id` parameter is the vulnerable entry point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send POST requests to the vulnerable URL.

**Additional Details**
- The provided content includes proof of concept using sqlmap.
- The content also states "Urgent, fixing possible SQL injection." which is referenced in the 24th of July 2015 and the 23rd of July 2015 changelog entries. The version number referenced in the changelog as fixing the vulnerability is 1.6.2 which is different from the vulnerable version 1.6.0 as specified in the title of the email containing the vulnerability information.
