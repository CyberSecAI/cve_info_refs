Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) plugin for WordPress without properly escaping URLs passed as the third parameter. Specifically, if an untrusted or unescaped URL is used as the third parameter, it can lead to a security vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of URLs when adding or removing query arguments.
- **Open Redirect:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL and inject it into the query arguments via the vulnerable functions. If this crafted URL is not escaped, it could redirect users to an attacker-controlled website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users could be redirected to phishing sites or websites hosting malware, which could lead to data theft, malware infection, or other malicious activities.
- **Potential for Phishing Attacks:** By redirecting users to fake login pages, attackers could steal credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** Attackers can craft a malicious URL that, when passed as the third parameter to vulnerable `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions, injects a redirect into the site's URL generation logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Influence URL Parameters:** Attackers need the ability to pass or inject the crafted URL into the vulnerable functions. This can be done via any input vector that the vulnerable function relies on.
- **No Special Permissions:** Exploitation doesn't require administrative or privileged access to the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to how the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions are used within Easy Digital Downloads. The issue is not inherent to these WordPress functions themselves but arises when the third parameter is not properly sanitized.
- The fix involved ensuring that the third parameter passed to the function is an escaped or trusted URL.
- The blog post confirms that not all instances of these functions were vulnerable; only those where the 3rd parameter was an unescaped URL.

This information provides more details than a typical CVE description by outlining the specific vulnerable functions, the nature of the vulnerability (URL manipulation leading to open redirect), and the specific fix.
