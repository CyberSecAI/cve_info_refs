Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the fix:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The plugin was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   The `HTTP_REFERER` header was being used directly without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The plugin was not sanitizing the `$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']` value before using it. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the Referer header which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when the plugin displayed this value.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites
    *   Deface the website
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could craft a malicious URL that contains a JavaScript payload within the Referer header.
*   By tricking a user to click this URL the malicious Referer would be passed to the vulnerable website and allow execution of the malicious script.
*   Alternatively, if an attacker can control the referer header of a request to the vulnerable server, they can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with a malicious Referer header or to manipulate the Referer header directly.
*   The attacker would need to trick a user into accessing this crafted URL, or alternatively, if the attacker has control over the referer header of requests to the server, then can directly trigger the vulnerability.

**Code Changes:**

*   The vulnerable code: `$referrer = (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])?$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']:'');`
*   The fix: `$referrer = (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])?esc_url($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']):'');`
*   The fix uses `esc_url()` function to sanitize the `HTTP_REFERER` value before using it, mitigating the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The changelog entry in `readme.txt` explicitly mentions "XSS vulnerability fix".
*   The version was updated from `0.9.9b` to `0.9.10b` with this fix.
*   The plugin is closed as of December 21, 2017 and is no longer available for download, according to the plugin page.
