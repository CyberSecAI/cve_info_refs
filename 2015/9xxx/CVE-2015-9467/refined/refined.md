Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2015-9467:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the "Broken Link Manager" WordPress plugin, specifically in the `wpslDelURL()` and `wpslEditURL()` functions located in `/broken-link-manager/config/functions.php`. These functions failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, the `page` parameter was also vulnerable to Reflected XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Blind SQL injection:**
    *   Vulnerable function: `wpslDelURL()`
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `url` (GET parameter)
    *   The `url` parameter in the `wpslDelURL` function was not sanitized before being used in a database query.
    *   Vulnerable function: `wpslEditURL()`
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `url` (POST parameter)
    *   The `url` parameter in the `wpslEditURL` function was not sanitized before being used in a database query.

2.  **Reflected XSS:**
    *   Vulnerable function: `/broken-link-manager/config/functions.php`
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `page` (GET parameter)
    *   The `page` parameter was not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of JavaScript code that would be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive data)
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    *   Privilege escalation (gaining administrative access)
    *   Complete compromise of the website.
2.  **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Defacement of the website

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The `wpslDelURL()` function is vulnerable via a crafted GET request to `?delURL=1&url=[SQLi]`.
    *   The `wpslEditURL()` function is vulnerable via a crafted POST request to `?editURL=1` with the SQL payload in the `url` parameter.
2.  **Reflected XSS:**
    *   The XSS vulnerability can be exploited with a crafted GET request to `?delURL=1&url=1&page=[XSS payload]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely. They can craft GET/POST requests with malicious SQL payloads.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to lure a user to click on a crafted link containing the malicious JavaScript payload. This requires some form of social engineering or delivering the link via other means such as email or another website.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed due to security issues and is no longer available for download, which is likely a direct response to the vulnerabilities mentioned.
*   The provided content from cinu.pl provides more technical detail than a typical CVE description.
*   The identified vulnerabilities affect version 0.4.5 of the Broken Link Manager plugin.
*   The plugin hasn't been updated for 9 years, indicating that the issue may remain unpatched if the plugin was installed in older wordpress instances.
