Generates good terms and conditions. But don’t leave it enabled because it causes Woocommerce not to work in incognito mode, it causes a ton of redirects on loading your page that can add up to 4 extra seconds of load time on mobile (!!), just wreaks havoc with your install for some reason. And it caused my page to flicker and not load on mobile also. JUST causes a mess on the frontend. It’s really weird and there’s no reason for it. But the terms are good, they get generated but make sure you disable the plugin after.

It worked fine for a few months, then I had trouble with “WP Legal Pages Compliance Platform Cannot activate API Key. No API Resources available.” I reached out to their customer service and never heard back.
