Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the "Users Ultra" WordPress plugin. Specifically, when users create or modify subscription packages, the plugin fails to sanitize the package name and description fields before saving them to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code into the package name and/or description fields. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the membership page or when the package information is displayed on the front end.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the browser of any user viewing the affected pages.
- **Account Compromise:** If an administrator views the injected JavaScript, the attacker can potentially use this to steal session cookies, perform actions as the administrator or redirect them to malicious sites.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could inject code to modify the content of the page, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** A user sends a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `p_name` parameter (or potentially the package description).
- **Viewing Affected Pages:** The malicious code is executed when an administrator visits the membership page in the admin panel or when any user views the page displaying the package information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user within the WordPress site to access the functionality to create or modify subscription packages
- **Ability to make POST requests**: The attacker has to be able to craft a specific POST request to the admin-ajax.php file

**Additional Details:**

- The identified version of the plugin vulnerable to this attack is 1.5.50.
- The plugin was tested on WordPress 4.3.1
- The vendor was notified of this vulnerability but no official fix was available at the time of the report.
