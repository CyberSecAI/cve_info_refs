Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from the usage of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress without properly escaping the URL passed as the third parameter. These functions are used to manipulate query parameters in URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unescaped URLs:** If the third parameter of these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL, it can be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious code or redirect users to a different site.
- **Open Redirect:** Specifically, the vulnerability is an open redirect. The vulnerability exists when the 3rd parameter passed to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions is an unescaped/untrusted URL. This allows an attacker to craft a URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to a malicious site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Redirection to malicious sites:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website, which could potentially lead to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other forms of malicious activity.
- **Compromise of user data:** If the malicious site is designed to mimic the original site, it could trick users into providing their credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the URL parameters that are passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` in order to inject their own malicious redirect URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated or have special permissions. They can exploit the vulnerability if they can control the URL, specifically the third parameter to those WordPress functions, such as through malicious links or by manipulating requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The comments mention that not all uses of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` are vulnerable. Only those where the third parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL pose a risk.
- The fix was deployed automatically, suggesting the developers are aware of the risk of exploitation and have taken steps to remediate quickly.
