{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress plugins. Developers incorrectly assumed these functions would automatically escape user input, leading to unescaped data in URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization/escaping when using `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious code injected into the query string.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs with malicious parameters. The attacker could leverage social engineering to get a user to click the link, or use other means to trick a victim's browser into requesting a malicious link.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was discovered by Joost from Yoast and Sucuri.  The article mentions that a large number of popular plugins were affected. The issue was resolved via coordinated disclosure with plugin developers, and updated versions of the affected plugins were released. The article provides a list of affected plugins. The recommendation was to update all vulnerable plugins and to use `esc_url()` or `esc_url_raw()` to sanitize URL parameters when using `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions."
