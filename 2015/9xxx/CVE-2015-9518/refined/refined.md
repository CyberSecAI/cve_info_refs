The provided content discusses a security fix released for the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress when the third parameter (a URL) passed to these functions is not properly escaped. Specifically, if an unescaped or untrusted URL is used in the third parameter, it can lead to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core vulnerability is a URL parameter injection vulnerability. If the URL passed to `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code or redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL and inject it into the vulnerable parameter, causing users to be redirected to a malicious site. This can lead to phishing attacks or malware installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  By manipulating URL parameters or by injecting malicious URLs into the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to find an instance of the vulnerable code where the third parameter of `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` is not properly escaped and is derived from user input or some other external source.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL passed as a third parameter to the vulnerable functions. This might be through a user-controllable input or some form of data injection.
