Hello,I have translated into French the English sentences of “Erident Custom Login and Dashboard”. I did the translation with “Poedit”. But after transferring the two files “.mo” and “.po” on my website, the sentences in English still appear. I would like these sentences to be in French. Could you help me?Thank you in advance for your answer.Kidbert.

It was simple and effective. I guess that’s why the latest version eliminated both of those things.

After eight years using this plugin on dozens of sites, I can’t find another custom login plugin so reliable, simple and lean.

Great plug-in – my guess is it would have 500,000 downloads if it had a marketing machine behind it. I search high and low for something similar the better part of a month and this little gem never surfaced in google or any other blog. If you want a clean look and redirects for the standard WP login/ register pages look no further. Simple enough for a novice to nail down in an hour of tweaking.
Thanks and great job!
