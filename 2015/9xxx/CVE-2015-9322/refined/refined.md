The provided content is a description of the "Erident Custom Login and Dashboard" WordPress plugin from the WordPress plugin directory. While it does mention a security fix in version 3.5.9, the description of the fix is too generic to be used for CVE analysis.

Specifically, the changelog entry states:

*   **3.5.9 (01 Apr 2021)**
    *   XSS Security Fix
    *   Compatibility with latest WordPress version

Based on the limited information, here's what can be inferred:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is not specified but it is related to an XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability was present in the plugin.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is typical of XSS vulnerabilities, which could include:
    *   Executing malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-supplied data or input that was not properly sanitized or escaped, leading to the XSS vulnerability.
*    **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to inject malicious code into a vulnerable field or parameter, possibly within the settings of the plugin or through another entry point if the plugin did not sanitize user input properly. 

Given the lack of specifics about the XSS vulnerability, the information above is all that can be extracted.
