Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2015-9452:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of blind SQL injection vulnerabilities exist within the NEX-Forms plugin. These are present in the following functions:
    *   `generate_csv()` (unauthenticated): Exploitable through the `nex_forms_Id` parameter.
    *   `IZC_Database::populate_dropdown_list()` (authenticated): Exploitable through the `table` and `Id` parameters.
    *   `IZC_Template::get_total_records()` params: `table`, `nex_forms_id`, `additional_params`
    *   `IZC_Database::do_insert()` params: `table`
    *   `submit_nex_form()` params: `nex_forms_id`
    *   `IZC_Database::list_items()` params: `table`
    *   `NEXForms_admin::build_form_data_table()` params: `form_Id`
    *   `NEXForms_form_entries::get_total_form_entries` params: `wa_form_Id`
    *   `Plugin_Admin::add_new()` params: `Id`
    *   `IZC_Database::load_nex_form_attr()` params: `form_Id`
    *    `IZC_Database::load_nex_form_hidden_fields` params: `form_Id`
    *    `IZC_Database::delete_record` params: `Id`
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The content mentions that there seems to be a lack of administrator privilege checks, which allows any authenticated user to potentially modify or interact with the forms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, form data, and potentially administrative credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** If the database contains sensitive information such as passwords or session keys, an attacker might gain elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** By crafting specific SQL injections, attackers might be able to cause errors, slow down queries, or potentially crash the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** Vulnerable parameters are passed through HTTP GET and POST requests.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** Specifically, `nex_forms_Id`, `table`, and `Id` parameters in different plugin functions are vulnerable.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `generate_csv()` vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The `IZC_Database::populate_dropdown_list()` vulnerability requires authentication, but due to the lack of admin privilege checks, any authenticated user can exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and injection techniques.
*   **Unauthenticated Exploit:** For `generate_csv()`, no authentication is required
*   **Authenticated User:** For other functions, the attacker needs to be logged in as an authenticated WordPress user (any level user can exploit the vulnerability).

**Additional Details:**
The provided content includes SQLmap and curl commands demonstrating how the vulnerabilities can be exploited, confirming that they are not just theoretical.  It also identifies many potentially vulnerable functions that were not fully tested, indicating a significant security flaw.
