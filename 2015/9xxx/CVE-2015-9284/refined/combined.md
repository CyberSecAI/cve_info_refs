This is the documentation for the in-development branch of OmniAuth.
You can find the documentation for the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/tree/v2.1.2)

## An Introduction

OmniAuth is a library that standardizes multi-provider authentication for
web applications. It was created to be powerful, flexible, and do as
little as possible. Any developer can create **strategies** for OmniAuth
that can authenticate users via disparate systems. OmniAuth strategies
have been created for everything from Facebook to LDAP.

In order to use OmniAuth in your applications, you will need to leverage
one or more strategies. These strategies are generally released
individually as RubyGems, and you can see a [community maintained list](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies)
on the wiki for this project.

One strategy, called `Developer`, is included with OmniAuth and provides
a completely insecure, non-production-usable strategy that directly
prompts a user for authentication information and then passes it
straight through. You can use it as a placeholder when you start
development and easily swap in other strategies later.

## Getting Started

Each OmniAuth strategy is a Rack Middleware. That means that you can use
it the same way that you use any other Rack middleware. For example, to
use the built-in Developer strategy in a Sinatra application you might
do this:

```
require 'sinatra'
require 'omniauth'

class MyApplication < Sinatra::Base
  use Rack::Session::Cookie
  use OmniAuth::Strategies::Developer
end
```

Because OmniAuth is built for *multi-provider* authentication, you may
want to leave room to run multiple strategies. For this, the built-in
`OmniAuth::Builder` class gives you an easy way to specify multiple
strategies. Note that there is **no difference** between the following
code and using each strategy individually as middleware. This is an
example that you might put into a Rails initializer at
`config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :developer unless Rails.env.production?
  provider :twitter, ENV['TWITTER_KEY'], ENV['TWITTER_SECRET']
end
```

You should look to the documentation for each provider you use for
specific initialization requirements.

## Integrating OmniAuth Into Your Application

OmniAuth is an extremely low-touch library. It is designed to be a
black box that you can send your application's users into when you need
authentication and then get information back. OmniAuth was intentionally
built not to automatically associate with a User model or make
assumptions about how many authentication methods you might want to use
or what you might want to do with the data once a user has
authenticated. This makes OmniAuth incredibly flexible. To use OmniAuth,
you need only to redirect users to `/auth/:provider`, where `:provider`
is the name of the strategy (for example, `developer` or `twitter`).
From there, OmniAuth will take over and take the user through the
necessary steps to authenticate them with the chosen strategy.

Once the user has authenticated, what do you do next? OmniAuth simply
sets a special hash called the Authentication Hash on the Rack
environment of a request to `/auth/:provider/callback`. This hash
contains as much information about the user as OmniAuth was able to
glean from the utilized strategy. You should set up an endpoint in your
application that matches to the callback URL and then performs whatever
steps are necessary for your application.

The `omniauth.auth` key in the environment hash provides an
Authentication Hash which will contain information about the just
authenticated user including a unique id, the strategy they just used
for authentication, and personal details such as name and email address
as available. For an in-depth description of what the authentication
hash might contain, see the [Auth Hash Schema wiki page](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema).

Note that OmniAuth does not perform any actions beyond setting some
environment information on the callback request. It is entirely up to
you how you want to implement the particulars of your application's
authentication flow.

## rack\_csrf

`omniauth` is not OOTB-compatible with [rack\_csrf](https://github.com/baldowl/rack_csrf). In order to do so, the following code needs to be added to the application bootstrapping code:

```
OmniAuth::AuthenticityTokenProtection.default_options(key: "csrf.token", authenticity_param: "_csrf")
```

## Rails (without Devise)

To get started, add the following gems

**Gemfile**:

```
gem 'omniauth'
gem "omniauth-rails_csrf_protection"
```

Then insert OmniAuth as a middleware

**config/initializers/omniauth.rb**:

```
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :developer if Rails.env.development?
end
```

Additional providers can be added here in the future. Next we wire it
all up using routes, a controller and a login view.

**config/routes.rb**:

```
  get 'auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'
  get '/login', to: 'sessions#new'
```

**app/controllers/sessions\_controller.rb**:

```
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    render :new
  end

  def create
    user_info = request.env['omniauth.auth']
    raise user_info # Your own session management should be placed here.
  end
end
```

**app/views/sessions/new.html.erb**:

```
<%= form_tag('/auth/developer', method: 'post', data: {turbo: false}) do %>
  <button type='submit'>Login with Developer</button>
<% end %>
```

Now if you visit `/login` and click the Login button, you should see the
OmniAuth developer login screen. After submitting it, you are returned to your
application at `Sessions#create`. The raise should now display all the Omniauth
details you have available to integrate it into your own user management.

If you want out of the box usermanagement, you should consider using Omniauth
through Devise. Please visit the [Devise Github page](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#omniauth)
for more information.

## Rails API

The following middleware are (by default) included for session management in
Rails applications. When using OmniAuth with a Rails API, you'll need to add
one of these required middleware back in:

* `ActionDispatch::Session::CacheStore`
* `ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore`
* `ActionDispatch::Session::MemCacheStore`

The trick to adding these back in is that, by default, they are passed
`session_options` when added (including the session key), so you can't just add
a `session_store.rb` initializer, add `use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore`
and have sessions functioning as normal.

To be clear: sessions may work, but your session options will be ignored
(i.e. the session key will default to `_session_id`). Instead of the
initializer, you'll have to set the relevant options somewhere
before your middleware is built (like `application.rb`) and pass them to your
preferred middleware, like this:

**application.rb:**

```
config.session_store :cookie_store, key: '_interslice_session'
config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Cookies # Required for all session management
config.middleware.use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore, config.session_options
```

(Thanks @mltsy)

## Logging

OmniAuth supports a configurable logger. By default, OmniAuth will log
to `STDOUT` but you can configure this using `OmniAuth.config.logger`:

```
# Rails application example
OmniAuth.config.logger = Rails.logger
```

## Origin Param

The `origin` url parameter is typically used to inform where a user came from
and where, should you choose to use it, they'd want to return to.
Omniauth supports the following settings which can be configured on a provider level:

**Default**:

```
provider :twitter, ENV['KEY'], ENV['SECRET']
POST /auth/twitter/?origin=[URL]
# If the `origin` parameter is blank, `omniauth.origin` is set to HTTP_REFERER
```

**Using a differently named origin parameter**:

```
provider :twitter, ENV['KEY'], ENV['SECRET'], origin_param: 'return_to'
POST /auth/twitter/?return_to=[URL]
# If the `return_to` parameter is blank, `omniauth.origin` is set to HTTP_REFERER
```

**Disabled**:

```
provider :twitter, ENV['KEY'], ENV['SECRET'], origin_param: false
POST /auth/twitter
# This means the origin should be handled by your own application.
# Note that `omniauth.origin` will always be blank.
```

## Resources

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Violations
of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch
version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be
immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be
introduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and
should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version
Constraint](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint) with two digits of precision. For example:

```
spec.add_dependency 'omniauth', '~> 1.0'

```

See [omniauth/omniauth#809](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809) for background.

There's a lot of duplication between this and [Rails's request\_forgery\_protection.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.1/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/request_forgery_protection.rb), but I don't see a way around that right now as Rails doesn't expose the `RequestForgeryProtection` functionality in any way that doesn't depend on the controller context.

Implementations of `RequestForgeryProtection` are included for Rails 3.2, 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2. I've only had time to test with Rails 4.1 yet.

| How can we be confident that this actually fixes what it’s supposed to?  We can't, I agree we should have tests. [request\_forgery\_protection\_test.rb](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.1/actionpack/test/controller/request_forgery_protection_test.rb) may come in useful.  I'll see if I can fit it into my schedule today or tomorrow, but unfortunately I have very little time this week. |

| [@sferik](https://github.com/sferik) Unfortunately not. I've got an exam on Monday, and I don't think my professor will find the fact that I'd rather be working on getting a vulnerability patch out of the door a good enough reason to postpone it. I won't have time to look into tests until June 2nd. |

The code in here is now pretty outdated, and we'd probably be better off with a solution that uses Rails's public interface instead of copy-pasting a bunch of Rails internals that may change from version to version, so I've closed this PR in the hope someone will create a new one we can actually move forward with. |

### @switzersc-usds **[switzersc-usds](/switzersc-usds)** commented [Sep 5, 2019](#issue-489804696)

**Why**

We need to make sure that we're mitigating the Cross Site Scripting

Forgery vulnerability by using a POST method to initiate the Omniauth

flow. For more info:

<https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284>

[omniauth/omniauth#809](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809)

**What Changed**

* Add a gem that enforces using `post` only with oauth initiation requests
* Change out github link to use the `post` method

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Ok, I was able to dismiss the security warning via the 'fix has already been started' option. Not sure that's the best approach, but should work for now. I agree, we need better automated checking on PRs. |

## Description

[![@bgwilson87](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2334297?v=4&size=48)](/bgwilson87)[bgwilson87](https://github.com/bgwilson87)opened [on May 29, 2019](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/960#issue-450007144)

I received a security vulnerability alert from GitHub for omniauth, I am using 1.9.0

"The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing accounts to be connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback to the user. This permits a secondary account to be able to sign into the web application as the primary account."

### @DouweM **[DouweM](/DouweM)** commented [May 25, 2015](#issue-80451277) • edited Loading

TL;DR, as of 2020-03-07:

> Please note: there is currently a CSRF vulnerability which affects OmniAuth (designated [CVE-2015-9284](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9284)) that requires mitigation at the application level. More details on how to do this can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).

Original issue description:

---

The request phase in OmniAuth is currently vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery, which allows an attacker to easily gain full access to a user's account on a site that uses OmniAuth, when used in combination with another CSRF vulnerability on the side of a connected OAuth provider.

This vulnerability was reported to us (GitLab) by Mohamed Abdelbaset Elnoby ([@SymbianSyMoh](https://github.com/SymbianSyMoh)), a Senior Information Security Analyst at [Seekurity.com](http://seekurity.com), on April 23rd. On April 24th, we reported it to the OmniAuth team via email. On May 14th, we [merged our patch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/c2ee828c19cb245809647428334b8ef215536a0d) into the public GitLab repository.

Mr. Elnoby also gave us an example of an OAuth provider that had the CSRF vulnerability on their side that is needed to make this attack "weaponizable". The vulnerability has been reported to them.

The below description of the issue is written from GitLab’s perspective.

> Connecting the GitLab account to an OAuth provider like Google works like this:
>
> 1. User visits <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google>
> 2. User is redirected to a page on Google
> 3. Google checks if the user is logged in
> 4. If the user is logged in, Google checks if the user has authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account
> 5. If the user has authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account, Google redirects back to GitLab
> 6. GitLab adds the Google account to the GitLab account as an alternate identity, which means the Google account can be used to log into the GitLab account.
>
> This is all very straightforward, and works as expected.
>
> Note that if the Google user has already authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account, there is no user action needed to link the two accounts, apart from the initial <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google> visit.
>
> This means that if you can get a person who 1) is signed into Google, 2) has authorized the GitLab.com application to use it, and 3) is signed into GitLab.com, to visit <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google>, their account will be linked to the Google account without any further interaction, and without any feedback to the user.
>
> This is not a big deal if the signed in Google account belongs to the GitLab user themselves, but it is if the user is somehow signed into Google using an account belonging to an attacker. In this scenario, the GitLab account would be linked to the attacker's Google account, and the GitLab user would be none the wiser.
>
> And let it just so be the case that that iss possible with *Redacted*: there exists a vulnerability on their side that allows an attacker to log into *Redacted* using CSRF, which means that if a user visits a specially crafted page, they will end up being logged into *Redacted* as the attacker.
>
> Combining this with the described GitLab.com flow, forcing the victim to visit that specially crafted page, and directly after that, forcing them to visit <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/redacted> (by using an iframe, for example), will give the attacker full control over the victim's GitLab account. "Forcing them" can be as simple as sending them a link over email and getting them to click it.

To actually use the POST method rather than GET so the CSRF token is sent along, we have changed our links to the auth path from:

```
link_to "Log in with #{provider}", omniauth_authorize_path(:user, provider)
```

to:

```
link_to "Log in with #{provider}", omniauth_authorize_path(:user, provider), method: :post
```

Note that the current implementation is very specific to Rails. It needs to be, as far as I can see, since the CSRF protection needs to use the web framework’s authenticity token.

I suggest deprecating `OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods` and only allowing `:post` from now on, but I haven't made that change yet since I think it warrants more discussion.

People that use OmniAuth with Rails will need to change the `link_to` helpers and `<form>` tags in their own code to use `POST` instead of `GET`,

so I’m afraid this is a breaking change and can’t just go in a patch release, in SemVer terms.

| Thanks for this patch. Normally, I’d merge and release a security patch immediately but I’m reluctant to do so in this case for two reasons:   1. this is a breaking change and 2. it contains Rails-specific code   I’d propose that we solve this by creating a new gem: `omniauth-rails`, that depends on `omniauth` and `rails` and contains all Rails-specific code. We could release this as version 1.0.0 and notify users of OmniAuth that they should depend on `omniauth-rails` instead of `omniauth` if they’re using OmniAuth with Rails.  I’d like to get 👍 from the original author of OmniAuth ([@mbleigh](https://github.com/mbleigh)) before making this change as well as the Rails security team ([@tenderlove](https://github.com/tenderlove), [@jeremy](https://github.com/jeremy), [@NZKoz](https://github.com/NZKoz)).  If everyone agrees this is a good idea, we can move forward with this plan very quickly. |

[@DouweM](https://github.com/DouweM) I think it would be helpful to have a CVE-ID for this vulnerability, so we can reference it unambiguously. Since you are most familiar with this issue, could you please initiate that process? The process to request a CVE-ID is described [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html). |

| I guess I don't understand how this is a Rails specific issue. Any framework you use with Omniauth will have this problem if you're using GET requests (though this solution is for Rails apps). This patch seems fine for handling the Rails side (though I thought we'd do everything automatically if you did a `link_to` with a `method: post`) |

It seems good to me. The only question I have is since the link is turned in to a form, wouldn't we already take care of CSRF validation? I don't know omniauth internals. I assume it's a middleware? If Omiauth was placed after we do CSRF checking, couldn't we delete most of the code in this patch? |

OmniAuth intercepts the request at the Rack middleware level, before it gets to the Rails controller and the `protect_against_forgery` before\_action at all.  If Rails had a `RequestForgeryProtection` middleware, that would be useful here, but that wouldn't work for regular Rails controllers, since it depends on controller-level settings.  This patch basically turns `protect_against_forgery` into a middleware, albeit an OmniAuth-specific one, using the settings on `ApplicationController`. |

| [@sferik](https://github.com/sferik) So what's the next step? If you create an `intridea/omniauth-rails` repo, I'm happy to build a gem out of this patch and move it there. I think it's better to have it under `intridea` than `DouweM` or `gitlabhq`, so people will know it's the "official" OmniAuth+Rails gem. |

[@DouweM](https://github.com/DouweM) I just created an empty repo at <https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-rails>. I’ll initialize that with a gem scaffold now. Feel free to open a pull request against that repo with the same code you’ve placed here. I’ll be busy for the next few hours but will try to push out a release later on this evening.  The `README` of this repo should also be updated to indicate that Rails users should depend on `omniauth-rails` instead of directly on `omniauth`.  I’m going to close this pull request. |

| Hi all, is the gem below the recommended upgrade route for those of us using Rails? <https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection>  Hi, I found that README is updated recently. <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth#integrating-omniauth-into-your-application>  **Please note:** there is currently a CSRF vulnerability which affects OmniAuth (designated [CVE-2015-9284](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9284)) that requires mitigation at the application level. More details on how to do this can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).  In the wiki page, `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` is used as a first step for mitigating the vulnerability.  EDIT: [@DouweM](https://github.com/DouweM), update the OP with those information if you please.  BTW, depedabot may urge to update omniauth to 1.9.1, but I don't think the update don't include any fix for the vulnerability.  See [v1.9.0...v1.9.1](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1) Security related commits seem to be only this REAME change; [0740ac9](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/commit/0740ac90614228402952c20a6a3f6ece6c25c57d) |

| At this point, is there any reason we can't:   1. munge the learnings from `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` into this `omniauth` 2. add something like `raise 'this version is only compatible with rails, read [this wiki] for more info and submit a PR! :)' unless defined?(Rails)` somewhere 3. release 2.0 with notes about the breaking changes and how to fix `link_to` 4. wait for the non-rails patches for <insert your favorite framework> to come a rollin' on in?   This would solve the issue for (presumably) the majority of us, would be a step in the right direction since the rails solution is more or less figured out and would open the door to other frameworks to contribute an acceptable solution for them. There's already good work done above for sinatra and rack apps. They just need to be finalized.  I realize this isn't ideal, but it wouldn't outright break non-rails apps since the `raise` statement prevents them from upgrading and they 'work' today, so they'll 'work' tomorrow. It might even spur some benefit because it would force the non-rails community to think through what their solution is and get it in place.  We've had some time to let the dust settle, and now I fear that this lingering CVE is conditionalizing everyone to accept that "open CVEs for omniauth" are quite alright. |

| I'm trying to take this vulnerability seriously, but I just can't help but think how *difficult* it would be for an attacker to exploit it in the way described by the OP.   * the attacker would only be able to target victims that are using a browser session where the attacker is currently logged into a 3rd party service (e.g. Google), which drastically narrows down the victim pool * the victim would need to be logged into the particular application the attacker wants to hijack (e.g. GitLab.com) * the attacker would need to feed the victim a link to the `/auth/:provider` page and get them to click on it * when the 3rd party redirects back, and the app links attacker's 3rd party to victim's primary account, the app would probably show a message such as "Your Google account has been successfully linked to your primary account", which the victim would have to ignore and not try to unlink it or anything (remember, they didn't intend to sign into GitLab.com or even visit it in the first place, they clicked on a disguised link)   Is there an angle that I'm missing? Or is the main pain of this vulnerability the fact that it has a CVE assigned that is causing noise?  I'm currently building OmniAuth integation for Rodauth, and I thought I should go ahead and disallow `GET /auth/:provider`. But from reading a bit, requiring `POST` appears to have its own issues as well, such as being incompatible with authentication flows where something redirects to `/auth/:provider` (which multiple people mentioned here), and not supporting `env["omniauth.params"]` out of the box ([#975](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/975)). |

| I want to say the fact that we don't persist query params from the callback phase isn't due to the POST method, but the fact that we set the `omniauth.params` to try and delete the [same key from the session](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/blob/master/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L236) which I think has to do with the fact that [callback urls contain sensitive information](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/). If you really wanted to access the callback query params I *believe* they should always be accessible on a `Rack::Request.new(@env).GET` since as far as I can tell the [GET](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/d3225f7c201320ed272a2fa7b000c5850e4a5f88/lib/rack/request.rb#L426-L434) and [POST](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/d3225f7c201320ed272a2fa7b000c5850e4a5f88/lib/rack/request.rb#L440-L463) methods are available on a Rack::Request regardless of the fact that the HTTP\_METHOD was POST. You could do this in a `before_callback_phase` block ~pseudo:  ``` OmniAuth.config.before_callback_phase = ->(env) { env['rack.session']['my.params'] =  Rack::Request.new(env).GET.slice("keys", "you", "want") } ``` |

| [@BobbyMcWho](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho) `omniauth.params` isn't for retrieving callback phase parameters, but *request* phase parameters. Supporting POST parameters should be as easy as using `request.params` instead of `request.GET` on [this line](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/blob/c95a5a0a50e012b3ba34401a19d589fcdf02afdf/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L208). |

| For the use-case where I have my own controller actions that do work before redirecting to /auth, is there a way to simply "call" the request phase manually from my controller? (vs redirecting).. Then I don't even need the /auth/:provider routes at all. ...  If this is a specific question about the PR I posted, please ask it on the PR [#1010](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/1010) itself. If this is a general OmniAuth question, please refrain from asking in this thread since there are so many people subscribed to it.

Subject: CVE Request: CSRF vulnerability in OmniAuth request phase

Affected software:
- Ruby gem (library) OmniAuth[0]
- Gems that use OmniAuth, e.g. Devise[1]

Type of vulnerability:
Cross-Site Request Forgery

Original report by:
Mohamed Abdelbaset Elnoby, Senior Information Security Analyst at Seekurity.com[2]
[The website Seekurity.com isn’t currently working.]

Summary:

OmniAuth is a library used in Ruby web applications to authenticate users using
external services, for example OAuth providers.

The request phase of OmniAuth is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This
is the step that actually connects an external account (on a connected OAuth
provider) to an internal account (on the web application itself). This means
that when a client is signed into an account on the web application, and signed
into an account on a connected OAuth provider, these two accounts can be
connected without user intent, user interaction or feedback to the user. From
here on out, the external account can be used to sign into the web application
as the internal account.

If the sign in action at a connected OAuth provider is vulnerable to CSRF, an
attacker can force the victim’s client to be logged into the external service
using an account beloning to the attacker, can then force this external account
to be connected to the internal account, and can from here on out use their
account on the external service to log into the victim’s account on the targeted
application.

We are aware of one large OAuth provider where the sign in action is or was
vulnerable to CSRF.

### @DouweM **[DouweM](/DouweM)** commented [May 25, 2015](#issue-80451277) • edited Loading

TL;DR, as of 2020-03-07:

> Please note: there is currently a CSRF vulnerability which affects OmniAuth (designated [CVE-2015-9284](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9284)) that requires mitigation at the application level. More details on how to do this can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).

Original issue description:

---

The request phase in OmniAuth is currently vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery, which allows an attacker to easily gain full access to a user's account on a site that uses OmniAuth, when used in combination with another CSRF vulnerability on the side of a connected OAuth provider.

This vulnerability was reported to us (GitLab) by Mohamed Abdelbaset Elnoby ([@SymbianSyMoh](https://github.com/SymbianSyMoh)), a Senior Information Security Analyst at [Seekurity.com](http://seekurity.com), on April 23rd. On April 24th, we reported it to the OmniAuth team via email. On May 14th, we [merged our patch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/c2ee828c19cb245809647428334b8ef215536a0d) into the public GitLab repository.

Mr. Elnoby also gave us an example of an OAuth provider that had the CSRF vulnerability on their side that is needed to make this attack "weaponizable". The vulnerability has been reported to them.

The below description of the issue is written from GitLab’s perspective.

> Connecting the GitLab account to an OAuth provider like Google works like this:
>
> 1. User visits <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google>
> 2. User is redirected to a page on Google
> 3. Google checks if the user is logged in
> 4. If the user is logged in, Google checks if the user has authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account
> 5. If the user has authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account, Google redirects back to GitLab
> 6. GitLab adds the Google account to the GitLab account as an alternate identity, which means the Google account can be used to log into the GitLab account.
>
> This is all very straightforward, and works as expected.
>
> Note that if the Google user has already authorized the GitLab.com application to use their Google account, there is no user action needed to link the two accounts, apart from the initial <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google> visit.
>
> This means that if you can get a person who 1) is signed into Google, 2) has authorized the GitLab.com application to use it, and 3) is signed into GitLab.com, to visit <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/google>, their account will be linked to the Google account without any further interaction, and without any feedback to the user.
>
> This is not a big deal if the signed in Google account belongs to the GitLab user themselves, but it is if the user is somehow signed into Google using an account belonging to an attacker. In this scenario, the GitLab account would be linked to the attacker's Google account, and the GitLab user would be none the wiser.
>
> And let it just so be the case that that iss possible with *Redacted*: there exists a vulnerability on their side that allows an attacker to log into *Redacted* using CSRF, which means that if a user visits a specially crafted page, they will end up being logged into *Redacted* as the attacker.
>
> Combining this with the described GitLab.com flow, forcing the victim to visit that specially crafted page, and directly after that, forcing them to visit <https://gitlab.com/users/auth/redacted> (by using an iframe, for example), will give the attacker full control over the victim's GitLab account. "Forcing them" can be as simple as sending them a link over email and getting them to click it.

To actually use the POST method rather than GET so the CSRF token is sent along, we have changed our links to the auth path from:

```
link_to "Log in with #{provider}", omniauth_authorize_path(:user, provider)
```

to:

```
link_to "Log in with #{provider}", omniauth_authorize_path(:user, provider), method: :post
```

Note that the current implementation is very specific to Rails. It needs to be, as far as I can see, since the CSRF protection needs to use the web framework’s authenticity token.

I suggest deprecating `OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods` and only allowing `:post` from now on, but I haven't made that change yet since I think it warrants more discussion.

People that use OmniAuth with Rails will need to change the `link_to` helpers and `<form>` tags in their own code to use `POST` instead of `GET`,

so I’m afraid this is a breaking change and can’t just go in a patch release, in SemVer terms.

| Thanks for this patch. Normally, I’d merge and release a security patch immediately but I’m reluctant to do so in this case for two reasons:   1. this is a breaking change and 2. it contains Rails-specific code   I’d propose that we solve this by creating a new gem: `omniauth-rails`, that depends on `omniauth` and `rails` and contains all Rails-specific code. We could release this as version 1.0.0 and notify users of OmniAuth that they should depend on `omniauth-rails` instead of `omniauth` if they’re using OmniAuth with Rails.  I’d like to get 👍 from the original author of OmniAuth ([@mbleigh](https://github.com/mbleigh)) before making this change as well as the Rails security team ([@tenderlove](https://github.com/tenderlove), [@jeremy](https://github.com/jeremy), [@NZKoz](https://github.com/NZKoz)).  If everyone agrees this is a good idea, we can move forward with this plan very quickly. |

[@DouweM](https://github.com/DouweM) I think it would be helpful to have a CVE-ID for this vulnerability, so we can reference it unambiguously. Since you are most familiar with this issue, could you please initiate that process? The process to request a CVE-ID is described [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html). |

| I guess I don't understand how this is a Rails specific issue. Any framework you use with Omniauth will have this problem if you're using GET requests (though this solution is for Rails apps). This patch seems fine for handling the Rails side (though I thought we'd do everything automatically if you did a `link_to` with a `method: post`) |

It seems good to me. The only question I have is since the link is turned in to a form, wouldn't we already take care of CSRF validation? I don't know omniauth internals. I assume it's a middleware? If Omiauth was placed after we do CSRF checking, couldn't we delete most of the code in this patch? |

OmniAuth intercepts the request at the Rack middleware level, before it gets to the Rails controller and the `protect_against_forgery` before\_action at all.  If Rails had a `RequestForgeryProtection` middleware, that would be useful here, but that wouldn't work for regular Rails controllers, since it depends on controller-level settings.  This patch basically turns `protect_against_forgery` into a middleware, albeit an OmniAuth-specific one, using the settings on `ApplicationController`. |

| [@sferik](https://github.com/sferik) So what's the next step? If you create an `intridea/omniauth-rails` repo, I'm happy to build a gem out of this patch and move it there. I think it's better to have it under `intridea` than `DouweM` or `gitlabhq`, so people will know it's the "official" OmniAuth+Rails gem. |

Feel free to open a pull request against that repo with the same code you’ve placed here. I’ll be busy for the next few hours but will try to push out a release later on this evening.  The `README` of this repo should also be updated to indicate that Rails users should depend on `omniauth-rails` instead of directly on `omniauth`.  I’m going to close this pull request. |

| Hi all, is the gem below the recommended upgrade route for those of us using Rails? <https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection>  Hi, I found that README is updated recently. <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth#integrating-omniauth-into-your-application>  **Please note:** there is currently a CSRF vulnerability which affects OmniAuth (designated [CVE-2015-9284](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9284)) that requires mitigation at the application level. More details on how to do this can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).  In the wiki page, `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` is used as a first step for mitigating the vulnerability.  EDIT: [@DouweM](https://github.com/DouweM), update the OP with those information if you please.  BTW, depedabot may urge to update omniauth to 1.9.1, but I don't think the update don't include any fix for the vulnerability.  See [v1.9.0...v1.9.1](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1) Security related commits seem to be only this REAME change; [0740ac9](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/commit/0740ac90614228402952c20a6a3f6ece6c25c57d) |

| At this point, is there any reason we can't:   1. munge the learnings from `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` into this `omniauth` 2. add something like `raise 'this version is only compatible with rails, read [this wiki] for more info and submit a PR! :)' unless defined?(Rails)` somewhere 3. release 2.0 with notes about the breaking changes and how to fix `link_to` 4. wait for the non-rails patches for <insert your favorite framework> to come a rollin' on in?   This would solve the issue for (presumably) the majority of us, would be a step in the right direction since the rails solution is more or less figured out and would open the door to other frameworks to contribute an acceptable solution for them. There's already good work done above for sinatra and rack apps. They just need to be finalized.  I realize this isn't ideal, but it wouldn't outright break non-rails apps since the `raise` statement prevents them from upgrading and they 'work' today, so they'll 'work' tomorrow. It might even spur some benefit because it would force the non-rails community to think through what their solution is and get it in place.  We've had some time to let the dust settle, and now I fear that this lingering CVE is conditionalizing everyone to accept that "open CVEs for omniauth" are quite alright. |

| I'm trying to take this vulnerability seriously, but I just can't help but think how *difficult* it would be for an attacker to exploit it in the way described by the OP.   * the attacker would only be able to target victims that are using a browser session where the attacker is currently logged into a 3rd party service (e.g. Google), which drastically narrows down the victim pool * the victim would need to be logged into the particular application the attacker wants to hijack (e.g. GitLab.com) * the attacker would need to feed the victim a link to the `/auth/:provider` page and get them to click on it * when the 3rd party redirects back, and the app links attacker's 3rd party to victim's primary account, the app would probably show a message such as "Your Google account has been successfully linked to your primary account", which the victim would have to ignore and not try to unlink it or anything (remember, they didn't intend to sign into GitLab.com or even visit it in the first place, they clicked on a disguised link)   Is there an angle that I'm missing? Or is the main pain of this vulnerability the fact that it has a CVE assigned that is causing noise?  I'm currently building OmniAuth integation for Rodauth, and I thought I should go ahead and disallow `GET /auth/:provider`. But from reading a bit, requiring `POST` appears to have its own issues as well, such as being incompatible with authentication flows where something redirects to `/auth/:provider` (which multiple people mentioned here), and not supporting `env["omniauth.params"]` out of the box ([#975](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/975)). |

| I want to say the fact that we don't persist query params from the callback phase isn't due to the POST method, but the fact that we set the `omniauth.params` to try and delete the [same key from the session](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/blob/master/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L236) which I think has to do with the fact that [callback urls contain sensitive information](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/). If you really wanted to access the callback query params I *believe* they should always be accessible on a `Rack::Request.new(@env).GET` since as far as I can tell the [GET](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/d3225f7c201320ed272a2fa7b000c5850e4a5f88/lib/rack/request.rb#L426-L434) and [POST](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/d3225f7c201320ed272a2fa7b000c5850e4a5f88/lib/rack/request.rb#L440-L463) methods are available on a Rack::Request regardless of the fact that the HTTP\_METHOD was POST. You could do this in a `before_callback_phase` block ~pseudo:  ``` OmniAuth.config.before_callback_phase = ->(env) { env['rack.session']['my.params'] =  Rack::Request.new(env).GET.slice("keys", "you", "want") } ``` |

| [@BobbyMcWho](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho) `omniauth.params` isn't for retrieving callback phase parameters, but *request* phase parameters. Supporting POST parameters should be as easy as using `request.params` instead of `request.GET` on [this line](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/blob/c95a5a0a50e012b3ba34401a19d589fcdf02afdf/lib/omniauth/strategy.rb#L208). |

| For the use-case where I have my own controller actions that do work before redirecting to /auth, is there a way to simply "call" the request phase manually from my controller? (vs redirecting).. Then I don't even need the /auth/:provider routes at all. ...  If this is a specific question about the PR I posted, please ask it on the PR [#1010](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/1010) itself. If this is a general OmniAuth question, please refrain from asking in this thread since there are so many people subscribed to it.

## OmniAuth Ruby gem Cross-site Request Forgery in request phase

High severity

GitHub Reviewed

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-ww4x-rwq6-qpgf)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-ww4x-rwq6-qpgf/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

omniauth
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 1.9.2

## Patched versions

2.0.0

## Description

The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem (1.9.2 and earlier) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing accounts to be connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback to the user. This permits a secondary account to be able to sign into the web application as the primary account.

As of v2 OmniAuth no longer has the vulnerable configuration by default, but it is still possible to configure OmniAuth in such a way that the web application becomes vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. There is a recommended remediation described [here](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

Re:

[#960](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/960)

[#809](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809)

Shoutout [@pat](https://github.com/pat), this work was influenced by [#963](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/963)

This would obviously need to be a major version bump due to breaking changes.

This is based on the ideas of a few others, with some things I added in myself.

The changes include:

* Defaulting to POST only allowed request methods
* Use of a `request_validation_phase` specific to this type of workflow.
* Default request validation phase that should work for *most* rack based apps, though Rails is a special case

Example apps available [here](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho/omniauth_2_examples).

Rails apps will require a special [verification phase](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho/omniauth_2_examples/blob/main/rails_app.ru#L14-L28) that they [config](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho/omniauth_2_examples/blob/main/rails_app.ru#L34) in an initializer (or elsewhere if using devise).

Seeking feedback and reviews, hoping I didn't miss anything glaringly obvious here.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Love the progress and direction!  Why not stick the rails specific configuration in a railtie so apps don't have to do anything?  I'm not particularly fond of including Rails specific code in libraries, I know that is also a position held by past maintainers of this project as well.  If rails changes the internals of the protect\_from\_request\_forgery classes, that means that omniauth is now required to update and write version-specific implementations.  I'd much rather leave it to the application owners to configure, or have the frequently used [cookpad/omniauth-rails\_csrf\_protection](https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection) updated post release of OmniAuth 2.0 to configure it. |

Hmm, I see what you're saying, however it will only log in the case that `OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods.include?(:get)` resolves to true. (See line 198)

Yeah, correct. During the upgrade process, we wanted to track down any potential cases where `GET` is used instead of the legit `POST`. We relied on the <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Upgrading-to-2.0#get> that says

> Because using GET for login poses concerns (see OWASP Cheatsheet), after upgrading OmniAuth will log a :warn level log with **every GET request to a login path** when your OmniAuth.config.allowed\_request\_methods include :get.

Instead, we've uncovered that the warning is produced to any GET request to our app and the log stream is getting bloated pretty fast.

Should the `warn_if_using_get` be guarded with `on_auth_path?` check? We can work on the PR if you confirm.

I think that would be a reasonable resolution, yes. A PR would be appreciated and I'll hopefully have some time soon to go through the release w/ a patch bump for you.

| HI!  Something I was not able to find anywhere is any comments on whether enforcing POST for request phase implies that Single Sign On aka SSO would be affected:  As far as I understand, switching to POST only does make sense if the request phase form submission itself is explicit and imposed to user – it would not make sense to have some JS that submits the form automatically.  Imagine a situation where single auth provider is being used by ecosystem of apps – let's say each of these apps is a tab in a navigation bar of a portal. Switching between apps is currently seamless with GET request phase. |

Previously any request to `/users/<id>` would trigger a log in flow if you're not logged in. In https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/1010 (or somewhere around there) omniauth removed the ability to use a GET request to log in at all. Now all login requests must be done via GET.

This means you cannot redirect to a login endpoint, you must drop the user off somewhere there is a form and they must manually click it to trigger a POST.

That's what this PR does. If you try to edit or view your user account without being logged in today: it will give you a 404 error page with a cryptic error message.

(Which I think omniauth could improve A LOT, FWIW).

Anywhoo, to move forward I'm replacing the prior `authenticate_user!` before filter with one that checks if the request is a post. If it is, then it will directly authenticate the user. Otherwise we drop them on a \"soft\" page that tells them they must first login.

`[Soft landing for non-post omniauth requests](/codetriage/CodeTriage/commit/683ba049c8b8ead05020af633ee41c6981acc629 "Soft landing for non-post omniauth requests

Previously any request to `/users/<id>` would trigger a log in flow if you're not logged in. In https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/1010 (or somewhere around there) omniauth removed the ability to use a GET request to log in at all. Now all login requests must be done via GET.

This means you cannot redirect to a login endpoint, you must drop the user off somewhere there is a form and they must manually click it to trigger a POST.

That's what this PR does. If you try to edit or view your user account without being logged in today: it will give you a 404 error page with a cryptic error message.

```
Not found. Authentication passthru.
```

(Which I think omniauth could improve A LOT, FWIW).

Anywhoo, to move forward I'm replacing the prior `authenticate_user!` before filter with one that checks if the request is a post. If it is, then it will directly authenticate the user. Otherwise we drop them on a \"soft\" page that tells them they must first login.

It's not perfect, I'm sure there will be edge cases, but it works.")`

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

[16 revisions](/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284/_history)

These instructions are up-to-date as of **August 12th, 2019**, and **OmniAuth version v1.9.0**. They are written to address [CVE-2015-9284](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9284), and are consolidated from discussions in [#809](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809).

## Using GET requests

A key part of resolving this vulnerability is refusing GET requests to `/auth/:provider` endpoints.

If the use of GET requests to `/auth/:provider` is essential for your application (for example, if you are ever redirecting to `/auth/:provider` as part of an authentication process), then you will need to put together a more involved solution for your specific needs. This may mean redirecting to a standard log-in screen which includes `link_to 'Log in', '/auth/:provider', method: :post` or another POST/form-based approach (like `button_to`).

## Mitigating in Rails applications

1. Add Rails' inbuilt CSRF protection to the POST requests by using the `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` gem:

```
# Gemfile
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
```

2. Update all links to `/auth/:provider` to use POST requests. For example:

```
link_to 'Sign in via X', '/auth/:provider', method: :post
# or
button_to 'Sign in via X', '/auth/:provider'
```

Not doing this will permit GET requests and cause the passthru to third-parties to fail, giving this Devise error message: ["Not found. Authentication passthru."](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/master/app/controllers/devise/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb#L6)

3. If you're using `bundler-audit`, you will need to explicitly ignore the CVE:

```
bundle audit check --ignore CVE-2015-9284
```

4. If you *are* continuing to use GET requests to access `/auth/:provider` then you will need to explicitly enable it, as `omniauth-rails_csrf_protection` modifies the default to be POST-only (but remember that using GET requests for `/auth/:provider` is not recommended and you should try to stick to POST requests if at all possible):

```
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb or similar
OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods = [:post, :get]
```

## Mitigating in non-Rails applications

1. Add CSRF protection to OmniAuth POST requests with the `rack-protection` gem, using an approach similar to that which @abrom has put together: <https://gist.github.com/abrom/effe58b27a4f4ac1b97fb85593d7c3be>.
2. Provided you do not need GET access to `/auth/:provider`, you should ensure only POST requests are allowed:

```
# config/initializers/omniauth.rb or similar
OmniAuth.config.allowed_request_methods = [:post]
```

3. Update all links to `/auth/:provider` to use POST requests. You will need to craft forms that POST to `/auth/:provider`, and have a hidden field with the value of the session's CSRF token. The `rack-protection` source code has a good example: <https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/eee711bce740d38a9a91aa6028688c9a6d74b23b/rack-protection/lib/rack/protection/authenticity_token.rb#L63>
4. If you're using `bundler-audit`, you will need to explicitly ignore the CVE:

```
bundle audit check --ignore CVE-2015-9284
```

## Regression Testing

Should you wish to add regression testing to validate that this vulnerability is mitigated then you can consult the following examples:

* [RSpec Example](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/pull/809#issuecomment-512689882)
* [Minitest Example - Omniauth 1.9.x](https://gist.github.com/CHTJonas/70cd9ec5fcffa6ca5bae0e04ec51d174)
* [Minitest Example - Omniauth 2.x](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/issues/1031#issuecomment-788950083)

tu arrives a acceder a la super admin en local ? je n'y arrive pas moi je tombe sur une page disant "auth pass thru"

aussi, sur <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284> je lis :

> A key part of resolving this vulnerability is refusing GET requests to /auth/:provider endpoints.

Or les routes n'ont pas changé entre ta PR et master :

```
➜  rdv-solidarites.fr git:(CVE-2015-9284) rails routes | grep auth | grep provider
                                               GET      /api/v1/auth/:provider/callback(.:format)                                                devise_token_auth/omniauth_callbacks#omniauth_success
                                               GET|POST /omniauth/:provider/callback(.:format)                                                   devise_token_auth/omniauth_callbacks#redirect_callbacks
                                               GET      /api/v1/auth/:provider(.:format)                                                         redirect(301)

```

il y a un GET sur `/api/v1/auth/:provider` qui redirige.

par ex `` a l'air de rediriger vers `omniauth/github?namespace_name=api_v1&resource_class=AgentWithTokenAuth` et cette page fait une 404

Je dois dire que je suis hyper perplexe sur cette faille ! je ne comprends pas comment on pouvait y être vulnérable avant si on avait déjà pas de GET requests.

merci beaucoup d'avoir pris le temps d'investiguer et d'ajouter une spec qui a l'air de s'assurer qu'on a corrigé le pb. si tu es confiant, et que ça ne casse pas l'accès à la super admin ça me va

| Merci d'avoir poussé le test, j'avais oublié de me déconnecté du super admin. En le faisant, je n'ai pas pu me reconnecter. Le truc c'est sans doute de passer par une page spécial pour pouvoir faire un post ensuite vers Github si j'ai bien saisi... Je la repasse en draft |

| Ça semble mieux fonctionner.  Je n'ai pas été très inspiré :   * la route : `/connexion_super_admin` * dans le `welcome_controller` * et dans la vue, un simple lien en post.   Ensuite, est-ce qu'on fait confiance à ce fix ? Je ne sais pas. Pour être sur, il faudrait prendre le temps de reproduire l'attaque, vérifier que nous étions vulnérable avant l'ajout de cette gem et du lien en post, puis, vérifier une fois la PR déployé... |

👍 on va dire que la nouvelle page `/connexion_super_admins` rajoute un peu de securité par obfuscation :)
