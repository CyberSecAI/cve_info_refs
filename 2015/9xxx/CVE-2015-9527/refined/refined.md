Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) without properly escaping the URL passed as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Unescaped URL:**  The core issue is the inclusion of an unescaped or untrusted URL as a parameter to  `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`. These functions are used to modify URLs by adding or removing query parameters. When a user-controlled or untrusted URL is passed as the third parameter without proper sanitization, it introduces a vulnerability.
* **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious code into this parameter, potentially leading to a variety of attacks by manipulating the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Redirect to Malicious Sites:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL and inject it into the vulnerable parameter, causing a user to be redirected to a harmful website.
* **Phishing:** Users could be redirected to a fake login page or other phishing site, leading to credential compromise.
* **Other malicious activity:** Depending on the manipulated URL, the attacker could perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **URL Parameter Injection:**  The primary attack vector is through manipulating URL parameters where the vulnerable `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions are being used without sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Ability to manipulate URL parameters:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the URL parameters processed by the vulnerable functions.
* **No specific user access is needed** as the attack is primarily through URL manipulation.

**Additional Notes**
* The blog post indicates that not *all* instances of  `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`  are vulnerable. The vulnerability is triggered specifically when an unescaped/untrusted URL is used as the third parameter.
* The security fix was automatically deployed for those who had automatic updates enabled.
