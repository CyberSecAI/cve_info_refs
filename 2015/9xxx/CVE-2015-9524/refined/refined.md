Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress without proper sanitization of the URL passed as the third parameter. Specifically, if the third parameter contains an unescaped or untrusted URL, it can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core vulnerability is the potential for a malicious user to inject arbitrary URLs into the query parameters of a link. This is caused by not properly sanitizing the third argument of the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Open Redirect:** An attacker could manipulate the URL to redirect users to a malicious website. This could be used for phishing attacks or to trick users into visiting sites that install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that are passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions with an unescaped or untrusted URL as the third parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to influence the third parameter of the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions, typically by injecting a malicious URL through user-controlled input or by somehow manipulating the URL generation logic.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is not present in every use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`, only when the third parameter is an unsanitized URL.
- The fix was deployed automatically, but users who have disabled automatic updates might be affected.
