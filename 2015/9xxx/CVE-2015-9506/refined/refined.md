The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads (EDD). It does not provide the CVE number but based on the date of the blog post (April 20, 2015), it is likely related to CVE-2015-9506.
Here's what can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress where the third parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Unescaped URLs passed to `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()`.
-  Lack of proper sanitization and validation of URLs before they are used in query parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The blog post doesn't explicitly specify the impact but based on the function names being related to URL parameters and comments from users in the blog indicate it would be an open redirect vulnerability.
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when processed by the vulnerable code, redirects a user to an arbitrary external site. This can be used in phishing campaigns or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing a crafted redirect URL to exploit this vulnerability.
- This crafted URL would have to be processed by the vulnerable Easy Digital Downloads plugin that is running on a WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker can then get a victim to click on that crafted URL
