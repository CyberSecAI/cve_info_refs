I love the idea of this plugin, and have been building some other PWA stuff – I was using this on a fairly big site, bought the pro version for $250 or around there, and have a couple issues, and have contacted them 4 or 5 times with no response. Super cool when it works, but a few small but important issues (like code showing up in headlines and no search feature…really?) went unanswered so I uninstalled and now consider it a waste of money. Too bad…PWAs are the stuff of the future and I love the way this works, but I’m seriously disappointed in the lack of company response to my issues.
I give the two stars for the design and basic function, but -3 for the support. If they got these couple small issues ironed out I would reinstall and give 5-stars easily…but they must have bigger fish to fry.

I came across this plugin when I needed a solution to my problem (I needed a site that could work on pc and mobile seamlessly). With a few tweaks here and there, it beautifully solves the hassle of having a mobile site, providing awesome themes for every need.
\*Awesome support included.

Developer never contacted us, so much for Pro support,
Still have multiple pages not working.
Avoid this plugin
Was finally contacted by developer and PRO is now loaded…
There are still minor issues with pages but expecting the developer to contact us shortly to sort this out

Subject: CVE Request - Information Exposure Vulnerability in WordPress Mobile
 Pack Wordpress Plugin v2.1.2 (and certain versions of v2.1.3 - prior to June
 3, 2015)

Hi,

I discovered Information Exposure Vulnerability in WordPress Mobile Pack
Wordpress Plugin v2.1.2 which was responsibly disclosed to the vendor who
fixed the issues in v2.1.3. The vulnerability is also present in certain
versions of v2.1.3 (prior to June 3, 2015), hence users who have those
versions also need to upgrade/reinstall.

I request a CVE for the same.

References:

Thanks & regards,
Nitin Venkatesh
