Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9269:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `content.php` file within the WordPress Mobile Pack plugin. This file was designed to export article content in JSON format. However, it did not properly check the publication status of posts before exporting them, resulting in the exposure of private posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The plugin allows unauthorized access to private post content by returning it in JSON format through the `content.php` endpoint. This bypasses the intended visibility restrictions of WordPress.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to the content of private posts which could include sensitive information that the site owner intended to keep confidential.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `content.php` file, including the `content=exportarticle`, `callback=exportarticle`, and the `articleId` parameters of a private post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication and can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the `articleId` of a private post.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects WordPress Mobile Pack plugin versions 2.1.2 and below, as well as certain versions of 2.1.3 installed before June 3, 2015.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.1.3. Users who had the vulnerable version of 2.1.3 were advised to re-download and re-install the plugin.
- The vulnerable endpoint was located at `/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/export/content.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter was `articleId`.
- The response includes the title, timestamp, author, content, and other related data of a private post in a JSON format.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nitin Venkatesh.
