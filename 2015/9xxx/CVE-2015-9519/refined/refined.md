Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability addressed:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Specifically, these functions were vulnerable when the third parameter (a URL) was an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unescaped URL parameters:** The core issue is that when `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` is used with user-supplied or otherwise untrusted URLs without proper sanitization, it introduces a vulnerability. 
- The code lacked proper sanitization of the URL passed as the 3rd parameter in `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious code or redirect users to malicious websites via crafted URLs. This is a classic example of an open redirect vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers could craft malicious URLs, exploiting the lack of sanitization when `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` is called.
- This could be achieved by injecting malicious URLs through various means (e.g. comment fields, custom links, etc.) that are then processed by the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject or manipulate URL parameters.
- The attacker doesn't need special access; they just need a point of interaction with the website that involves the generation or modification of URLs, for example by providing a URL in a comment or by some other mechanism.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability is not present in every instance of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg`. It specifically occurs when the third parameter, an URL, is not properly escaped.
- The fix was automatically deployed which was mentioned in a comment by Pippin Williamson.
- The comments also show that at least one user was aware of a potential unescaped parameter and asking for clarification.
