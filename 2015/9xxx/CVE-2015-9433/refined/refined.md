Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Social Bookmarking Light plugin (version 1.7.9) is vulnerable to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of CSRF protection on settings update form.
- Insecure handling of user input in multiple parameters of the plugin's settings page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the WordPress admin panel, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking: stealing administrator cookies and gaining control over the site.
  - Malicious redirects: redirecting administrators to phishing pages or malware download sites.
  - Defacement: modifying the site's appearance or content.
  - Data theft: stealing sensitive data from the WordPress backend.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is conducted through an HTTP POST request to the plugin's settings page (`wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-social-bookmarking-light%2Fmodules%2Fadmin.php`).
- Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable: `services`, `styles`, `mixi[check_key]`, `mixi[check_robots]`, `mixi_like[width]`, `twitter[via]`, `facebook[locale]`, `facebook_like[width]`, `facebook_share[width]`, `facebook_send[width]`, `facebook_send[height]`, `tumblr[button_type]`, `atode[button_type]`, `google_plus_one[inline_size]`, `line[button_type]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress administrator to access the plugin's settings page.
- No CSRF protection is present so the administrator must be tricked into submitting the form.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept HTML form to exploit the vulnerability.
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin repository due to security issues.
