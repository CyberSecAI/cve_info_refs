## Description

This plugin allows you to quickly create child themes from any theme that you have currently installed on your site/blog.

It also creates rtl.css if exists in the parent theme.

**Did you find this plugin helpful? Please consider [writing a review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/orbisius-child-theme-creator)**

\*\* [Live Demo](https://wpdemo.net/demos/plugins/orbisius-child-theme-creator)\*\*

#### Child Theme Creator Features

* Since v1.4 store your snippets, license keys in Orbisius cloud library. Access them with a click of a button.
* Create a theme with a click of a button
* Uses the recommended approach for loading css (since v.1.3.4)
* Never forget what files to copy and what to skip when creating child themes.
* Copies parent theme’s options (since v.1.3)
* Easy to use interface
* When moving through the themes the currently looked one will have a nice background & border
* Create *unlimited* child themes from a parent theme. The plugin will add Child 01, Child 02 etc.
* Edit theme files with our two theme editors.
* Automatically creates rtl.css if it exists in the parent theme
* The plugin uses minified css/js to make sure it loads quicker.
* Copy files from one theme to another (Since v1.5.2)

This plugin allows you to quickly edit theme files from Appearance > Orbisius Theme Editor (entry added by the same plugin)

It features two editors and you can pick snippets from one theme and paste into another.

#### Theme Editor Features

* Edit two theme files at the same time
* Ajax -> No page refresh
* Easy to use interface
* Supports WordPress Multisite
* Create a New File (+ checks if the file exists)
* Delete file
* Respects the DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT constant, which if set to true will disable the Theme editor
* Since (v1.1.3) PHP syntax check
* Since (v1.1.3) Send selected theme and parent theme (if any) to yourself or a colleague.
* Since (v1.1.3) Implemented theme files to be listed recursively (i.e. all files from the selected theme)
* Since (v1.1.9) Both editors have the same buttons (in older versions only the left editor had all of the buttons).
* Since (v1.2.2) Can create a blank functions.php file (Thanks Tobias Kaupat for the suggestion)
* Since (v1.3.5)\* Users can create new files in non-existing folders e.g. headers/header-two.php

#### Important Reasons to Create Child Themes

* Keep your changes when the parent theme is updated.
* Reduce duplicated code i.e. you need to copy and customize only the files that need to be customized
* Child Themes are often very small in size and can easily be shared and used for another project.
* Lots of cool and professional people do it
* … and a lot more

## Installation

1. Unzip the package, and upload `orbisius-child-theme-creator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

## FAQ

### How to change Child thme screenshot?

currently, only via ftp.

### How to use this plugin?

Just install the plugin and activate it. Then go to Admin > Appearance > Orbisius Child Theme Creator.

Then click on a theme and the plugin will create a child theme for you.

### After my child theme is created can I remove the plugin safely?

Yes, you can, however, the plugin comes with a double editor which is pretty awesome.

It allows you to copy and paste from one theme to another without changing screens.

### How to disable Orbisius Theme Editor Plugin?

Just put this line right after the first <?php tag in the wp-config.php. This will also remove the WordPress’ Theme/Plugin editors as well.

define(‘DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT’, true);

### How to edit a logo or colours?

The theme should have an option to do that.

Please, check the customizer or within the admin area for a menu that matches the theme’s name.

Our plugin doesn’t know how each theme works so it’s better to direct those kind of questions to the theme designer.

### The child theme is created but doesn’t have some styles or doesn’t show the admin panel of the parent theme

OK. Please contact the theme author if his/her theme is child theme friendly.

Also which files does the theme need in order to work well.

### My Site is Broken

!@$@!$. Ok. Calm down. When you created the theme did you click on copy functions.php from advanced options?

Ok. You’ll need to use FTP client and go to in the wordpress folder and then wp-content/themes/AAAAA-child-01/ and delete functions.php

AAAAA is of course the directory of your parent theme.

### I want to be able to copy functions.php

Please use Orbisius Theme Editor (part of this plugin)

### Troubleshooting

If your site becomes broken due to a child theme (mis)configuration. Please check another plugin of ours:

I’ve tried only a couple of child theme creator plug-ins because I’m running on Local by Flywheel and the others wigged out. This one not only installed and ran, but gave me some super-nice editing options. Very impressive.
