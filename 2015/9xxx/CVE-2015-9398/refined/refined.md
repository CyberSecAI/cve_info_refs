The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the GoCodes WordPress plugin version 1.3.5.

**1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `deletegc` parameter in the `tools.php` page is vulnerable to XSS due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code, leading to potential actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with an XSS payload in the `deletegc` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs an authenticated user (e.g., an editor) to click on the malicious URL. The lack of CSRF protection could potentially allow an attacker to force the vulnerable action on an authenticated user.

**2. Blind SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `gcid` parameter in the `tools.php` page is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** Unsafe usage of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. This can lead to complete database compromise including unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and potential privilege escalation.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection payloads in the `gcid` parameter.
*  **Required Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs an authenticated user (e.g., an editor) to send the malicious request. The lack of CSRF protection could potentially allow an attacker to force the vulnerable action on an authenticated user. The report also notes other SQL injection vulnerabilities with the same parameter in `/gocodes/menus.php:63` and `/gocodes/menus.php:158`
