### [Works Great, But‚Ä¶](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-but-35/)

I just wanted a nice, simple plug-in to make a page on my blog with my Flickr Photostream, in a nice layout and with the titles. This plugin meets my needs quite well, was easy to set up, and works great. Unfortunately, it appears to be abandoned, so alas, I will have to find a replacement at some point. üôÅ

This plugin has been running flawlessly on a client site since 2013, with no problems what so ever. Works fine even with WordPress 5.1.1. Thanks!

Normaly i would rate 5 Stars because its really easy, but as there is no button and i need to copy it from the settings page all over again the code, i can not give 5 Stars at all.
