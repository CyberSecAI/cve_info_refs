- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LAME encoder crashes when processing a crafted WAV file with a very large or negative sample rate, due to a missing check for invalid sample rate in the input. Additionally, a crash occurs when the ratio between input and output sample rates is very close to an integer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow during resampling calculation due to invalid sample rate in the input, leading to a segmentation fault. Missing validation of the number of input channels.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A specially crafted WAV file can cause LAME to crash (segmentation fault), potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Processing a malformed WAV file with the LAME encoder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious WAV file with an invalid sample rate or number of channels as input to the LAME encoder.
