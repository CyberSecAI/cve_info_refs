- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on the **Timeout** page in SAS Logon Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious code within a user's browser session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code, which is then reflected back to the user's browser through the vulnerable Timeout page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious link and trick a user into clicking it. This would typically involve social engineering or leveraging another vulnerability to inject the link.
