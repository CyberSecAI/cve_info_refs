Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the BuddyPress Activity Plus plugin, specifically in the `bpfb_remove_temp_images` and `bpfb_remove_temp_documents` actions. This, coupled with the use of `parse_str()` to process the 'data' parameter, allows an attacker to manipulate the file paths passed to the deletion function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **CSRF:** The plugin does not implement proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that will be executed by a logged-in user.
2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the combination of missing CSRF protection and the `parse_str()` function, an attacker can control the file paths passed to the deletion function (`bpfb_remove_temp_images` and `bpfb_remove_temp_documents`).
3.  **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The use of `parse_str()` on the `data` parameter allows for injection of multiple file paths through the use of array notation (e.g. `bpfb_photos[]=path1&bpfb_photos[]=path2`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can delete any file on the server that the PHP process has permissions to access. This includes configuration files (like `wp-config.php`) or files within the uploads directory. If the PHP user has broad permissions, this can result in significant data loss, service disruption, and potential compromise of the entire web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through crafted malicious links. An attacker tricks a logged-in user into clicking such a link or submitting a form, thus initiating the file deletion request via the victim's authenticated session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking on a malicious link. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or malicious advertisement.
2. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
3. The attacker needs to be able to construct the malicious URL or form data with the correct action and targeted file paths.
4. An attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the vulnerable site.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in version 1.5 of the BuddyPress Activity Plus plugin.
*   A similar vulnerability exists when the BP Group Documents plugin is also installed, using the `bpfb_remove_temp_documents` action.
*   The advisory notes that the vulnerability was discovered on 2013-08-22.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2015-07-13 and was fixed in version 1.6.2.
*   The CVSS score is rated as 8.5 (High).
