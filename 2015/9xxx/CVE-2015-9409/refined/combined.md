Years and years later, still the best, free, full-feature newsletter plugin. It takes a bit to learn, but everything is there.

I use it at three different WP Community Sites. The only one, that works fine without a big mail supplier in background.

### [Didn’t work](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/didnt-work-258/)

I installed, watched the video, followed the steps in it, and…nothing. The newsletter has stayed in “Pending” status.
I followed the troubleshooting steps, including installing a Cron viewer and the “Log Emails” plugin, and I found nothing. I searched the forum for the word “pending” (the status that I’m stuck in), and again nothing.
I’m sure this plug-in is good if you have some Wordpress or programming expertise, but for a lay user like me, I wouldn’t recommend it. I spent an hour on this and have nothing to show for it.

Ottimo supporto grandioso, il plugin funziona benissimo, è conforme alla GDPR ed è compatibile con woocommerce, lo sviluppatore è un grande, lavora anche di notte.
the best plugin for newsletter

Fa quello che dice, che è la cosa essenziale!
E se qualcuno (come me) non comprende qualcosa, l’autore è più che disponibile a chiarirgli le idee…
Grazie Alessandro!
