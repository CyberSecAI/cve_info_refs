Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress without properly escaping the URL being passed as the third parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** When an untrusted or unescaped URL is passed as the third parameter to `add_query_arg()` or `remove_query_arg()`, it can lead to the injection of malicious query parameters into the URL. This can be exploited in various ways depending on how the resulting URL is used, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other forms of attacks.
- **Improper URL Handling:** The functions `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`, if not used in conjunction with proper escaping such as `esc_url()`, create a vulnerability where malicious code can be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL. If this URL is then visited, the injected script could be executed in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Other URL-Based Attacks:** Depending on the context where the manipulated URL is used, attackers may be able to redirect users to malicious sites, manipulate user actions, or bypass security checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URLs:** An attacker could craft a URL containing malicious query parameters and trick a user into clicking it.
- **Injection via Parameters:** Vulnerable code does not properly validate or escape a URL that is used as parameter, so it is open to injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the website is using vulnerable versions of Easy Digital Downloads and how to exploit the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions without proper escaping.
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with malicious parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** In some cases, the attacker might need to trick a user into clicking a malicious URL.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was addressed in a security fix release on April 20, 2015, indicating that the affected versions were prior to the fix date.
- The blog post clarifies that not all uses of `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` are vulnerable; the vulnerability only occurs when the third parameter (the URL) is not properly escaped.
- The fix appears to have been pushed out as an automatic update, according to a comment from Pippin Williamson.
