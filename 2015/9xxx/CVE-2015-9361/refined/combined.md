# Several security updates released

![](https://www.barrykooij.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/several-security-updates-released-1024x333.jpg)

Today a coordinated security patch release has been done for many WordPress plugins including several of my plugins. Due the amount of posts that will be published regarding this release I’ll just focus on my plugins and what action is required from the user’s end.

## The vulnerability

Several of my plugins used `add_query_arg` without escaping the output resulting in an XSS vulnerability. All of my plugins only had this vulnerability in the WordPress backend meaning the XSS vulnerability could only be exploited if a logged in user would click a malicious link while being logged in. If you wish to read more on the security issue and how you can prevent it, I recommend you read [this article by Sucuri](https://blog.sucuri.net/?p=12400 "Security Advisory: XSS Vulnerability Affecting Multiple WordPress Plugins").

## Updates available

Updates for premium plugins will be automatically available if you’ve entered your license key in your WordPress backend. Please contact me via one of the links below if you’ve got any questions regarding updating your premium plugin. The following plugins I develop have been affected by this security issue and have patched updates available, thanks to the WP security team for helping coordinate this.

| Plugin | Secure version | Auto updated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Related Posts for WordPress | 1.8.2 | Yes |
| Related Posts for WordPress Premium | 1.3.4 | No |
| Download Monitor | 1.7.1/1.6.5\* | Yes |
| Post Connector | 1.0.4 | No |
| Post Connector Premium | 1.6.4 | No |

*\* Download Monitor received 2 automatic updates. Both 1.7.1 and 1.6.5 are patched secure versions.*

Above listed plugin updates should be available in your WordPress backend at this moment and for some of the plugins might already have been updated for you.

If you have any questions regarding these updates please don’t hesitate to send me an email:

* April 20, 2015

Multiple WordPress Plugins are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to the misuse of the **add\_query\_arg()** and **remove\_query\_arg()** functions. These are popular functions used by developers to modify and add query strings to URLs within WordPress.

The official WordPress Official Documentation (Codex) for these functions was not very clear and misled many plugin developers to use them in an insecure way. The developers assumed that these functions would escape the user input for them, when it does not. This simple detail, caused many of the most popular plugins to be vulnerable to XSS.

To date, this is the list of affected plugins:

* [Jetpack](https://jetpack.me/2015/04/20/jetpack-3-4-3-coordinated-security-update/)
* [WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/)
* Google Analytics by Yoast
* All In one SEO
* Gravity Forms
* Multiple Plugins from [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/?p=500387)
* [UpdraftPlus](http://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/)
* WP-E-Commerce
* WPTouch
* [Download Monitor](http://www.barrykooij.com/several-security-updates-released/)
* [Related Posts for WordPress](http://www.barrykooij.com/several-security-updates-released/)
* [My Calendar](https://www.joedolson.com/2015/04/important-security-fix-for-my-calendar/)
* P3 Profiler
* [Give](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give)
* Multiple [iThemes](https://ithemes.com/2015/04/20/coordinated-wordpress-plugin-security-update) products including Builder and Exchange
* Broken-Link-Checker
* Ninja Forms

There are probably a few more that we have not listed. If you use WordPress, we highly recommend that you go to your **wp-admin** dashboard and update any out of date plugins now.

This issue was first identified by Joost from Yoast in one of his plugins (he did a great [write up](https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/) about it as well). We worked together with him to investigate the issue and found that it likely affected a lot more plugins than just that one.

Our research team, along with a few friends (especially Joost from [Yoast](http://yoast.com/) ) have been going through the WordPress repository for the last few days in an attempt to find and warn as many plugin developers as possible – and to help them patch the issue.

##### Coordinated Disclosure

This vulnerability was initially discovered last week, due to the varying degrees of severity and more importantly, the large volume of plugins affected, we coordinated a joint security release with all developers involved and the WordPress core security team. It was great team work, and a pleasant experience to see so many developers united and working together for the common good. We can happily say that **all plugins have been patched, and as of this morning updates should be available to all users.** (yes, everyone pushed their updates in unison 2 hours ago).

If you use WordPress, now it is your turn to update your plugins!

If you have automatic updates enabled, your site should already be patched, especially in the most severe cases.

##### There Are More Plugins Vulnerable

Our team only analyzed the top 300-400 plugins, far from all of them as you might imagine. So there are likely a number of plugins still vulnerable. If you’re a developer, check your code to see how you are use these two functions:

```
add_query_arg
remove_query_arg
```

Make sure you are escaping them before use. We recommend using the **esc\_url() (or esc\_url\_raw())**functions with them. You should not assume that **add\_query\_arg** and **remove\_query\_arg** will escape user input. The WordPress team is providing more guidelines on how to use them [here](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/%20).

##### Update Time!

If you use any of these plugins, make sure to update them now! We will continue to investigate and look for more plugins vulnerable and keep our list here current.

This is also a good time to remind everyone that all software will have bugs and some of those bugs will inevitably lead to security vulnerabilities, such is the life we live in. This applies to plugins, themes, webservers, CMS’s and basically anything that is written by people and based on code. As much as developers try to minimize them and deploy secure coding principles, mistakes will inevitably still happen. We just have to be prepared and find ways to minimize the effect of any vulnerability in your environment; a perfect example of such an approach is what you’re seeing today with this coordinate release.

Here are some tips and tricks to help reduce your overall risk profile and help improve your security posture:

1. **Patch**. Keep your sites updated. Always.

1. **Restrict**. Restrictive access control.
   * *Restrict your wp-admin directory to only white listed IP Addresses. Only give admin access to users that really need it. Do not log in as admin unless you are really doing admin work. These are some examples of restrictive access control policies that can minimize the impact of vulnerabilities in your site.*
2. **Monitor**. Monitor your logs.
   * *They may give you clues to what is happening on your site*.
3. **Reduce your scope**. Only use the plugins (or themes) that your site really needs to function.

1. **Detect**. Prevention may fail, so we recommend scan your site for indicators of compromise or outdated software.
   * *[Our plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/) and [Sitecheck](https:///%3C/em%3E/sitecheck.sucuri.net) can do that for free for you.*
2. **Defense in Depth**. If you have an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) or Web Application Firewall (WAF), they can help block most common forms of XSS exploits.
   * You can even try our own [CloudProxy](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) to help you with that.
   * If you like the open source route, you can try OSSEC, Snort and ModSecurity to help you achieve that.

These principles are commonly applied to most secure networks (or on any business that needs to be PCI compliant), but not many website owners think of them for their own site / environment.

These are but a few high level recommendations; we recommend going through our [blog](https://blog.sucuri.net) for more ideas on how to keep your sites safe and ahead of the threats.

   “This vulnerability was initially discovered last week”
    This part isn’t technically true. This attack vector was first written about by Mike Jolley in 2013 on his blog. It was also the subject of a disclosure to WooCommerce on Jan 27 (which they patched the next day)

         I found similar issues in WP\_Supercache and Simple Page ordering during summer of 2014.

         Indeed there is an unfixed issue in one of our suppliers custom WordPress components which has the same cause (they have other reflected XSS suppression, which mistakenly leads them to think it is less important than it is).

         During discussion of those issues it was noted that the documentation wasn’t ideal, I’d assumed (perhaps incorrectly) this announcement was a follow-up to those discussions.

   I’m guessing users of Sucuri’s WAF should be safe nonetheless from these vulnerabilities?

   1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be1d83c8f5c20ab82263e2ca5178e647?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **[Thomas Zickell](http://tomzickell.com)** says: [April 20, 2015 at 7:45 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins.html#comment-6181)

      If you think about what the WAF does it give you a huge amount of protection over sites not using any real security methods.
       The application exploits are going to be much harder and if not impossible to conduct behind a strong WAF like Sucuri CloudProxy
       (keep in mind nothing his hack proof not even the most expensive or advanced system though the risk is reduced to a extremely small amount compared to non-protected sites )
       So you do not have to scramble as others may because the Sucuri SOC has already done that for you. Now with that said it is wise to keep your software updated regardless of what you using to protect your site. My recommendation is to use both the WAF & yes update your site plugins because security extremely important and these updates will make what is extremely unlikely to occur using a web application firewall impossible to occur.

      1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5cc13c003f939f383453910d8b8e9a?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **Simon Waters (Surevine)** says: [April 21, 2015 at 9:32 am](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins.html#comment-6187)

         A lot of WAFs will spot reflected XSS, but neither spot, or stop, attempts at enhanced social engineering via the same failure to escape. Ditto browser XSS auditing tools.

         Mozilla security folk are right that the correct approach for this is a CSP, and not to use inline JS, there is a WordPress plugin that will generate a CSP for your site, but I haven’t tested (or security tested(!!!)) it yet. But this approach too doesn’t stop the option for enhanced social engineering. Ultimately you need programmers to do it right, and to test to make sure they have.

   Has anyone heard of these vulnerabilities / these specific plugins actually being exploited in the wild? Haring something claiming to be related, but guessing it’s maybe existing malware on a users computer that’s just been alerted to this and trying to exploit it… still skeptical and don’t have sufficient info from that user to say definitively either way.

      I’ve only checked a few, but it seems quite difficult to exploit these. Not impossible, mind you, but it would rely on a very specific set of circumstances.

         I suppose it happens whenever something like this get’s announced, everyone blames everything on it… I think this is why my car brakes started making noise this morning.

   “we coordinated a joint security release with all developers involved and the WordPress core security team”

   Any chance that in future you could let us (Envato) know in advance as well, so we can work out a plan before it’s announced? Even if we can’t reach out to all authors in advance, we could work out which plugins will be affected, prepare our communications, etc. It’d be great if you could give us a heads up too! 🙂

   we have a few plugins in use that are ancient is there any easy way to test plugins to find out other they have this hole in them? also is there anyway to know which if any plugins have been autoupdated? thanks!

      @ubernaut:disqus – You have to look in the code of the plugin and see if the following is used and not escaped…

      add\_query\_arg
       remove\_query\_arg

         not sure if i’d be able to tell 🙁 should the “esc\_url() (or esc\_url\_raw()” be close by to the other terms?

         1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/411549e5cfc35b7443e6a1dd5aa8db9b?s=60&d=mm&r=g) **Phil** says: [April 21, 2015 at 6:12 pm](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins.html#comment-6195)

            Yes! The esc\_url should wrap the other…..

            Esc\_url(add\_query\_arg())

    Thanks so much to all developers involved, the WordPress core security team and Sucuri for the advisory. Daniel I posted your Blog and a link back to your site for additional info in a email to all the Austin WordPress members, some of us don’t make it to all the Meetups or check in on group’s site everyday so I thought this justified an ‘all-hands’ email. We have also posted the blog on the group’s facebook page. Thank you for being so generous with your information and reaching out to the community with this advisory, we appreciate your team’s work.

    Good to know! Last week my site was hacked, but the hacker got into my site through contact -form plugin, which wasn’t listed here.
     What interesting is that, the plugin was deactivated. Is it still possible? Does it mean that I have update all plugins whether they are active or not?

       Inactive plugins should be deleted. If you need them in the future, they can be re-installed easy enough.

    What about 50mm gallery? I’ve been using that to display my portfolio but lately it doesn’t allow me to add new photos into any of the galleries, even if I create a brand new one. I can upload to the media library but not transfer to the galleries. I’ve had multiple people look at it and no one can tell me what’s going on — could something have affected it that has something to do with this? I’m just not sure what to do.

    Hi Daniel,
     Good to be here,
     Today while I was adding a twitter
     plugin suddenly my page disappeared, I mean i received a message
     message from my service providers, saying Account “Account Suspended”
     Immediately
     i contacted my friend who is taking care of such technical aspects of
     my page and he contacted the service providers and they said they found
     some suspicious plugin so they stopped it, my friend send a complaint
     ticket and am still waiting to fix the problem, hopefully in another
     hour or so it will be fixed.

    This post speaks lot of things on this aspects this link my online friend
     David Leonhardt send to me in time and is very useful to know a bit more
     about wordPress plugins.
     Thanks for sharing
     Have a great day
     ~ Philip

    Thanks for finding this issue and warning us!

    A question though:
     Has it been considered to fix this in the functions mentioned themselves?
     If you would filter the input within the functions, then all plugins would be safe with the update of WP without the need to fix each plugin individually.
     An argument as to that it would cost too much resources doesn’t hold as the filter has to be executed nonetheless.

    Any remarks?

       Exactly what I was thinking. Why wouldn’t they just fix it in WordPress instead of making sure every plugin developer updates their code.

    This CMS went from Rocket to a bat sprocket. So many vulnerabilities, so many bugs. I got tired to secure it. I have over 200 projects built with WP and my customers are getting tired also of spending money on security.
     Next step is to migrate to Joomla and even if will take 2 years I will get back to Joomla. Because it’s simply the best.

    Is esc\_html() sufficient to address the issue, or will only esc\_url() or esc\_url\_raw() do the job? I’ve run into a plugin which passes add\_query\_arg() to wp\_nonce\_url(), which uses esc\_html().

    I’m using these functions, but never echo urls – I’m outputting with wp\_safe\_redirect() and a \_wpnonce – am I still vulnerable? I’m no hacker, so I don’t get this stuff very easily. If I am vulnerable, how does one escape output in a line like this:

    wp\_safe\_redirect( add\_query\_arg( $redirect\_args, remove\_query\_arg( array( ‘action’, ‘\_wpnonce’ ) ) ) );

    Seems to me like WP should have updated the core (perhaps with a wrapper function) immediately, whilst giving developers a chance to update on their end since it’s a core issue and not a 3rd party code issue.
