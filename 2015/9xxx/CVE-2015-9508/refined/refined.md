The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) on April 20, 2015. It doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2015-9508. However, the discussion about the vulnerability and fix aligns with typical scenarios described in CVEs related to URL manipulation and redirection.

Based on the comments, the vulnerability stems from the usage of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress without proper sanitization. Specifically, if the 3rd parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL, it can lead to a vulnerability. The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of user-controlled URLs used in query arguments.

Here is a summary of the relevant details:

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of URLs passed to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unescaped URLs in query arguments, leading to potential open redirection or other URL-based attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious sites or perform other attacks by manipulating the URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click on it or use the manipulated URL on the vulnerable website. The attacker does not require any special privileges.

The vulnerability is related to the improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` when the third parameter is an unsanitized URL, which can lead to URL manipulation attacks.
