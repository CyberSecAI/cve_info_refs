### Bug Description

when instance console is accessed auth token is displayed nova-consoleauth.log

and

nova-novncproxy.log:30:2015-09-02 14:20:52 31927 INFO nova.console.websocketproxy [req-a29ab7d8-ab26-4ef2-b942-9bb02d5703a0 None None] 3: connect info: {u'instance\_uuid': u'dd29a899-0076-4978-aa50-8fb752f0c3ed', u'internal\_access\_path': None, u'last\_activity\_at': 1441203636.387588, u'console\_type': u'novnc', u'host': u'192.168.245.6', u'token': u'f8ea537c-b924-4d92-935e-4c22ec90d5f7', u'access\_url': u'<http://192.168.245.9:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=f8ea537c-b924-4d92-935e-4c22ec90d5f7'>, u'port': u'5900'}

This token has a short lifetime but the exposure still represents a potential security weakness, especially as the log record in question are INFO level and thus available via centralized logging. A user with real time access to these records could mount a denial of service attack by accessing the instance console and performing a ctl alt del to reboot it

Alternatively data privacy could be compromised if the attacker were able to obtain user credentials

I'm sort of surprised there is an OSSA for this. We've had many cases of leaked passwords in the nova logs, like when logging connection\_info from a block device mapping (might have the admin userid/password in it from the Cinder volume connection) - that kind of thing gets logged quite a bit at debug level. And from what I can remember, we haven't had OSSAs for those changes in the past.

VMT has always considered password leak in logs file OSSA worthy, excepted in DEBUG mode.

Is there a bug for the connection\_info from a block device mapping issue ?

@Tristan, there is a related nova [bug 1321785](/bugs/1321785) for the connection\_info field in block\_device\_mapping - and what comes back from cinder's os-initialize\_connection API, which keystoneclient was logging the response, fixed here:

Matt, that ([bug 1490693](/bugs/1490693)) seems to be an exposure only at DEBUG level, for which we've never issued advisories and always classified as security hardening improvements instead.

Paul, it means that for [bug 1490693](/bugs/1490693) if you backport those we still don't need to issue a security advisory.

For the current bug, the credential leak seems to be at INFO level, which is a situation where we typically do issue an advisory.

Note that this bug is stalled waiting for the master branch fix to get unstuck. We need that and working backports to affected stable branches, then the VMT can issue an advisory.

Oh, except the first comma in the affects line is misleading. "=>2015.1 <=2015.1.2, ==12.0.0" would make it clearer the first two versions there indicate the bounds of a range.

If we get backports for other supported stable branches, we can probably still issue an advisory for this using Tristan's last impact description in comment #24, it would definitely need the affected versions field updated though.

I'm not sure what to think about this one as it's been around for years and we unfortunately have another INFO log exposure [1] of the console auth token that occurred relatively recently [2]:

INFO nova.console.websocketproxy [-] 10.209.96.111 - - [04/Dec/2019 03:29:50] 10.209.96.111:

  Path: '?token=3e631f39-b5c7-4bba-a5c2-8c76359e71d9'

This one, I don't yet know how to suppress because this logging is coming from the underlying websockify third-party code, not nova code.

So, given that the recent fix doesn't get us out of the woods, I'm not sure whether an advisory at this stage would be useful. I'm not opposed to one though.

Thanks for the update, and I agree it sounds like there's not yet a good argument for an advisory. Maybe we need to include a warning somewhere (install docs? security guide?) that short-lived console access credentials can be leaked in hypervisor host logs, and to take appropriate precautions when granting access to those logs.

As for the websockify leak, is there a corresponding bug opened upstream with its maintainers?

Short-lived depends on the configured TTL (default is 10 minutes) and they are unintentionally leaked in the INFO logs of the nova-novncproxy console proxy service [1], which does not run on the hypervisor. It's a separate service that is run on a per cell basis.

For the websockify leak, it is not websockify that is directly responsible for the leak because their code is (and has always) logged the "Path" with which the websockify server was called. So, I don't think it's a bug on their part.

To explain the background: earlier this year, novnc made a change to their code to stop supporting built-in token query parameter forwarding to the websockify server. We proposed a partial revert [2] that was NACKed by the maintainers and their guidance was for us to embed our auth token into the "Path" query parameter instead, which is (and has always) been passed through to the websockify server code. There was no other way to get the token passed into websockify so that we could validate it in nova. However, when we made that change, the token began being logged as part of the normal "Path" logging. I personally can't think of another way to stop it other than to adjust our websockify server logging level config to WARN, if that is possible.

Thanks again for the clarification. So to restate, the novnc maintainers recommend using websockify in a way which exposes authentication tokens in logs, and don't provide any means of mitigating the resulting credential leak. This puts consumers of their software in an unfortunate position, and suggests that we should not continue to encourage use of Nova's novnc integration except in cases where operators are comfortable assuming that risk and taking measures to secure the logs of their per-cell nova-novncproxy daemons.

Well, I was thinking maybe we could do something similar to this patch, where we changed the default log level of the oslo.privsep daemon to log at INFO instead of its default DEBUG, in nova:

<https://review.opendev.org/#/c/586643/2/nova/config.py>

So I was thinking for websockify we could do similar and set the level to WARN instead of INFO.

Doing that isn't ideal for debugging though because we'd miss logs about whether the proxy is running with TLS support, which I have used for troubleshooting before in the past, example:

If we can also get a patch backported for stable/rocky then we should be able to issue an advisory for this once it merges. Otherwise we can issue an advisory when that branch goes into extended maintenance (estimated one month from today).
