Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in the CP Contact Form with PayPal WordPress plugin, specifically version 1.1.5, which aligns with CVE-2015-9233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of proper security measures within the plugin's administrative interface. Specifically, the plugin does not implement sufficient checks to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and SQL Injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin's admin area lacks CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions, such as:
    *   Creating new forms
    *   Modifying existing form settings
    *   Exporting CSV files of messages
    *   Deleting forms
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS attacks through the settings form. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields, which will then be executed in the context of other users who access the admin panel.
*   **SQL Injection:**  The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cp_contactformpp_id` parameter in the settings form. This could allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or performing unauthorized database modifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
*   **Unauthorized modifications to website content and settings:** An attacker could add or modify forms to redirect users to malicious sites or obtain their information.
*   **Data theft or manipulation:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially access sensitive database information or modify data used by the plugin.
*   **Account compromise:** By injecting malicious code via XSS, an attacker could potentially steal admin cookies or session information, allowing for complete compromise of the website.
*   **Denial of service:** Malicious changes to the plugin configuration or excessive SQL queries could lead to service disruption

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in admin user to click on a crafted link or submit a crafted form.
*   **XSS:** An attacker would need to craft malicious input that is processed by the plugin's settings form and viewed by another admin.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker would need to modify the `cp_contactformpp_id` parameter using a crafted SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. This can be achieved by sending a link via email or by hosting a website that triggers the action when visited.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs access to the plugin's settings form to inject the malicious code. This would typically involve being an authenticated admin or exploiting another vulnerability to gain admin access.
*   **SQL Injection:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious HTTP request to the plugin settings form with a modified `cp_contactformpp_id` parameter. This could be done with or without admin access depending on the environment and other potential vulnerabilities.
