- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the Synology Note Station application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to XSS attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially gaining access to private user data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts, presumably through input fields or other areas where user-controlled data is rendered in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, typically through user input or other methods that allow control over rendered data. The attacker would need to trick a user into accessing the malicious content.
