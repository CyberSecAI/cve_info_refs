## Description

If you’re working on your website and would like to make it known to your visitors, install the plugin YITH Maintenance Mode to quickly set a lovely customizable page to let your visitors know the site is closed for maintenance.

**A working demo is available [here](http://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-maintenance-mode/).**

Full documentation is available [here](http://yithemes.com/docs-plugins/yith_maintenance_mode/).

This plugin is 100% compatible with [WPML](http://wpml.org/?aid=24889&affiliate_key=Qn1wDeBNTcZV)

#### Installation

Once you have installed the plugin, you just need to activate the plugin in order to enable it.

#### Configuration

YITH Maintenance Mode will add a new page under Appearance -> Maintenance Mode, where you can configure the plugin and customize the frontend page.

#### GDPR Disclaimer

As you can see in [Google FAQ](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users):

###

The Google Fonts API is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to what is needed to serve fonts efficiently. […] Google Fonts logs records of the CSS and the font file requests, and access to this data is kept secure. […] We use data from Google’s web crawler to detect which websites use Google fonts.

###

In other words, when someone visits your website, Google will be able to access the IP address they used to access it. As a result of using Google Fonts, you implicitly accept their terms and conditions, and you must inform people visiting your site of this in accordance with the current GDPR law in Europe.

#### Developer

Are you a developer? Want to customize the templates or the style of the plugin? Read on the [documentation](http://yithemes.com/docs-plugins/yith_maintenance_mode/) and discover how to do that.

### Suggestions

If you have suggestions about how to improve YITH Maintenance Mode, you can write us so we can bundle them into YITH Maintenance Mode.

### Translators

#### Available Languages

* English (Default)
* Dutch
* Italian
* Spanish

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update for an existing one, you can send [gettext PO and MO file](https://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress "Translating WordPress")

  General settings

## Installation

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH Maintenance Mode` from Plugins page

## FAQ

### Can I customize the maintenance mode page?

Yes, the page is a simple template and you can override it by putting the file template “maintenance.php” inside the theme folder. You can also customize the style by adding your custom CSS in the specific option of the settings.

### Have I deactive the plugin to deactive the maintenance mode page?

No, you can deactive the maintenance mode page even if the plugin is active.

### What are the main changes in plugin translation?

Recently this plugin has been selected to be included in the “translate.wordpress.org” translate programme. In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form ‘yit’ to ‘yith-maintenance-mode’. Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org. During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in: yith-maintenance-mode-.po yith-woocommerce-ajax-navigation-.mo. For example, if your language files were named yit-en\_GB.po and yit-en\_GB.mo, you will just have to rename them respectively as yith-maintenance-mode-en\_GB.po and yith-maintenance-mode-en\_GB.mo.

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/yith-maintenance-mode/)

This plugin locked me completely out of my wordpress site. Neither /wp-admin nor /admin let me log in again. All I got was “Page not found”. Removed the plugin via FTP and I’m back in business.
Unacceptable!
