## FAQ

### How It Works

* the user will be displayed online, if he/she had left the site, but the time when the user is considered being online is not yet passed.
* to define the user`s country, you will need to download the file according to the instruction <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxxeDleJdPS8HvRdYwYSABQ586t1s-Z8r6wy55iXJCM/>
* if the number of visits from different countries is the same, the plugin will display several countries, but not more than three;
* if the number of visits from different browsers is the same, the plugin will display several browsers, but not more than three

### I get “Not enough rights to import from the IpToCountry.csv file” error. What shall I do?

You should set rights 755 to the folders wp-content, plugins, visitors-online and 644 to the IpToCountry.csv file. In such case the plugin’s script will have enough rights to upload the file. Here is some useful information for you <https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions#Shared_Hosting_with_suexec>.

### Where can I find statistics?

You can see statistics on the admin panel, in any place of a post (if using shortcode), or in a widget (if this widget is added to the sidebar).

### Why do the number of users online displayed in statistics is greater, than it actually is?

The user will be displayed online if he/she had left the site, but the time, when the user is considered being online, is not yet passed.

### How bots are defined?

The plugin receives data from the server variable $\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_USER\_AGENT’], and searches the resulting value in its list of the most common bots. Once a match was found, the visitor is considered being a bot.

### Why the information about the day with the maximum number of visits does not match the number of actual visitors?

The plugin counts the number of the site visitors during the day. If the same user visits the site 5 times during the day, the plugin sees 5 visits, but not one. The visit means that a user enters the site or console as a guest user or bot, and stays within the time set on the plugin settings page. (The time period when the user is online, without making any actions).

### How can I load GeoIP?

1. Download the necessary file by a link <http://software77.net/geo-ip/?DL=2&x=Download>.
2. Unzip the file IpToCountry.csv.zip to a folder {your\_site\_folder}/wp-content/plugins/visitor-online/geolite-country.
3. Go to the settings page of the plugin Visitors Online by a link http://{your\_domain}/wp-admin/admin.php?page=visitors-online.php or Admin Panel->Visitors Online.
4. Find an option “Import Database” and click “Import” button.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wi2X8RdRGXk9kMszQy1xItJrpN0ncXgioH935MaBKtc/edit)

### [Soooo Frustrating](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/soooo-frustrating/)

[itsjanel](https://profiles.wordpress.org/itsjanel/ "Posts by itsjanel")

I had high hopes for the Visitors Online plugin by BestWebSoft, but it turned out to be way too complicated to use. The plugin shows live visitor counts, which is great, but the data structure is a huge issue. It gives you the option to make changes in the settings, but if you actually use that feature, the whole thing breaks. There’s a list of “allowed variables” you’re supposed to be able to edit, like removing bots, guests, or max visits. However, if you delete too many—especially if you try to remove everything except “visitors online”—it stops working and just shows zero visitors.
The only way to make changes without breaking it is to remove one or two things at a time, saving after each change. Even then, it still breaks if you remove more than three items. You also have to constantly clear your cache and reset the settings just to keep it running. I don’t understand why the plugin says it allows these changes if doing so causes it to fail. I just wanted a simple live visitor counter, but this plugin makes it way too hard.
Bottom line: It’s not worth the hassle. The plugin doesn’t even work with its own rules.

Plugin occassionally starts counting every visitors but forgot to remove old ones. In effect I see a lot of visitors, but it isn’t true.
