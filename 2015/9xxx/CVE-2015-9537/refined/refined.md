Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2015-9537:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization of several parameters within the NextGEN Gallery plugin. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input when handling specific parameters, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the NextGEN Gallery WordPress plugin. These vulnerabilities are located in the following parameters:
    *   `thumbnail_width`
    *   `thumbnail_height`
    *    `thumbwidth`
    *   `thumbheight`
    *   `wmXpos`
    *   `wmYpos`
    *   `template` (multiple instances, including in basic thumbnails, image browser, singlepic, compact album, and extended album configurations)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable parameters. This allows an attacker to:
    *   Hijack a logged-in user's session by stealing their cookies.
    *   Change the logged-in user's password and invalidate the victim's session while the attacker maintains access.
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP POST requests containing XSS payloads within the vulnerable parameters.
*   The attacker would need to target administrative interfaces of WordPress using the vulnerable plugin.
*   The attacker could exploit the vulnerability by navigating to the plugin settings page and injecting malicious scripts in the above-mentioned input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site's administrative interface.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and how to inject XSS payloads.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the NextGEN Gallery settings page.
*   A user with sufficient privileges to modify plugin settings would be required to be targeted by the attack.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found in NextGEN Gallery version 2.1.7.
*   It was fixed in version 2.1.10.
*   The vulnerability was tested with "Unfiltered HTML Settings" enabled in WordPress, suggesting the vulnerability is present even with default WordPress security settings.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the WordPress plugin team, and a patch was released.
