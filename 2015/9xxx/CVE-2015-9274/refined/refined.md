The provided content is related to CVE-2015-9274.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing return statements in several `dispatch` functions within the HarfBuzz library. Specifically, these functions are located in `hb-ot-layout-gpos-table.hh`, `hb-ot-layout-gsub-table.hh`, and `hb-ot-layout-gsubgpos-private.hh`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is the absence of `return` statements after the `if (unlikely (!c->may_dispatch (this, &u.format)))` check. This leads to the code continuing to execute, potentially causing an invalid read of two bytes when the `switch` statement is reached without the necessary pre-conditions being met. This could result in unexpected behavior or a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a potential invalid read of two bytes, which could lead to a crash or other undefined behavior. It does not specify remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious font file that triggers the vulnerable code paths within the HarfBuzz library, leading to the missing return issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted malicious font file. They don't need to be in any special position.
