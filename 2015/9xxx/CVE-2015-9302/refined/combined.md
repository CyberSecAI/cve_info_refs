I was very happy with this plugin until the moment I needed to dynamically add content that needed a textarea with “Use HTML-editor” checked (aka TinyMCE). It gives a javascript error and won’t add a new row of fields.
Please FIX and you’ll have my 5 stars

Very useful plugin to create custom fields not available in my theme.

This is THE BEST plugin!
I use it for EVERY project I do for clients. First one I install.
It is incredibly powerful and flexible once you get your head around it.
I can’t imagine a project without it.
Better documentation would be nice, but it’s there – just need to search a bit…
Oh – and I love the fact that it’s hidden under the settings menu – so polite and unobtrusive. Great plugin.

Seems to be a worthless plug-in that I just wasted 15 minutes of my time.
You set up fields and then what?
It makes no sense and gets a 1-star from me……….
