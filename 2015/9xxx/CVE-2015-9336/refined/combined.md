  WPML. Certificate of Compatibility

## Installation

### Installation

* Install **Clean Login** automatically through the WordPress Dashboard or by uploading the ZIP file in the *plugins* directory.
* Then, after the package is uploaded and extracted, click *Activate Plugin*.

Now going through the points above, you should now see a new *Clean Login* menu item under Settings menu in the sidebar of the admin panel, see figure below of how it looks like.

[Setting Menu image link](https://ps.w.org/clean-login/assets/screenshot-8.jpg)

If you get any error after following through the steps above please contact us through item support comments so we can get back to you with possible helps in installing the plugin and more. On successful activation of this plugin, you should be able to see the login form when you place this shortcode *[clean-login]* in any page or post

### Settings

Below, the description of each shortcode for use as registration, login, lost password and profile editor forms

* *[clean-login]* This shortcode contains login form and login information.
* *[clean-login-edit]* This shortcode contains the profile editor. If you include in a page/post a link will appear on your login preview.
* *[clean-login-register]* This shortcode contains the register form. If you include in a page/post a link will appear on your login form.
* *[clean-login-restore]* This shortcode contains the restore (lost password?) form. If you include in a page/post a link will appear on your login form.

Also, in the Clean Login settings page you can check the plugin status as follows:

[Plugin status image link](https://ps.w.org/clean-login/assets/screenshot-9.jpg)

In this setting page you can also find the way to enable/disable the differents options of the plugin, like below:

[Options image link](https://ps.w.org/clean-login/assets/screenshot-10.jpg)

Regarding the widget usage, just place the *Clean Login status and links* widget in the widget area you prefer. It will show the user status and the links to the pages/posts which contains the plugin shortcodes.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

### Example

A post/page need to be created by typing the main shortcode *[clean-login]* in the content.

When you save or update this post/page you will see the login form.

And also in the setting page *[clean-login]* entry will be updated pointing to the current post/page which contains the shortcode (and generates the login form):

[Settings updated image link](https://ps.w.org/clean-login/assets/screenshot-11.jpg)

We would repeat the same process with the rest of shortcodes if we need it:

* *[clean-login-edit]* to create an edit profile form
* *[clean-login-register]* to create a registration form
* *[clean-login-restore]* to create a forgotten password and restore form

## FAQ

* Can I use my email in addition to your username for login? Yes, through [WP Email Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-email-login/).
* Can I modify my Avatar? Clean Login uses your email to get your Avatar from the Gravatar service (from Automattic), but if you want to modify from the WordPress dashboard you can use [WP User Avatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/).
* Is Clean Login compatible with AJAX-based plugins/themes/queries? Yes, from the version 1.2.6.
* Can I change the sender name from WordPress to my domain name? Yes, through [WP Simple Mail Sender](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-simple-mail-sender/).

I tried a number of login registration plugins and became disillusioned when the majority started to ask for payment for what should be the basic roles for forms, ie: payment (Upgrade) if I want to redirect users after login or when registering. Why? I’m not to bothered about drag and drop or ‘Enhancing’ the colour scheme or rounded edges, I just wanted a login/register page and the ability to redirect users to why they were logging in. Maybe you can tell that I’m bothered by this issue with so called login and registration forms by the amount I’m typing to say ‘Thank You’ guys at Clean Login. It not only does what I want it to do, without the cost (Stupid Cost) of other plugins – being free but I can add Google Capture (Also another ‘Expense’ with Some)! Honeypot works fine, plus if I want to code it there’s the CSS option. Disabling access to the admin area for certain roles or all roles that register is a plus and a bonus, password complexity, a notification email to registered users that I can customize and the simple shortcodes to add to any page I want to ceate to call my login/register page, rather than have them done for me which is a pain when you want to unistall a plugin when it starts asking for money for its basic use, why don’t they take their pages with them?
Anyway – Thanks again, anyone looking for a simple yet effective plugin and doesn’t want to pay stupid prices for the privilege, I certainly recommend this one.

How could you forget about ajax? Why reload the page. I even tried to login to your site, and there it opened in a modal window, and after an incorrect input, the page reloads, it looks like a bug. After all, it’s great when you can enter incorrect data and you will be given a message stating that you entered something incorrectly WITHOUT RELOADING. I will give 5 stars when ajax is added.

Simple and does what it claims to, but not easy to be added in the nav menu. I want it to be added and when a login is successful the”Login” phrase gets converted into “Logout”. Otherwise, it’s so useful.
Best Regards

He probado este plugin animado por lo bien que me fue otro plugin (First payment date for WooCommerce Subscriptions) de los mismos desarrolladores.
Ha sido una gran decisión porque, igual que el plugin mencionado antes, este también me va de maravilla. Fue fácil personalizar el login de la intranet de mi sitio de muchas maneras diferentes que no habría pensado que se podía si no fuera por este plugin.
Gracias, Codection!. Estaré pendiente de cuando saquéis más plugins.
