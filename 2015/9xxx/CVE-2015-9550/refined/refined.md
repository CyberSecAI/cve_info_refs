The provided content describes a backdoor vulnerability in several TOTOLINK router models, which is identified as CVE-2015-9550.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded backdoor implemented through the `/bin/skt` binary, which acts as a TCP server on port 5555. This binary is executed at startup by the `/etc/init.d/rcS` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Backdoor:** The `skt` binary contains hardcoded strings ("hel,xasf", "oki,xasf") that, when received over TCP on port 5555, trigger `system()` calls to manipulate firewall rules.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The backdoor is accessible without any authentication, via any network interface, including the WAN interface.
*   **Firewall Manipulation:** The backdoor's commands modify iptables rules to open or close the web management interface to/from the WAN interface.
*   **ECHO Server behavior:** When the binary is called without arguments it behaves as an echo server on port 5555/tcp.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Access to Management Interface:** An attacker can remotely open the HTTP management interface on the WAN, which is usually closed to external access.
*   **Prerequisite for RCE:** This is the first part of the attack chain, as it is required to make the management interface accessible before an attacker can leverage the RCE vulnerability described in CVE-2015-9551.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send specific commands ("hel,xasf", "oki,xasf") via a TCP connection to port 5555 of the router's WAN IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send TCP packets to the router's WAN IP address on port 5555.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No credentials or authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

The advisory also provides netcat commands for testing and exploiting the backdoor:

*   Open the HTTP remote management interface on the Internet: `echo -ne "hel,xasf" | nc <ip> 5555`
*   Close the HTTP remote management interface on the Internet: `echo -ne "oki,xasf" | nc <ip> 5555`
*   Detect a vulnerable router: `echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1" | nc <ip> 5555` (if the response contains "GET / HTTP/1.1", the router is likely vulnerable)

The advisory notes that devices using PPPoE connections are not affected because the WAN IP is attached on the ppp device and not eth1.
