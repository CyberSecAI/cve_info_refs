    "root_cause": "The NextGEN Gallery plugin fails to validate user input in the 'dir' variable within a POST request, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access unauthorized files on the server, potentially including system files and other sensitive data. It also allows viewing the source code and configuration files of other websites hosted on the same server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a POST request to `http://localhost/wordpress/?photocrati_ajax=1` and modifying the 'dir' variable with directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../../).",
    "required_capabilities": "A logged-in user can exploit the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed other than being able to access the affected functionality of the plugin."
