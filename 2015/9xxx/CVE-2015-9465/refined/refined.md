Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2015-9465

**Vulnerability Description:**

The provided content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in version 0.9.0 of the "Yet Another Stars Rating" WordPress plugin. This vulnerability allows remote authenticated users with the 'publish\_posts' role to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `set_id` parameter in the `yasr_send_id_nameset` AJAX action. Specifically, the `set_id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query within the `yasr_get_multi_set_values_and_field()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the query in the response but can infer information based on response times or other indirect indicators.
*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`set_id` parameter) before using it in SQL queries, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the WordPress database.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to escalate privileges.
*   **Website Compromise:** The attacker could potentially compromise the entire website and server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `yasr_send_id_nameset` action.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `set_id` parameter in the POST data is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
*   **'publish\_posts' Role:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with the 'publish\_posts' role or a role that has the necessary capabilities to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details (from Content):**

*   The vulnerable function call stack is:
    *   `yasr_output_multiple_set_callback` in `/yet-another-stars-rating/lib/yasr-ajax-functions.php:192`
    *   `yasr_get_multi_set_values_and_field` in `yet-another-stars-rating/lib/yasr-db-functions.php:220`
    *   `wpdb::get_results`
*   The content includes an example of how to verify the SQL injection using `sqlmap`.
* The vulnerable plugin version is 0.9.0, but the provided analysis was based on version 3.4.12 which is not vulnerable.
