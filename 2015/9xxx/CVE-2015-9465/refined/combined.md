I‚Äôve been using the plugin for its ratings and schema markup management capabilities. Specifically, I‚Äôm using the recipe schema and it so happened that Google changed its requirements as to which fields were optional and which were mandatory. Since the plugin was missing a field which became mandatory, Search Console started to flag my URLs as invalid.
I got in touch with the support about the missing field issue, and the field was added to the plugin in 2 days, which I found amazing! Plus, I got notified about the patch being ready, and even got a copy of the updated plugin as an attachment to an email message before the official release to the WordPress plugin store!
Huge kudos to the dev and support teams!
And one more thing‚Ä¶
I use the free version of the plugin, and I got a truly VIP treatment! Way to go team, way to go!

This is an amazing plugin. I spent days searching for one that will do what I need. The only thing I think this plugin is lacking is the option to add featured images to the top post results. I feel that is a big need for me, but it‚Äôs also something easy for them to add so I‚Äôm sure it wont be too long before its added and becomes the best plugin for this. IF I could find the code that displays the results I could add it, but I couldn‚Äôt locate it.

We are building a major destination website that will allow ratings and reviews of ~2,000 colleges and universities.
We evaluated several plugins, and this was the only one we found that came close to meeting our needs. I was literally about to start writing our own plugin before we found YASR.
David has been great at helping to solve some unusual requirements and even sent pointers to sections of code to help me understand the data structures.

After 1 month, I‚Äôve discovered why my website received errors 500, 502, 503, 504. It was this plugin! A lot of another plugins was bugged thank this plugin and I could not work.
When i was lucky to join on wp-admin, after a click I received internal errors. I was terribly angry with my hosting.
1 month before server crash, I‚Äôve asked support to this plugin to solve incompatibility with plugin optimole. Stars disabled and both plugins don‚Äôt wanted help me.
I‚Äôm so happy to have removed this plugin. It‚Äôs a a maleware!
