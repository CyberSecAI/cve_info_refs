Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9097:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of recipient email addresses in the `mail` Ruby gem. Specifically, the library does not prevent the injection of arbitrary SMTP commands through the recipient address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SMTP Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary SMTP commands into the data stream sent to the SMTP server by crafting a malicious email address.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `mail` gem failed to validate or sanitize recipient addresses, allowing attackers to insert newline characters and other SMTP commands within the recipient field.
- **No Length Limitation**: The gem does not impose a length limit on email addresses, which can cause overflows in some old SMTP servers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Spamming:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to send spam emails using a vulnerable server.
- **Email Spoofing:** Attackers may be able to manipulate headers, potentially spoofing sender addresses or inserting additional recipients.
- **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, attackers may be able to extract confidential information.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not directly stated, the ability to send large volumes of email might cause a denial-of-service situation.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the SMTP server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Recipient Addresses:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the recipient email address, injecting SMTP commands directly.
- **Input Fields:** Vulnerable applications typically have user input fields such as inquiry forms or signup forms which allows a user specified email address, and if not validated by the application can be leveraged to conduct this attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Supply a Recipient Address:** The attacker must have the capability to specify the recipient email address through an application that uses the vulnerable version of the `mail` gem.
- **Knowledge of SMTP Protocol:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the SMTP protocol to craft effective injection strings.
- **Unvalidated application input**: Vulnerable applications lack proper input validation and sanitization.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `mail` gem versions 2.5.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.0 of the gem by implementing proper sanitization and validation to disallow line breaks and very long addresses.
- The issue was discovered and reported by Takeshi Terada of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
- The vulnerability is described in detail in a whitepaper titled "SMTP Injection via recipient email addresses".
- The root cause was considered to be within the `Net::SMTP` library as well, but the `mail` gem implemented a fix to mitigate it.
- While newer versions of Ruby's `Net::SMTP` disallow newline characters in addresses, older versions and other SMTP implementations did not, thus a validation was added in the `mail` gem.
- The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2015-9097
- The fix was backported to versions 2.5.5 and 2.6.6
