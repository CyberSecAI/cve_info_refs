Validate addresses passed as SMTP command arguments to prevent

injection of other SMTP commands. Disallow line breaks and very

long addresses which may cause overflows on some old SMTP servers.

Ruby 2.4 Net::SMTP already disallows addresses that contain newlines.

Enforce this validation in Mail to cover older Ruby versions and

other SMTP implementations that don't validate input.

| [@jordan-brough](https://github.com/jordan-brough) Expect an official 2.6.6 after RC1 has had a fair number of installs to shake out regressions. Note than 2.6.x is (coincidentally) not vulnerable to this issue, thanks to [#505](https://github.com/mikel/mail/pull/505) stripping CRLF from header values. |

1.  Introduction

SMTP Injection is an attack technique that injects attacker-controlled SMTP commands into

the data transmitted from an application (typically a web application) to an SMTP server for

spamming purposes.

Among this class of attack, techniques using manipulated content (message body or header)

have been published and known in the security community. Vicente Aguilera Díaz’s work [1]

is well-known and some related previous researches are found in WASC’s page [2].

Mitsui  Bussan  Secure  Directions,  Inc.  (MBSD)  has  conducted  a  research  on  this  topic,

specifically  on  attack  techniques  utilizing  crafted  recipient  email  addresses.  The  basic

concept of this type of attack is mentioned in Insomnia’s slides [3] and possibly others. Our

research result described in this paper tries to further the attack possibility of the type and

show some attack examples.

This  paper  first  describes  the  attack  mechanism  and  then  explains  some  vulnerability

examples  in  email  libraries  on  Java,  Ruby,  PHP  and  other  platforms.  Other  attack

techniques and countermeasures are discussed in the following chapters.

Commands from client to server are indicated in red.

In theory every command in red can be used for an attack, but the research focused on "RCPT

TO"  command  (#8),  as  it  appeared  to  be  a  fruitful  target  and  the  exploitation  of  this

command did not seem to have been covered by the researches in the past (but later we come

to know it was mentioned by aforementioned paper [3] though).

Now, let’s see how the attack works. Suppose an attacker fully controls the recipient address.

In this scenario, an attacker provides a vector like the following.

Normal value:

rcpt=to@example.jp

Manipulated:

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

The resulting SMTP transaction is shown below:

; response to 8.5

Although  the  injected  commands  above  (#8.2  to  8.5)  are  sent  without  waiting  for  the

response to the previous command, all the MTAs we tested, which were Postfix, Sendmail

and MS Exchange, accepted the injected commands accordingly. This happens because the

SMTP’s  pipelining  extension  [4],  which  allows  batch  commands,  is  enabled  by  default  on

most MTAs including the aforementioned three.

This way, the attacker-injected message in the recipient address is processed by the server.

This type of vulnerability can be real threats in inquiry forms, member signup forms, or any

other application that delivers an email to a user-specified email address.

One thing worth mentioning here is that the traditional attack vectors like the following do

not work in the context of SMTP Injection.

to@example.jp[CRLF]Cc: x@example.org

This is why we believe this recipient attack is especially worth discussing.

3.  Vulnerability examples

This  chapter  describes  the  newly  discovered  vulnerabilities  in  email  libraries.  The

vulnerabilities have already been fixed in the latest versions of the programs.

3.1.  Ruby’s Mail

The  Ruby’s  "Mail"  [5]  is  an  email  library  used  in  Ruby  on  Rails  framework  (ActionMailer)

and other Ruby applications.

Mail  <=  v2.5.3  is  confirmed  to  be  prone  to  the  recipient  attack  as  it  does  not  validate  nor

sanitize given recipient addresses. Thus, the attacks described in chapter 2 can be applied to

the library without any modification.

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

The Mail library itself does not impose a length limit on email addresses, so an attacker can

send a long spam message via a recipient address unless there is a limit on the application’s

side.

This  vulnerability  affects  only  the  applications  that  lack  input  validation.  Upgrading  is

recommended, as Mail v2.6.0 and above are not affected by this attack.

Because  the  unsusceptible  versions  (v2.6.0  or  above)  are  released  relatively  recently,

specifically after June 2014, there must be more than a few online applications relying on

vulnerable versions of Mail (<= v.2.5.3).

3.2.  JavaMail

JavaMail is a widely used email library for Java applications provided by Oracle [6]. It is an

API in a narrow sense, but the vendor provides a reference implementation, which we call

"JavaMail" in this paper.

Our research discovered a vulnerability in JavaMail library. In the JavaMail’s case, as the

library validates given recipient addresses in a certain way, an attacker needs to bypass the

validation using an address with a crafted quoted-string part like the one shown below.

rcpt=">[CRLF]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT
[CRLF]"@mbsd.jp

The resulting SMTP transaction is as follows:

250 2.1.5 Ok↵

354 Please start mail input.↵
250 Mail queued for delivery.↵

; response to 8.2

; response to 8.3
; response to 8.5

As you can see above, JavaMail sends RSET and QUIT (#10, 12) to terminate the session after

receiving  an  error  (#9)  in  response  to  a  bad  RCPT TO  address  (#8.1).  Nevertheless,  the

attacker-injected  email  message  is  delivered  to  the  victim’s  mailbox,  only  because  MTAs

simply process given commands sequentially from top to bottom.

Like  Ruby’s  Mail,  JavaMail  itself  does  not  have  a  length  limit  on  email  addresses,  so  a

longer message can be sent via a long recipient address.

MBSD reported this bug to Oracle in October 2015. The vendor responded promptly and the

fix was pushed into 1.5.5-SNAPSHOT of their source code repository [7] within a week. The

vendor’s  prompt  reaction  was  somewhat  surprising  because  the  library’s  Mail  Header

Injection bug [8], reported by Alexandre Herzog of Compass Security in January 2014, was,

and still is, left unfixed.

In any case, upgrading to the latest snapshot version [9] or implementing validation on your

application’s  side  is  recommended,  if  you  are  aware  that  your  application’s  validation  is

poorly implemented.

Note  that  this  attack  succeeds  only  if  the  application  lacks  proper  input  validation.  The

vendor,  in  response  to  our  report,  suggested  the  necessity  of  input  validation  on  the

application’s  side  before  passing  this  sort  of  data  to  the  library  because  the  library’s

validation method for email addresses might not catch all possible errors.

3.3.  PHPMailer

PHPMailer is an email sending library for PHP [10].What is unique to this library is that it

tries to validate given recipient addresses strictly according to RFC 5322 [11] by applying an

incredibly complicated regex filter to the addresses:

 '|[1-9]?[0-9])(?>\.(?9)){3}))\])(?1)$/isD',
 $address
);

Therefore, an attacker must provide an RFC-5322-compliant address to perform the attack,

which is a hurdle difficult but not impossible to overcome in certain circumstances.

The following is a vector we created to evade the filter.

rcpt=([CRLF][SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF][SP]DATA \[LF]Subject: spam10\[LF][CRLF][SP]
Hello, this is a spam mail...\[LF].[CRLF][SP]QUIT[CRLF][SP]) a@mbsd.jp

You can find two forms of line-breaks in the vector.

One form is "[CRLF][SP]", which is called FWS (Folding White Space) in RFC 5322 and its

older equivalences. As its name suggests, it is an expression just to fold a line.

The other form of line-breaks is "\[LF]", which is called obs-qp in the same RFC. Although

this  is  an obsolete expression as the prefix indicates, a few libraries including PHPMailer

still allow its occurrence in email addresses.

The resulting SMTP transaction of the vector is shown below:

8.1:

8.6:

The transaction above is “irregular” for two reasons. One is that it contains commands led

by  a  space  such  as  "[SP]RCPT TO"  in  #8.2,  and  the  other  is  that  it  contains  a  command

MBSD Technical Whitepaper  ©2015 Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. All rights reserved.

followed by a backslash that is "[SP]DATA \" in #8.3.

The former command with a leading space is confirmed to be interpreted normally on Postfix

and Sendmail, and the latter command followed by backslash on Sendmail as well. Putting

them  together,  this  specific  vector  works  on  Sendmail  (it  works  on  Postfix  with  a  slight

modification,  though),  and  consequently  the  attacker-injected  email  is  delivered  to  the

victim’s mailbox.

Note that, in general, when MTAs relay the email to the next server, the garbage parts such

as leading spaces and following backslashes are removed. Thus, the restriction on the MTA

product type is applied only to the one the SMTP client library directly speaks to.

MBSD  reported  this  bug  to  the  vendor,  Synchromedia  in  November  2015.  The  vendor

released a fixed version (v5.2.14) within a couple of days after being notified. Upgrading to

the latest version like other products already mentioned is recommended.

In  this  attack,  some  MTAs,  namely  Sendmail  and  Postfix  can  also  be  said  excessively

permissive or even incompliant to the standard. However, we think the fault is more on the

SMTP client’s side, which sends illegal and misleading commands to the MTA, than on the

MTA’s side.

What should be emphasized here again is that the occurrence of line-break is compliant to

RFC  5322  as  long  as  it  constitutes  an  FWS  or  obs-qp.  FWS  and  obs-qp  can  appear  in  the

comment,  quoted-string  and  some  other  parts  in  an  email  address.  Meanwhile  the  SMTP

standard RFC 5321 [12] does not allow line-break occurrences at all.

For clarification, the key differences between the two RFC’s are shown in the table below:

RFC 5321

RFC 5322

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Internet Message Format

Spec scope

SMTP, envelope of mail object

Content of mail object

Context of
email addresses

SMTP commands,
MAIL FROM and RCPT TO

Content headers,
From, To and so on

Line-breaks in
email addresses

Not allowed

Allowed in
- FWS (Folding White Space)
- obs-qp (obsolete syntax)

In  essence,  email  addresses  passed  to  SMTP  commands  should  be  validated  as  per  RFC

5321, but not RFC 5322. However, as seen in the PHPMailer’s bug, confusion between the

two RFCs is often seen in SMTP client libraries.

Such confusion is further discussed in the next chapter.

3.4.  Other platforms

The libraries mentioned in this chapter, which are Ruby’s Mail, JavaMail and PHPMailer,

are not the only ones affected by the recipient attack.

In  our  penetration  testing  in  the  last  few  years,  MBSD  found  two  other  web  applications

using PHP and CGI (the programing language is unknown) that were vulnerable to the most

basic form of the recipient attack described in chapter 2.

We are not  certain which libraries were exactly in use in these vulnerable applications  as

they  were  discovered  during  our  black-box  tests.  We  assume  they  were  using  in-house

custom libraries or minor ones; because we found that many major email libraries at least

attempt to validate email addresses in some way or another, even though the validation may

be flawed as proven in this chapter.

In  any  case,  considering  the  possibility  of  applications’  using  poorly  written  libraries,

security  test  of  this  type  is  worth  performing  regardless  of  the  platform  in  which  the

applications run.

4.  Further attack possibility

In  this  chapter,  some  miscellaneous  topics  furthering  the  recipient  attack  are  discussed.

Note that the techniques or ideas described here are mostly theoretical and have not been

confirmed to work effectively on real environments.

4.1.  FWS Attack

As described in section 3.3, email addresses compliant to RFC 5322 may contain two types of

line-breaks,  which  are  obs-qp  and  FWS.  Obs-qp  is  rarely  accepted  by  the  email  libraries,

while FWS is more often accepted. Therefore, this section discusses attacks using only FWS.

The first attack target is "SmtpClient" class of ASP.NET v4.0.30319, the latest version as of

this  writing.  This  is  a  built-in  class  commonly  used  for  SMTP  email  delivery  purposes

in .NET applications [13].

Let’s look at the attack vector, which is an RFC-5322-compliant address containing FWS.

rcpt="xx[CRLF][SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF][SP]DATA[CRLF][SP]zz"@mbsd.jp

The resulting SMTP transaction is:

8.1:
8.2:
8.3:
8.4:
9:
10:
11:

RCPT TO:<"xx↵
[SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp↵
[SP]DATA↵
[SP]zz"@mbsd.jp>↵

501 5.1.3 Bad recipient address syntax↵
250 2.1.5 Ok↵
354 Please start mail input.↵

; response to 8.1
; response to 8.2
; response to 8.3

Leading spaces of the commands are simply ignored by Postfix and Sendmail, as explained

in the previous chapter. Thus the injected commands are interpreted by the server as you

can see above.

However, to only state the end result, we could not achieve a complete exploitation of this

bug  in  our  research.  The  reason  is  that  the  DATA  section  requires  "[CRLF].[CRLF]"  at  its

end, but such sequence is rejected by SmtpClient’s validation. Additionally, neither Postfix

nor Sendmail interprets "[CRLF][SP].[CRLF]" as the end of the section.

This means there is no way to end the DATA section in the attack using only FWS (recall that,

in the PHPMailer’s attack, we combined FWS and obs-qp to terminate DATA section).

Another  command  we  tried  was  "BDAT",  which  is  an  optional  SMTP  command  defined  in

MBSD Technical Whitepaper  ©2015 Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. All rights reserved.

9

RFC  3030  [14].  It  is  a  command  similar  to,  but  different  from  DATA  in  terms  of  BDAT  not

requiring a single period line at the end. However, the command seems to be supported only

by MS Exchange, which does not accept leading spaces.

Consequently, as long as the recent versions of the three major MTAs (Postfix, Sendmail and

MS  Exchange)  are  in  use,  this  SmtpClient’s  misbehavior  is  unlikely  to  be  exploitable  for

spamming  purposes.  Moreover,  we  are  not  presently  aware  of  other  MTAs  affected  by  the

bug.

The  behavior  is  not  specific  to  SmtpClient  class  of  .NET.  The  same  behavior  is  seen  in

Sendmail  command  (v8.15.2,  when  a  recipient  address  is  given  from  a  command  line

argument)  and  Swift  Mailer  (v5.4.1,  a  PHP’s  mail  library).  They  pass  a  supplied

RFC-5322-compliant  address  to  an  SMTP’s  "RCPT TO"  command  just  as  it  is,  even  if  the

address  contains  FWS.  But  their  bug  is  unlikely  to  be  exploitable  just  like  that  of

SmtpClient.

In  any  event,  what  these  libraries  are  expected  to  do  in  the  first  place  is  to  normalize  an

email  address  by  replacing  each  FWS  occurrence  with  SP  or  to  validate  an  email  address

passed to SMTP commands according to RFC 5321, not RFC 5322.

4.2.  CRLF-less attack

One of the author’s co-workers, Toshitsugu Yoneyama discovered an interesting behavior of

older versions of Postfix.

He found that when an overlong command is given, Postfix splits the command string into

chunks at most 2048 bytes long and then processes each chunk as an individual command in

order. This suggests a possibility of CRLF-less SMTP Injection attack specific to Postfix.

The following figure illustrates this attack idea.

However,  it  turned  out  that  this  idea  cannot  be  used  for  spamming  attack  because  of  the

"[CRLF].[CRLF]" hurdle, which is exactly what confronted us in the FWS attack described

in the previous section.

10

RCPT TO:<"␣␣(SP padding)…RCPT TO:a@example.jp␣␣…DATA␣␣…2048bytes2048bytesLong email address input

We tried to combine this splitting behavior with FWS attack, but  what was possible in the

end  was  sending  an  email  with  a  blank  content,  which  is  quite  useless  from  a  spammer's

perspective.

This is because the splitting does not occur in the message content  inside the DATA section.

Then, ".[CRLF][SP]" has to be placed immediately after the DATA command with trailing

spaces in order to terminate the DATA section gracefully.

This Postfix’s behavior cannot be reproduced in newer versions. For instance,  it cannot be

reproduced in v2.10.1 (the latest version in the official RPM packages for CentOS 7.x), while

it  can  be  in  v2.6.6  (that  for  CentOS  6.x).  This  indicates  a  certain  change  was  made

somewhere  between  the  two  versions,  presumably  in  v2.9.0,  which  introduced  a  flag

(SMTP_GET_FLAG_SKIP) to skip the overlong part of the command.

The countermeasure of this attack is restricting the length of email addresses according to

section 4.5.3 of RFC 5321 [15] or upgrading Postfix.

4.3.  Line-breaks for SMTP servers

RFC  5321  clearly  states  that  only  CRLF  is  the  SMTP’s  command  line  separator.  In  other

words, neither single LF nor CR should occur in the command line. They should also not be

interpreted as a separator by command recipient.

During the research, none of the three MTAs we tested (Postfix,  Sendmail  and Exchange)

was  found  to  treat  single  CR  as  a  separator.  Neither  was  VT  (Vertical  Tab,  0x0B)  nor  FF

(Form  Feed,  0x0C).  However,  Postfix  and  Sendmail  were  confirmed  to  treat  LF  as  a

separator against the RFC text, whereas MS Exchange complies with the text.

This  incompliance  of  Postfix  and  Sendmail  may  result  in  a  vulnerability  if  both  the

application and SMTP client library handle only CRLF properly. However, we could not find

any realistic example that this incompliance leads to a vulnerability because many libraries

that properly handle CRLF seem to do the same for single LF, too.

␣␣…DATA␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣….[CRLF]␣QUIT[CRLF]␣2048bytesLong email address input

5.  Sender address attack

Although this paper focuses on the recipient email addresses, the sender address in "MAIL

FROM" command can obviously be another injection target as well.

When  performing  a  test  targeting  a  sender  address,  all  of  the  essential  SMTP  commands

must appear in order and without omission in the resulting SMTP transaction.

This means attack vectors need a modification.

Vector for recipient
rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

Vector for sender
sndr=from@example.jp>[CRLF]RCPT TO:attacker@example.org[CRLF]DATA[CRLF]

The latter vector is intended to replace the original recipient address with the attacker’s by

supplying a crafted sender address.

The resulting SMTP transaction is shown below:

6.1:
6.2:
6.3:
6.4:
7:
8:
9:
10:
11:
12:
13:

16:

MAIL FROM:<from@example.com>↵
RCPT TO:attacker@example.org↵
DATA↵

250 2.1.0 Ok↵
250 2.1.0 Ok↵
354 Please start mail input.↵
RCPT TO:<original recipient address>↵

; response to 6.1
; response to 6.2
; response to 6.3

QUIT↵

250 Mail queued for delivery.↵

; response to 13

221 Closing connection. Good bye.↵

; response to 15

As  the  result,  only  by  manipulating  the  sender  address,  the  attacker  receives  an  email

message containing the original confidential message content:

>
RCPT TO:<original recipient address>
DATA
(original confidential message content)

; input 6.4
; input 10
; input 11
; input 12

Of course, the attacker can also utilize this bug for spamming just by appending a string like

"(spam content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]" at the end of the vector.

6.  Conclusion

This  paper  explained  how  the  SMTP  Injection  attack  through  a  crafted  recipient  email

address  works  and  showed  the  examples  of  vulnerable  SMTP  clients  and  the  possible

further attacks.

The countermeasure of this attack is to ensure that the email address being passed to "RCPT

TO" command is compliant to RFC 5321 in terms of syntax and length. The syntax rule is

defined in section 4.1.2 of the RFC, and  the length limit  is in  section  4.5.3.1.  Of course,  a

little more relaxed rule can be an option, as a small proportion of existing and actually used

addresses is known to be incompliant to the standard. Needless to say, when a relaxed rule

is employed, addresses containing line-breaks must not be allowed.

Note that, regarding the valid email address format, confusion between RFC 5321 and 5322

is sometimes seen; however, RFC 5321 should be referred in the context of SMTP.

At  MBSD  we  think  modern  SMTP  client  libraries  should  desirably  be  equipped  with  this

sort of validation mechanism, but it is not to say that the web application developers must

not perform the validation on their own. Whatever the case may be, an application is safe as

long as either the library or the application itself performs proper validation.

If  you  need  to  verify  whether  or  not  your  application  is  susceptible  to  the  attack  in  a

black-box manner, consider using the vector below (the most basic one):

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

More advanced and somewhat library-specific vectors are shown in chapter 3.

If the application accepts a sender email address as an input, the vectors mentioned above

need a slight adjustment as described in chapter 5.

From: Reed Loden <reed@...dloden.com>

	Assign a CVE Identifier <cve-assign@...re.org>
Subject: CVE request: mail ruby gem <2.6.0 vulnerable to SMTP injection via
 recipient email addresses

Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.) released a
whitepaper entitled "SMTP Injection via recipient email addresses" (
<http://www.mbsd.jp/Whitepaper/smtpi.pdf>). This whitepaper has a section
discussing how one such vulnerability affected the 'mail' ruby gem (see
section 3.1).

Whitepaper has all the specific details, but basically the 'mail' ruby gem
module is prone to the recipient attack as it does not validate nor
sanitize given recipient addresses. Thus, the attacks described in chapter
2 of the whitepaper can be applied to the gem without any modification. The
'mail' ruby gem itself does not impose a length limit on email addresses,
so an attacker can send a long spam message via a recipient address unless
there is a limit on the application's side. This vulnerability affects only
the applications that lack input validation.

'mail' is a "A Really Ruby Mail Library" for Ruby.

Ruby gem: mail (<https://rubygems.org/gems/mail>)
Affects: 2.5.4 and earlier
Fixed in: 2.6.0
Fixed by
<https://github.com/mikel/mail/commit/72befdc4dab3e6e288ce226a7da2aa474cf5be83>

Can a CVE be assigned? Since the issue was fixed in 2013, not sure if that
means it needs a 2013 era CVE or if a 2015 one will work since it wasn't
found to be a vulnerability until this year.

Note, the paper author has informed me "BTW, while investigating the source
code of Mail, I came to think the fault might be more on Net::SMTP's side.
It is difficult to say who is responsible for it, Net::SMTP, Mail or
application developers (library users) though."

Either way, vuln needs to be tracked, and a change in 'mail' did mitigate
it for now (and affects all their delivery methods, not just 'smtp').

Thanks,
~reed
