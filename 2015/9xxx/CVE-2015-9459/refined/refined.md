Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `searchterms-tagging-2` plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `count` parameter is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries, and also rendered unsanitized into the HTML output, leading to both SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Blind SQL Injection:** Multiple functions in the plugin, such as `pk_stt2_db_get_popular_terms`, `pk_stt2_db_get_search_terms`, `pk_stt2_db_get_recent_terms`, `pk_stt2_db_get_random_terms`, `pk_stt2_db_get_home_keywords`, `pk_stt2_db_get_popular_tag`, `pk_stt2_db_get_last_promoted_post_title`, and `pk_stt2_db_get_posts_wo_traffic` are vulnerable. The `count` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The same `count` parameter is also vulnerable to XSS. User-supplied values are not properly sanitized before being displayed in the administrative interface, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed within the browser of an administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could read sensitive data from the database (including user credentials, post content, etc.)
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the server by exploiting database-specific vulnerabilities.
2.  **XSS:**
    *   An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of the administratorâ€™s browser.
    *   This could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, and other malicious activities within the administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/options-general.php`).
*   The `page` parameter must be set to `searchterms-tagging2.php`.
*   The `stats` parameter must be set to `1`.
*   The vulnerable `count` parameter must be set to a malicious payload, such as an SQL injection or JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress administrator or have credentials of an admin user.
*   The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the target WordPress instance.
*  No CSRF protection exists, so an attacker could potentially craft a link that, when clicked by an admin user, will execute the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

* The plugin is no longer available for download and has been closed by WordPress.org.
* The plugin version affected is 1.535.
* The provided email also includes examples of how to trigger both the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
* The email indicates that CSRF protection is missing which can further facilitate exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
