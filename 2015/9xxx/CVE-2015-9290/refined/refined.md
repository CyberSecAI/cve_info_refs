Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9290:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a buffer over-read in the Type 1 font parser of the FreeType library. Specifically, the issue occurs within the `T1_Get_Private_Dict` function in `src/type1/t1parse.c`.
- The code did not properly check if the current position (`cur`) was within the bounds of the file buffer when parsing the private dictionary of a Type 1 font. This could lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Over-read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient checks on the buffer boundaries during Type 1 font parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The provided information shows that an AddressSanitizer detected a global-buffer-overflow, which indicates that the application could crash.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to application crashes. While the information doesn't provide details about arbitrary code execution, buffer over-reads can sometimes be leveraged for more severe impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted Type 1 font file that is processed by the FreeType library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted Type 1 font file to an application using the vulnerable FreeType library. This could be achieved via:
    - A website that displays fonts using FreeType.
    - An application that loads user-provided fonts (e.g., a word processor or image viewer).
    - Any process that uses the FreeType library to handle type 1 fonts.

**More Details:**

- The provided patch in `t1parse.c` addresses the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that `cur` does not go beyond the end of the buffer `limit`.
- The fix is described as making checks "more sensible" which implies that the checks were missing or incorrectly implemented before.
- A specific example with a provided font file is given as a trigger.
- The bug report mentions that this vulnerability was found using libFuzzer and AddressSanitizer, tools used for automated vulnerability discovery.

The fix involves adding the following lines to `t1parse.c` in the `T1_Get_Private_Dict` function:

```c
  if ( cur >= limit )
  {
    FT_ERROR(( "T1_Get_Private_Dict:"+ " premature end in private dictionary\n" ));
    error = FT_THROW( Invalid_File_Format );
    goto Exit;
  }
```
This ensures that a check is performed to avoid reading beyond the end of the buffer.
