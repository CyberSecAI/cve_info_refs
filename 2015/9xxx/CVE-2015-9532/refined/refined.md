The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads (EDD). It indicates a vulnerability related to the usage of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions, specifically when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` with an unescaped or untrusted URL as the third parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization of URLs passed to `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`. This can lead to an open redirect vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when processed by the vulnerable code, redirects users to a site of the attacker's choosing.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to somehow inject a malicious URL into the third parameter of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` calls. This could be done by manipulating a user-controllable input that is later used in one of these functions without proper sanitization.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have a way to influence the URL passed as the third parameter. This typically involves finding an entry point where unsanitized user input or external data is used within these functions.
