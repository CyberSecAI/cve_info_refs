Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin where the 3rd parameter (a URL) is not properly escaped. Specifically, if an untrusted or unescaped URL is passed as the third argument to these functions, it can lead to a security issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unescaped URL:** The core vulnerability lies in the failure to sanitize or escape user-provided or otherwise untrusted URLs before passing them to `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.
- **URL Manipulation:** By controlling the unescaped URL, an attacker can manipulate the query parameters of the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary URL redirection:** An attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious websites by crafting a URL with a malicious query string and using the vulnerability.
- **Phishing:** Redirecting to a malicious website could be used to trick users into providing sensitive information.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly stated, it's possible that a crafted URL could inject malicious script if the target system processes the URL without proper sanitization

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL construction:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the aim of exploiting the lack of escaping in `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs a victim to click the crafted URL. This could happen through social engineering, for example, sending a link via email or posting on a forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL with specific query parameters designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link or otherwise using the manipulated URL in the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The comments in the blog post confirm that not all instances of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` are vulnerable, only the ones where the 3rd parameter is an unescaped/untrusted URL.
- The blog post also implies that the fix was automatically deployed to users who had enabled automatic updates.
