Appears to be no longer maintained and accordions are now broken on latest WP.
This was a great plugin, hope somebody will fix it soon!

I used to be a huge fan of the Easy Bootstrap Shortcodes plugin. But, that plugin forced my footer to have what looks like white sidebars for some odd reason. Then I found this plugin and fell in love. This plugin does everything! I mean this literally! It is in my hope that we see many new updates to this plugin, as this is one of the best plugins for shortcodes out there! AWESOME PLUGIN!
