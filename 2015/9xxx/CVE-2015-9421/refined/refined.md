Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Olevmedia Shortcodes plugin (version 1.1.8) is vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The plugin's `omsc_popup` AJAX action takes user-supplied input via the `id` parameter and echoes it back into the HTML output without proper sanitization.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability exists in a POST request, and there is no CSRF protection, making it possible for an attacker to trick a user into submitting the malicious request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code into the vulnerable page.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    *   Phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website by modifying its content.
    *   Malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=omsc_popup`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id` within the POST data.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code as the value of the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, including POST requests.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges.  Authenticated users like subscribers can perform the attack.
* The attacker can also potentially leverage CSRF techniques to trigger the exploit from another website.
