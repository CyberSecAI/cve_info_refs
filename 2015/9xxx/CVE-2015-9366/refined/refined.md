The provided content is related to CVE-2015-9366.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the misuse of the `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions in WordPress plugins. Developers incorrectly assumed that these functions would automatically escape user input, which they do not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user input when constructing URLs.
- Lack of input sanitization and output encoding when using `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the query parameters of a URL.
- This malicious script can be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
- The attacker can potentially steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting malicious URLs with specially crafted query parameters.
- Tricking a user into clicking on the malicious link or embedding it into a website.
- Exploiting user interaction with vulnerable WordPress plugins using these functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious URL with crafted query parameters.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to access the crafted URL.
- No specific position is required, as the attack relies on a user visiting the malicious URL via a website or social engineering.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was widespread, affecting many popular WordPress plugins such as Jetpack, WordPress SEO, Google Analytics by Yoast, All In One SEO, Gravity Forms, UpdraftPlus, and many others.
- The issue was discovered by Joost from Yoast.
- The WordPress core security team, along with plugin developers, collaborated to release patches for the vulnerable plugins.
- The official WordPress documentation (Codex) for these functions was initially unclear, leading to the widespread vulnerability, however, the documentation has since been updated.
- The recommended fix is to use the `esc_url()` or `esc_url_raw()` functions to properly escape the output of `add_query_arg()` and `remove_query_arg()` before using the output to construct URLs.
- The article also advises developers to not assume that `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` will automatically escape user input and should always escape before using in the URL
