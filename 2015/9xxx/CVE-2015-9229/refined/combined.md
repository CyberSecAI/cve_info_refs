Homepage: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/download/>

Compatible Up to Wordpress 4.3.0 Version (Requires: 3.6.1 or higher)

Severity High

Status: Not Fixed

Exploitation Requires Authentication?: yes

Vulnerable URL: <http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nggallery-manage-gallery&mode=edit&gid=1&paged=1/>

Vulnerable Variable:  **images[1][alttext] & path**

POC URL: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYpOdlehFfo>

# Description

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WordPress plugin Gravity Forms. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies. This means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

Visit the following page on a site with this plugin installed. <http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nggallery-manage-gallery&mode=edit&gid=1&paged=1> and modify the value of **images[1][alttext]** and **path** variable in NextGEN Gallery Photocrati Version 2.1.10 with `’)”></script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>` payload and save it to view further.

Now, the added XSS payload will be executed whenever the user reviews it.

**Note:** XSS payload has been tried with the application once after implementing Unfiltered Html Settings as defined to wp-config.php file.

***define( 'DISALLOW\_UNFILTERED\_HTML', true );***

**Issue 1:**

POST request parameter **images[1][alttext]** variable in the given URL <http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nggallery-manage-gallery&mode=edit&gid=1&paged=1> of NextGEN Gallery Plugin version 2.1.10 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
