Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2015-9229:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress, specifically in the handling of the `images[1][alttext]` and `path` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `images[1][alttext]` and `path` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal session cookies by injecting malicious JavaScript.
- **Account Takeover:** By gaining control of a user's session, the attacker can change the user's password, effectively taking over their account.
- **Malicious Actions:** Once the attacker has gained access to a session, the user could execute arbitrary actions on the website, or change the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by injecting the malicious code using the vulnerable parameters. This can be accomplished by a crafted URL.
- The attacker needs to entice an administrator to visit the crafted URL.
- The injected JavaScript payload executes in the browser when the administrator visits the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL with the crafted javascript payload in the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker needs to have the crafted URL visited by a logged-in administrator of the WordPress website.
- The targeted WordPress installation needs to be running a vulnerable version of the NextGEN Gallery plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported multiple times across different versions of the NextGEN Gallery plugin (2.1.7, 2.1.10, and 2.1.15).
- The vulnerability exists even when the `DISALLOW_UNFILTERED_HTML` setting is enabled in the `wp-config.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameters are accessed via the admin interface at the URL: `http://yourwordpresssite.com/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nggallery-manage-gallery&mode=edit&gid=1&paged=1`
- The payload `’)”></script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>` is used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
