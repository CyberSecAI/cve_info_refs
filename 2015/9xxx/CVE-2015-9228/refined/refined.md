Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2015-9228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress. The plugin does not properly validate the file type and contents during the upload process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows users to upload files without proper validation of their type or content.
- **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The plugin doesn't properly check the file extension, allowing an attacker to change the extension of an uploaded file (e.g., from .jpg to .php).
- **Insecure File Handling:** The plugin stores uploaded files in a publicly accessible directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a file with a .php extension containing malicious PHP code (a web shell), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Full Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the web server and all its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Feature:** The vulnerability is exploited through the file upload feature of the NextGEN Gallery plugin.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker uses a crafted HTTP POST request to upload a malicious file.
- **File and Name Variable Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the 'name' variable to change the extension to '.php' and injects PHP code into the 'file' variable, which is supposed to contain the image data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress admin panel, as the file upload option is available through the products section of the plugin.
- **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP POST request used for the file upload, allowing them to change the file extension and inject malicious code.
- **Knowledge of WordPress and Plugin:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of WordPress and the NextGEN Gallery plugin in order to locate the vulnerable upload functionality.

**Technical Details:**
The provided technical details show how an attacker can:
1.  Log in to a WordPress application with the vulnerable NextGEN Gallery plugin installed.
2.  Navigate to the file upload option within the plugin's product section.
3.  Initiate a file upload (e.g., a JPG file).
4.  Intercept the upload request and modify the 'name' variable to change the file extension to PHP and add malicious code to the 'file' variable.
5.  Submit the modified request, resulting in a PHP file containing malicious code being uploaded to the server.
6.  Access the uploaded PHP file via a publicly available URL to execute the injected code.
