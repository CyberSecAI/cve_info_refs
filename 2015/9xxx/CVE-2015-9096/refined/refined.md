Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9096:

**CVE-2015-9096:**  SMTP command injection in Net::SMTP.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `Net::SMTP` module when handling recipient addresses or sender addresses. Specifically, the module doesn't prevent the inclusion of Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters within these addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SMTP Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to SMTP injection attacks. By including CR and LF characters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SMTP commands within the recipient or sender address fields, leading to unauthorized actions on the SMTP server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `Net::SMTP` module in vulnerable versions does not validate or sanitize recipient/sender addresses to prevent the inclusion of CR or LF.
- **RFC Compliance Violation:**  The vulnerability arises from the module not adhering to RFC 5321, which prohibits line breaks in email addresses used in SMTP commands, while incorrectly allowing elements from RFC5322 to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spamming:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to send spam emails using the vulnerable application's SMTP server.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Though not explicitly stated in the provided text, SMTP injection can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary command execution on the mail server itself, especially if other systems interact with the mail server in an insecure manner.
- **Information Disclosure:** By manipulating the sender address, an attacker could potentially intercept emails or gain access to information intended for other recipients.
- **Message Manipulation:** Attackers can inject custom email headers and message content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Recipient Address:** The attacker injects malicious SMTP commands into the recipient address. For example, `rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]`.
- **Manipulated Sender Address:** The attacker injects malicious SMTP commands into the sender address. For example, `sndr=from@example.jp>[CRLF]RCPT TO:attacker@example.org[CRLF]DATA[CRLF]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Recipient or Sender Address Input:** The attacker needs to have control over the input field that is used to specify the recipient or sender email address within the vulnerable application. This is often the case in web forms or user input fields.
- **Network Access:** The attacker typically needs network access to interact with the vulnerable application and, consequently, the SMTP server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Ruby's "Mail" library (versions <= 2.5.3).
- The issue is described in a MBSD technical whitepaper, which provides a deep dive into the attack vector, discussing the difference between RFC5321 and RFC5322, and the implications.
- The vulnerability is also present in other libraries, like JavaMail, and PHPMailer (though it required a more complex attack vector).
- The fix implemented in `ruby/ruby` was to raise an ArgumentError when CR or LF is present in the line, in `lib/net/smtp.rb`, to prevent this kind of injection.
- Debian addressed this vulnerability in ruby2.3 (DSA 3966-1) and ruby2.1 (DLA 1421-1) by upgrading the packages.
