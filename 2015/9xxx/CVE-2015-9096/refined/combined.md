1.  Introduction

SMTP Injection is an attack technique that injects attacker-controlled SMTP commands into

the data transmitted from an application (typically a web application) to an SMTP server for

spamming purposes.

Among this class of attack, techniques using manipulated content (message body or header)

have been published and known in the security community. Vicente Aguilera Díaz’s work [1]

is well-known and some related previous researches are found in WASC’s page [2].

Mitsui  Bussan  Secure  Directions,  Inc.  (MBSD)  has  conducted  a  research  on  this  topic,

specifically  on  attack  techniques  utilizing  crafted  recipient  email  addresses.  The  basic

concept of this type of attack is mentioned in Insomnia’s slides [3] and possibly others. Our

research result described in this paper tries to further the attack possibility of the type and

show some attack examples.

This  paper  first  describes  the  attack  mechanism  and  then  explains  some  vulnerability

examples  in  email  libraries  on  Java,  Ruby,  PHP  and  other  platforms.  Other  attack

techniques and countermeasures are discussed in the following chapters.

Commands from client to server are indicated in red.

In theory every command in red can be used for an attack, but the research focused on "RCPT

TO"  command  (#8),  as  it  appeared  to  be  a  fruitful  target  and  the  exploitation  of  this

command did not seem to have been covered by the researches in the past (but later we come

to know it was mentioned by aforementioned paper [3] though).

Now, let’s see how the attack works. Suppose an attacker fully controls the recipient address.

In this scenario, an attacker provides a vector like the following.

Normal value:

rcpt=to@example.jp

Manipulated:

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

The resulting SMTP transaction is shown below:

; response to 8.1
; response to 8.2
; response to 8.4
; response to 8.5

Although  the  injected  commands  above  (#8.2  to  8.5)  are  sent  without  waiting  for  the

response to the previous command, all the MTAs we tested, which were Postfix, Sendmail

and MS Exchange, accepted the injected commands accordingly. This happens because the

SMTP’s  pipelining  extension  [4],  which  allows  batch  commands,  is  enabled  by  default  on

most MTAs including the aforementioned three.

This way, the attacker-injected message in the recipient address is processed by the server.

This type of vulnerability can be real threats in inquiry forms, member signup forms, or any

other application that delivers an email to a user-specified email address.

One thing worth mentioning here is that the traditional attack vectors like the following do

not work in the context of SMTP Injection.

to@example.jp[CRLF]Cc: x@example.org

This is why we believe this recipient attack is especially worth discussing.

3.  Vulnerability examples

This  chapter  describes  the  newly  discovered  vulnerabilities  in  email  libraries.  The

vulnerabilities have already been fixed in the latest versions of the programs.

3.1.  Ruby’s Mail

The  Ruby’s  "Mail"  [5]  is  an  email  library  used  in  Ruby  on  Rails  framework  (ActionMailer)

and other Ruby applications.

Mail  <=  v2.5.3  is  confirmed  to  be  prone  to  the  recipient  attack  as  it  does  not  validate  nor

sanitize given recipient addresses. Thus, the attacks described in chapter 2 can be applied to

the library without any modification.

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

The Mail library itself does not impose a length limit on email addresses, so an attacker can

send a long spam message via a recipient address unless there is a limit on the application’s

side.

This  vulnerability  affects  only  the  applications  that  lack  input  validation.  Upgrading  is

recommended, as Mail v2.6.0 and above are not affected by this attack.

Because  the  unsusceptible  versions  (v2.6.0  or  above)  are  released  relatively  recently,

specifically after June 2014, there must be more than a few online applications relying on

vulnerable versions of Mail (<= v.2.5.3).

3.2.  JavaMail

JavaMail is a widely used email library for Java applications provided by Oracle [6]. It is an

API in a narrow sense, but the vendor provides a reference implementation, which we call

"JavaMail" in this paper.

Our research discovered a vulnerability in JavaMail library. In the JavaMail’s case, as the

library validates given recipient addresses in a certain way, an attacker needs to bypass the

validation using an address with a crafted quoted-string part like the one shown below.

rcpt=">[CRLF]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT
[CRLF]"@mbsd.jp

The resulting SMTP transaction is as follows:

250 2.1.5 Ok↵

354 Please start mail input.↵
250 Mail queued for delivery.↵

; response to 8.2

; response to 8.3
; response to 8.5

As you can see above, JavaMail sends RSET and QUIT (#10, 12) to terminate the session after

receiving  an  error  (#9)  in  response  to  a  bad  RCPT TO  address  (#8.1).  Nevertheless,  the

attacker-injected  email  message  is  delivered  to  the  victim’s  mailbox,  only  because  MTAs

simply process given commands sequentially from top to bottom.

Like  Ruby’s  Mail,  JavaMail  itself  does  not  have  a  length  limit  on  email  addresses,  so  a

longer message can be sent via a long recipient address.

MBSD reported this bug to Oracle in October 2015. The vendor responded promptly and the

fix was pushed into 1.5.5-SNAPSHOT of their source code repository [7] within a week. The

vendor’s  prompt  reaction  was  somewhat  surprising  because  the  library’s  Mail  Header

Injection bug [8], reported by Alexandre Herzog of Compass Security in January 2014, was,

and still is, left unfixed.

In any case, upgrading to the latest snapshot version [9] or implementing validation on your

application’s  side  is  recommended,  if  you  are  aware  that  your  application’s  validation  is

poorly implemented.

Note  that  this  attack  succeeds  only  if  the  application  lacks  proper  input  validation.  The

vendor,  in  response  to  our  report,  suggested  the  necessity  of  input  validation  on  the

application’s  side  before  passing  this  sort  of  data  to  the  library  because  the  library’s

validation method for email addresses might not catch all possible errors.

3.3.  PHPMailer

PHPMailer is an email sending library for PHP [10].What is unique to this library is that it

tries to validate given recipient addresses strictly according to RFC 5322 [11] by applying an

incredibly complicated regex filter to the addresses:

MBSD Technical Whitepaper  ©2015 Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. All rights reserved.

preg_match(
 '/^(?!(?>(?1)"?(?>\\\[ -~]|[^"])"?(?1)){255,})(?!(?>(?1)"?(?>\\\[ -~]|[^"])"?(?1)){65,}@)' .
 '((?>(?>(?>((?>(?>(?>\x0D\x0A)?[\t ])+|(?>[\t ]*\x0D\x0A)?[\t ]+)?)(\((?>(?2)' .
 '(?>[\x01-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\'*-\[\]-\x7F]|\\\[\x00-\x7F]|(?3)))*(?2)\)))+(?2))|(?2))?)' .
 '([!#-\'*+\/-9=?^-~-]+|"(?>(?2)(?>[\x01-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-!#-\[\]-\x7F]|\\\[\x00-\x7F]))*' .
 '(?2)")(?>(?1)\.(?1)(?4))*(?1)@(?!(?1)[a-z0-9-]{64,})(?1)(?>([a-z0-9](?>[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?)' .
 '(?>(?1)\.(?!(?1)[a-z0-9-]{64,})(?1)(?5)){0,126}|\[(?:(?>IPv6:(?>([a-f0-9]{1,4})(?>:(?6)){7}' .
 '|(?!(?:.*[a-f0-9][:\]]){8,})((?6)(?>:(?6)){0,6})?::(?7)?))|(?>(?>IPv6:(?>(?6)(?>:(?6)){5}:' .
 '|(?!(?:.*[a-f0-9]:){6,})(?8)?::(?>((?6)(?>:(?6)){0,4}):)?))?(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}' .
 '|[1-9]?[0-9])(?>\.(?9)){3}))\])(?1)$/isD',
 $address
);

Therefore, an attacker must provide an RFC-5322-compliant address to perform the attack,

which is a hurdle difficult but not impossible to overcome in certain circumstances.

The following is a vector we created to evade the filter.

rcpt=([CRLF][SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF][SP]DATA \[LF]Subject: spam10\[LF][CRLF][SP]
Hello, this is a spam mail...\[LF].[CRLF][SP]QUIT[CRLF][SP]) a@mbsd.jp

You can find two forms of line-breaks in the vector.

One form is "[CRLF][SP]", which is called FWS (Folding White Space) in RFC 5322 and its

older equivalences. As its name suggests, it is an expression just to fold a line.

The other form of line-breaks is "\[LF]", which is called obs-qp in the same RFC. Although

this  is  an obsolete expression as the prefix indicates, a few libraries including PHPMailer

still allow its occurrence in email addresses.

The resulting SMTP transaction of the vector is shown below:

8.1:

8.5:
8.6:

250 2.0.0 xxx Message accepted for delivery↵

QUIT↵

The transaction above is “irregular” for two reasons. One is that it contains commands led

by  a  space  such  as  "[SP]RCPT TO"  in  #8.2,  and  the  other  is  that  it  contains  a  command

MBSD Technical Whitepaper  ©2015 Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. All rights reserved.

followed by a backslash that is "[SP]DATA \" in #8.3.

The former command with a leading space is confirmed to be interpreted normally on Postfix

and Sendmail, and the latter command followed by backslash on Sendmail as well. Putting

them  together,  this  specific  vector  works  on  Sendmail  (it  works  on  Postfix  with  a  slight

modification,  though),  and  consequently  the  attacker-injected  email  is  delivered  to  the

victim’s mailbox.

Note that, in general, when MTAs relay the email to the next server, the garbage parts such

as leading spaces and following backslashes are removed. Thus, the restriction on the MTA

product type is applied only to the one the SMTP client library directly speaks to.

MBSD  reported  this  bug  to  the  vendor,  Synchromedia  in  November  2015.  The  vendor

released a fixed version (v5.2.14) within a couple of days after being notified. Upgrading to

the latest version like other products already mentioned is recommended.

In  this  attack,  some  MTAs,  namely  Sendmail  and  Postfix  can  also  be  said  excessively

permissive or even incompliant to the standard. However, we think the fault is more on the

SMTP client’s side, which sends illegal and misleading commands to the MTA, than on the

MTA’s side.

What should be emphasized here again is that the occurrence of line-break is compliant to

RFC  5322  as  long  as  it  constitutes  an  FWS  or  obs-qp.  FWS  and  obs-qp  can  appear  in  the

comment,  quoted-string  and  some  other  parts  in  an  email  address.  Meanwhile  the  SMTP

standard RFC 5321 [12] does not allow line-break occurrences at all.

For clarification, the key differences between the two RFC’s are shown in the table below:

RFC 5321

RFC 5322

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Internet Message Format

Spec scope

SMTP, envelope of mail object

Content of mail object

Context of
email addresses

SMTP commands,
MAIL FROM and RCPT TO

Content headers,
From, To and so on

Line-breaks in
email addresses

Not allowed

Allowed in
- FWS (Folding White Space)
- obs-qp (obsolete syntax)

In  essence,  email  addresses  passed  to  SMTP  commands  should  be  validated  as  per  RFC

5321, but not RFC 5322. However, as seen in the PHPMailer’s bug, confusion between the

two RFCs is often seen in SMTP client libraries.

Such confusion is further discussed in the next chapter.

3.4.  Other platforms

The libraries mentioned in this chapter, which are Ruby’s Mail, JavaMail and PHPMailer,

are not the only ones affected by the recipient attack.

In  our  penetration  testing  in  the  last  few  years,  MBSD  found  two  other  web  applications

using PHP and CGI (the programing language is unknown) that were vulnerable to the most

basic form of the recipient attack described in chapter 2.

We are not  certain which libraries were exactly in use in these vulnerable applications  as

they  were  discovered  during  our  black-box  tests.  We  assume  they  were  using  in-house

custom libraries or minor ones; because we found that many major email libraries at least

attempt to validate email addresses in some way or another, even though the validation may

be flawed as proven in this chapter.

In  any  case,  considering  the  possibility  of  applications’  using  poorly  written  libraries,

security  test  of  this  type  is  worth  performing  regardless  of  the  platform  in  which  the

applications run.

4.  Further attack possibility

In  this  chapter,  some  miscellaneous  topics  furthering  the  recipient  attack  are  discussed.

Note that the techniques or ideas described here are mostly theoretical and have not been

confirmed to work effectively on real environments.

4.1.  FWS Attack

As described in section 3.3, email addresses compliant to RFC 5322 may contain two types of

line-breaks,  which  are  obs-qp  and  FWS.  Obs-qp  is  rarely  accepted  by  the  email  libraries,

while FWS is more often accepted. Therefore, this section discusses attacks using only FWS.

The first attack target is "SmtpClient" class of ASP.NET v4.0.30319, the latest version as of

this  writing.  This  is  a  built-in  class  commonly  used  for  SMTP  email  delivery  purposes

in .NET applications [13].

Let’s look at the attack vector, which is an RFC-5322-compliant address containing FWS.

rcpt="xx[CRLF][SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp[CRLF][SP]DATA[CRLF][SP]zz"@mbsd.jp

The resulting SMTP transaction is:

8.1:
8.2:
8.3:
8.4:
9:
10:
11:

RCPT TO:<"xx↵
[SP]RCPT TO:to@example.jp↵
[SP]DATA↵
[SP]zz"@mbsd.jp>↵

501 5.1.3 Bad recipient address syntax↵
250 2.1.5 Ok↵
354 Please start mail input.↵

; response to 8.1
; response to 8.2
; response to 8.3

Leading spaces of the commands are simply ignored by Postfix and Sendmail, as explained

in the previous chapter. Thus the injected commands are interpreted by the server as you

can see above.

However, to only state the end result, we could not achieve a complete exploitation of this

bug  in  our  research.  The  reason  is  that  the  DATA  section  requires  "[CRLF].[CRLF]"  at  its

end, but such sequence is rejected by SmtpClient’s validation. Additionally, neither Postfix

nor Sendmail interprets "[CRLF][SP].[CRLF]" as the end of the section.

This means there is no way to end the DATA section in the attack using only FWS (recall that,

in the PHPMailer’s attack, we combined FWS and obs-qp to terminate DATA section).

Another  command  we  tried  was  "BDAT",  which  is  an  optional  SMTP  command  defined  in

MBSD Technical Whitepaper  ©2015 Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. All rights reserved.

RFC  3030  [14].  It  is  a  command  similar  to,  but  different  from  DATA  in  terms  of  BDAT  not

requiring a single period line at the end. However, the command seems to be supported only

by MS Exchange, which does not accept leading spaces.

Consequently, as long as the recent versions of the three major MTAs (Postfix, Sendmail and

MS  Exchange)  are  in  use,  this  SmtpClient’s  misbehavior  is  unlikely  to  be  exploitable  for

spamming  purposes.  Moreover,  we  are  not  presently  aware  of  other  MTAs  affected  by  the

bug.

The  behavior  is  not  specific  to  SmtpClient  class  of  .NET.  The  same  behavior  is  seen  in

Sendmail  command  (v8.15.2,  when  a  recipient  address  is  given  from  a  command  line

argument)  and  Swift  Mailer  (v5.4.1,  a  PHP’s  mail  library).  They  pass  a  supplied

RFC-5322-compliant  address  to  an  SMTP’s  "RCPT TO"  command  just  as  it  is,  even  if  the

address  contains  FWS.  But  their  bug  is  unlikely  to  be  exploitable  just  like  that  of

SmtpClient.

In  any  event,  what  these  libraries  are  expected  to  do  in  the  first  place  is  to  normalize  an

email  address  by  replacing  each  FWS  occurrence  with  SP  or  to  validate  an  email  address

passed to SMTP commands according to RFC 5321, not RFC 5322.

4.2.  CRLF-less attack

One of the author’s co-workers, Toshitsugu Yoneyama discovered an interesting behavior of

older versions of Postfix.

He found that when an overlong command is given, Postfix splits the command string into

chunks at most 2048 bytes long and then processes each chunk as an individual command in

order. This suggests a possibility of CRLF-less SMTP Injection attack specific to Postfix.

The following figure illustrates this attack idea.

However,  it  turned  out  that  this  idea  cannot  be  used  for  spamming  attack  because  of  the

"[CRLF].[CRLF]" hurdle, which is exactly what confronted us in the FWS attack described

in the previous section.

10

RCPT TO:<"␣␣(SP padding)…RCPT TO:a@example.jp␣␣…DATA␣␣…2048bytes2048bytesLong email address input

We tried to combine this splitting behavior with FWS attack, but  what was possible in the

end  was  sending  an  email  with  a  blank  content,  which  is  quite  useless  from  a  spammer's

perspective.

This is because the splitting does not occur in the message content  inside the DATA section.

Then, ".[CRLF][SP]" has to be placed immediately after the DATA command with trailing

spaces in order to terminate the DATA section gracefully.

This Postfix’s behavior cannot be reproduced in newer versions. For instance,  it cannot be

reproduced in v2.10.1 (the latest version in the official RPM packages for CentOS 7.x), while

it  can  be  in  v2.6.6  (that  for  CentOS  6.x).  This  indicates  a  certain  change  was  made

somewhere  between  the  two  versions,  presumably  in  v2.9.0,  which  introduced  a  flag

(SMTP_GET_FLAG_SKIP) to skip the overlong part of the command.

The countermeasure of this attack is restricting the length of email addresses according to

section 4.5.3 of RFC 5321 [15] or upgrading Postfix.

4.3.  Line-breaks for SMTP servers

RFC  5321  clearly  states  that  only  CRLF  is  the  SMTP’s  command  line  separator.  In  other

words, neither single LF nor CR should occur in the command line. They should also not be

interpreted as a separator by command recipient.

During the research, none of the three MTAs we tested (Postfix,  Sendmail  and Exchange)

was  found  to  treat  single  CR  as  a  separator.  Neither  was  VT  (Vertical  Tab,  0x0B)  nor  FF

(Form  Feed,  0x0C).  However,  Postfix  and  Sendmail  were  confirmed  to  treat  LF  as  a

separator against the RFC text, whereas MS Exchange complies with the text.

This  incompliance  of  Postfix  and  Sendmail  may  result  in  a  vulnerability  if  both  the

application and SMTP client library handle only CRLF properly. However, we could not find

any realistic example that this incompliance leads to a vulnerability because many libraries

that properly handle CRLF seem to do the same for single LF, too.

␣␣…DATA␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣….[CRLF]␣QUIT[CRLF]␣2048bytesLong email address input

5.  Sender address attack

Although this paper focuses on the recipient email addresses, the sender address in "MAIL

FROM" command can obviously be another injection target as well.

When  performing  a  test  targeting  a  sender  address,  all  of  the  essential  SMTP  commands

must appear in order and without omission in the resulting SMTP transaction.

This means attack vectors need a modification.

Vector for recipient
rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

Vector for sender
sndr=from@example.jp>[CRLF]RCPT TO:attacker@example.org[CRLF]DATA[CRLF]

The latter vector is intended to replace the original recipient address with the attacker’s by

supplying a crafted sender address.

The resulting SMTP transaction is shown below:

6.1:
6.2:
6.3:
6.4:
7:
8:
9:
10:
11:

; response to 6.2
; response to 6.3

QUIT↵

250 Mail queued for delivery.↵

; response to 13

221 Closing connection. Good bye.↵

; response to 15

As  the  result,  only  by  manipulating  the  sender  address,  the  attacker  receives  an  email

message containing the original confidential message content:

>
RCPT TO:<original recipient address>
DATA
(original confidential message content)

; input 6.4
; input 10
; input 11
; input 12

Of course, the attacker can also utilize this bug for spamming just by appending a string like

"(spam content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]" at the end of the vector.

6.  Conclusion

This  paper  explained  how  the  SMTP  Injection  attack  through  a  crafted  recipient  email

address  works  and  showed  the  examples  of  vulnerable  SMTP  clients  and  the  possible

further attacks.

The countermeasure of this attack is to ensure that the email address being passed to "RCPT

TO" command is compliant to RFC 5321 in terms of syntax and length. The syntax rule is

defined in section 4.1.2 of the RFC, and  the length limit  is in  section  4.5.3.1.  Of course,  a

little more relaxed rule can be an option, as a small proportion of existing and actually used

addresses is known to be incompliant to the standard. Needless to say, when a relaxed rule

is employed, addresses containing line-breaks must not be allowed.

Note that, regarding the valid email address format, confusion between RFC 5321 and 5322

is sometimes seen; however, RFC 5321 should be referred in the context of SMTP.

At  MBSD  we  think  modern  SMTP  client  libraries  should  desirably  be  equipped  with  this

sort of validation mechanism, but it is not to say that the web application developers must

not perform the validation on their own. Whatever the case may be, an application is safe as

long as either the library or the application itself performs proper validation.

If  you  need  to  verify  whether  or  not  your  application  is  susceptible  to  the  attack  in  a

black-box manner, consider using the vector below (the most basic one):

rcpt=to@example.jp>[CRLF]DATA[CRLF](message content)[CRLF].[CRLF]QUIT[CRLF]

More advanced and somewhat library-specific vectors are shown in chapter 3.

If the application accepts a sender email address as an input, the vectors mentioned above

need a slight adjustment as described in chapter 5.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Debian Bug     : 851161

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the interpreter for the Ruby
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:

CVE-2015-9096

    SMTP command injection in Net::SMTP via CRLF sequences in a RCPT TO
    or MAIL FROM command.

CVE-2016-2339

    Exploitable heap overflow in Fiddle::Function.new.

CVE-2016-7798

    Incorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in the
    OpenSSL extension.

CVE-2017-0898

    Buffer underrun vulnerability in Kernel.sprintf.

CVE-2017-0899

    ANSI escape sequence vulnerability in RubyGems.

CVE-2017-0900

    DoS vulnerability in the RubyGems query command.

CVE-2017-0901

    gem installer allowed a malicious gem to overwrite arbitrary files.

CVE-2017-0902

    RubyGems DNS request hijacking vulnerability.

CVE-2017-0903

    Max Justicz reported that RubyGems is prone to an unsafe object
    deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which
    processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification
    can lead to remote code execution.

CVE-2017-10784

    Yusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability in
    the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the WEBrick log and
    potentially execute control characters on the victim's terminal
    emulator when reading logs.

CVE-2017-14033

    asac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    extension. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to
    cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2017-14064

    Heap memory disclosure in the JSON library.

CVE-2017-17405

    A command injection vulnerability in Net::FTP might allow a
    malicious FTP server to execute arbitrary commands.

CVE-2017-17742

    Aaron Patterson reported that WEBrick bundled with Ruby was vulnerable
    to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. It was possible for an
    attacker to inject fake HTTP responses if a script accepted an
    external input and output it without modifications.

CVE-2017-17790

    A command injection vulnerability in lib/resolv.rb's lazy_initialze
    might allow a command injection attack. However untrusted input to
    this function is rather unlikely.

CVE-2018-6914

    ooooooo_q discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the
    Dir.mktmpdir method in the tmpdir library. It made it possible for
    attackers to create arbitrary directories or files via a .. (dot dot)
    in the prefix argument.

CVE-2018-8777

    Eric Wong reported an out-of-memory DoS vulnerability related to a
    large request in WEBrick bundled with Ruby.

CVE-2018-8778

    aerodudrizzt found a buffer under-read vulnerability in the Ruby
    String#unpack method. If a big number was passed with the specifier @,
    the number was treated as a negative value, and an out-of-buffer read
    occurred. Attackers could read data on heaps if an script accepts an
    external input as the argument of String#unpack.

CVE-2018-8779

    ooooooo_q reported that the UNIXServer.open and UNIXSocket.open
    methods of the socket library bundled with Ruby did not check for NUL
    bytes in the path argument. The lack of check made the methods
    vulnerable to unintentional socket creation and unintentional socket
    access.

CVE-2018-8780

    ooooooo_q discovered an unintentional directory traversal in
    some methods in Dir, by the lack of checking for NUL bytes in their
    parameter.

CVE-2018-1000075

    A negative size vulnerability in ruby gem package tar header that could
    cause an infinite loop.

CVE-2018-1000076

    RubyGems package improperly verifies cryptographic signatures. A mis-signed
    gem could be installed if the tarball contains multiple gem signatures.

CVE-2018-1000077

    An improper input validation vulnerability in RubyGems specification
    homepage attribute could allow malicious gem to set an invalid homepage
    URL.

CVE-2018-1000078

    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage
    attribute.

CVE-2018-1000079

    Path Traversal vulnerability during gem installation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.5-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.1 packages.
