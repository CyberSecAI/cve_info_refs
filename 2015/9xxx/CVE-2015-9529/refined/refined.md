The provided content is a blog post announcing a security fix for Easy Digital Downloads. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions in WordPress when the third parameter passed to these functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is specifically related to how URLs are handled when using `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg`. These functions are used to modify URLs by adding or removing query parameters.
- The core issue is that if the URL provided as a parameter to these functions is not properly escaped or sanitized, it becomes vulnerable to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- While the blog post doesn't specify the exact impact, it can be inferred that attackers could potentially redirect users to malicious websites, inject malicious code, or perform other types of attacks by manipulating the URL parameters. This is a common risk associated with unescaped URLs in query parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the improper use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` with untrusted URLs as a parameter.
- An attacker could manipulate the third parameter of these functions with a crafted URL containing malicious payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to find a place in the Easy Digital Downloads plugin where `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` is used with a potentially controllable third parameter (URL). They would then need to craft a malicious URL as input and inject this into the vulnerable area.
- The attacker would also need to induce a user to click on the manipulated link/URL.
