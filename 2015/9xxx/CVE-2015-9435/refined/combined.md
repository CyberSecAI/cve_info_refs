It looks like the plugin is abandoned. Moreover, I bought a Pro version but it doesn‚Äôt work and nobody replies via the support email. I can‚Äôt even access my license key because the password restore doesn‚Äôt work on their website.
DO NOT use this plugin!

## Advisory:

# The OAuth2 Complete plugin for WordPress uses a pseudorandom number generator which is non-cryptographically secure

## Vulnerability

Last revised: July 22, 2015

The following refer to the generateAccessToken() function in library/OAuth2/ResponseType/AccessToken.php, and¬†the¬†generateAuthorizationCode() function in library/OAuth2/ResponseType/AuthorizationCode.php.

* These functions attempt to generate secure auth tokens, but do not use the WordPress random number generator. Instead they use a series of fallback calculations depending on which PHP version is being used. Some¬†of these calculations¬†are not crypographically secure:
* The first is mcrypt\_create\_iv(100, MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM). MCRYPT\_DEV\_URANDOM is expected to change to a different random value whenever it is called, but on Windows, on older versions of php it is known to be a constant value
* if no other functions (e.g. /dev/urandom) are¬†available then the access token is generated solely using mt\_rand(), microtime(), and uniqid().
* mt\_rand() (Mersenne twister) is not a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
* According to the documentation [mt\_rand()](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php) is also biassed towards even return values in some circumstances.
* According to the documentation [uniqid()](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php) is as secure a PRNG as microtime().
