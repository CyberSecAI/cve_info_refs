Description

esoTalk is a light-weight forum software written in PHP. In version 1.0.0g4 and
possibly prior versions, there is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search
because a given URL is echoed unencoded in multiple places.

Successful exploitation may lead to the injection of JavaScript keyloggers, the
stealing of cookies, or the bypassing of CSRF protection.
