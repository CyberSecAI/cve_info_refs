Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weak encryption algorithm used by ManageEngine OpManager to store device credentials (usernames and passwords) in its database. The encryption algorithm does not utilize a per-site key, making it vulnerable to reverse engineering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Weak Encryption:** The core issue is the use of an easily reversible encryption algorithm for sensitive data.
*   **Lack of Per-Site Key:** The encryption key is not unique per installation, meaning a single successful reverse engineering effort could allow decryption of credentials across multiple OpManager instances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker can decrypt stored usernames and passwords for managed devices.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With these credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the managed devices and potentially the broader network.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive device and network information could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection (Initial Access):** The description mentions "Abusing some SQL Injection on OpManager," which could be an initial attack vector for extracting the encrypted credentials from the database. This step isn't strictly part of the CVE itself but rather a prerequisite to exploit the weak crypto, according to this source.
2. **Credential Decryption:** The primary attack vector is the ability to decrypt credentials using the discovered algorithm. This is made possible by the weak encryption that does not use a per-site key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs access to the ManageEngine OpManager database. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.
*   **Reverse Engineering/Knowledge of Algorithm:** The attacker would need to reverse engineer the encryption algorithm to decrypt the credentials. The provided tool ("DecryptOpManager.java") suggests that this step is trivial.

**Summary:**

CVE-2015-9107 involves a weak encryption flaw in ManageEngine OpManager versions 11.x and 12.2. This vulnerability, when combined with SQL injection to extract the encrypted credentials, allows attackers to decrypt stored device credentials and gain unauthorized access to managed devices. The lack of a per-site key makes the vulnerability exploitable across multiple installations.
