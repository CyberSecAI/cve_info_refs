Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9551:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of a hidden form within the router's web management interface that allows execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hidden form for command execution:** The `/boafrm/formSysCmd` form is not intended for public access and lacks proper authentication.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The form is accessible without any authentication.
- **Direct system command execution:** The `sysCmd` parameter directly executes the given command as root.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.
- **Complete System Takeover:** The attacker can gain full control of the device.
- **Device compromise:** Once compromised, a threat actor can perform malicious activities like, DDoS, MitM, eavesdropping or further network attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/boafrm/formSysCmd` URL.
- **`sysCmd` parameter:** The malicious command is passed through the `sysCmd` parameter in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's management interface, which might be the LAN or if the backdoor from CVE-2015-9550 is exploited then the WAN interface of the device.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable without the need for any authentication or prior access.
