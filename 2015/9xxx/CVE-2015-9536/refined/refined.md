Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from the use of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` WordPress functions, where the 3rd parameter (a URL) is not properly escaped using `esc_url()`. This allows the possibility of injecting arbitrary URLs through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **URL Parameter Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of the URL passed as a parameter to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions. This can lead to the injection of malicious URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Redirect to Malicious Sites**: An attacker could inject a malicious URL, redirecting users to phishing sites or sites containing malware. 

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted URL parameters**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL and insert it as a parameter that gets passed to the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to influence the input to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions, specifically the 3rd parameter (URL) through a vulnerable vector within the application.
- They also need the ability to direct a user to the crafted link.

**Additional Details:**

- The blog post mentions that not all uses of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` are vulnerable. The vulnerability is present when the 3rd parameter is an unescaped or untrusted URL.
- This issue was addressed by automatically deploying a security update, suggesting a quick response by the developers.

This information confirms the vulnerability described is related to CVE-2015-9536.
