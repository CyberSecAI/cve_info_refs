Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed in version 1.0.3 of the Plotly WordPress plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin had a security issue related to how it handled user input, specifically when embedding Plotly graphs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injection:** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS attacks. This means that malicious users could inject client-side scripts (like JavaScript) into the plugin through the embedding mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful XSS injection could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser visiting the WordPress site, potentially leading to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, which could grant an attacker unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information from the user's browser, potentially including personal data.
    - **Website Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or functionality of the website for malicious purposes.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Plotly Graph URL:** An attacker would craft a malicious Plotly graph URL that contains embedded JavaScript code.
- **Embedding the Malicious URL:** The attacker would then embed this malicious URL into a WordPress post or page.
- **User Interaction:** When a user views the post or page, the malicious script embedded in the graph URL would be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Author-Level Access:**  The vulnerability was exploitable by users with author-level permissions, who have the ability to create or edit posts and pages where they can embed the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- This information is taken from the changelog entry in the plugin's description: "Fixed security issue that allowed XSS injection by authors."
- The fix was implemented in version 1.0.3 of the plugin.
