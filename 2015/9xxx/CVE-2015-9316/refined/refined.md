The provided content includes two sources. The first one is a description of the "WP Fastest Cache" plugin from the WordPress plugin directory, while the second one is an exploit description for a vulnerability in the same plugin. Let's analyze the exploit content.

**Exploit-DB Content Analysis:**

*   **CVE ID:** Although the provided content does not mention a CVE ID, it is related to a vulnerability that is not described in the description of CVE-2015-9316, thus it is a different vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** WP Fastest Cache, version 0.8.4.8.
*   **Vulnerability:** Blind SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The `$_POST["poll_id"]` parameter in the `wpfc_wppolls_ajax_request()` function within the `wp-polls.php` file is not properly sanitized. Although `strip_tags` is applied, and `mysql_real_escape_string`, the parameter is still vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization and lack of parameterized queries. Specifically the use of `mysql_real_escape_string` is not sufficient, and was deprecated.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject SQL queries that can lead to data exfiltration and other potential impacts to the application database. In this case, the provided example targets the `wp_users` table and attempts to extract the `user_pass` value of the first user.
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wpfc_wppolls_ajax_request` with a crafted `poll_id` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This does not require authentication.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided HTML form demonstrates a way to exploit the vulnerability by including a SQL injection payload in the `poll_id` parameter. It includes a time-based blind SQL injection payload to test the vulnerability.
*   **Solution:** Upgrade the plugin to version 0.8.4.9 or higher where this vulnerability was fixed.

**Summary of the identified vulnerability**

| **Root cause** | **Weakness** | **Impact** | **Attack vectors** | **Attacker capabilities** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Improper sanitization of the `poll_id` parameter in the `wpfc_wppolls_ajax_request()` function. | Vulnerable to SQL Injection due to use of `mysql_real_escape_string` instead of parameterized queries. | Data exfiltration of sensitive data from the database, potential compromise of the application and server through other SQL Injection possibilities | Crafted HTTP POST request with the vulnerable `poll_id` parameter to the `wpfc_wppolls_ajax_request` endpoint. |  Unauthenticated attacker that can send POST requests. |
