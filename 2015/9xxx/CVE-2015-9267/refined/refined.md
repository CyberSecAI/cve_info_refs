Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-9267:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The installers for E START products by GMO INSIGHT Inc. have an issue with their DLL search path. This results in the installers loading Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from insecure locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading:** The primary weakness is that the installers load DLLs from the `TEMP` environment variable or the installer's directory. This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one in the vulnerable locations. When the installer attempts to load the legitimate DLL, it will load the malicious one instead, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is local, as the attacker must place the malicious DLL on the victim's system.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, as the victim must run the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL into either:
    *   The directory specified by the `TEMP` environment variable.
    *   The same directory as the installer.
* The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in E START App Version 3.0.2.0 and earlier, and E START Update Center Version 2.0.8.0 and earlier.
*   The fix involves using the latest installers provided by the vendor.
*   The vulnerability is related to [CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html) (Uncontrolled Search Path Element).
*   The vulnerability is also related to CVE-2015-9268.
