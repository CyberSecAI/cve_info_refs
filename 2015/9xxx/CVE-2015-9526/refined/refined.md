The provided content discusses a security fix released for Easy Digital Downloads, a WordPress plugin. Based on the comments, the vulnerability is related to the usage of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises when the third parameter passed to the `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` functions is an unescaped or untrusted URL.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code was vulnerable to a type of injection that can be exploited using crafted URLs. Specifically, the lack of sanitization on the URL passed to `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` could allow malicious actors to inject arbitrary parameters to the URL.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** While the specific impact isn't detailed, the vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to redirect users to malicious websites or perform other actions by manipulating query parameters. It could also lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if not handled properly.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious parameters passed to the vulnerable functions.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the unescaped data and trick a user into clicking on it (e.g., via phishing or other social engineering).

The content provides more specific details than a generic CVE description would, explaining that the vulnerability is not due to the presence of `add_query_arg` or `remove_query_arg` themselves, but how their parameters are handled.
